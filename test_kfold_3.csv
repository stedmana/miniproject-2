Thats what you get when you let Diablo3 to develop an expansion (diablo3 has its moments, but its a truly boring grindy boneless game). Sure, grinding valor or whatever currency isnt the best system, but it offers you a sure payment for your work, as opposed to playing the lottery game on full tilt. Sure, you could have some tf/wf left in the game, but id rather FOCUS my upgrades, rather than get TF on an item I dont need, or random crap stats. 
IF you have played diablo, and its absolute sick rift grind system (get the fotm set to be even remotely useful, then grind the same pieces again in a ""TF/upgraded"" state to be stronger, or play the Kadala lottery) then you see, that you can basically draw a equal sign between legions and D3 loots system. These games are not the same, and the loot system should not be the same.
Basically it boils down to luck (as with legendaries). You will feel a sense of joy when you get the right leg/tf/wf, and utter dissapointment when you dont (or dont get loot at all). Kadala lottery (oh sorry, nethershard), is a weak way of offering consolation prize (use an 5k costing item, that says it will roll your spec item, but instead it gives you absolutely opposite stats you need, totally wasting your shards for that spec). 
I need, NEED, a way to keep hunting towards something. Right now i've lost all interest in doing mythics, because  as fun as they might be - i know in the end, the lottery gods will decide my pay.

194,"Those interested in some of the more colorful history around this should read up on The Devil's Brigade, who first came into action starting in Sicily. The First Special Service Force aka the Devil's Brigade / the Black Devils was the unified Canadian and American commando force who were created to fill the need of mountaineering and night patrol missions similar to the already created SAS in Britain. They recruited hunters, forestry workers, mountaineers and others with pioneer type backgrounds and then trained them in night tactics, small arms, independent tactics, hand-to-hand combat. This unit was the precursor to the Green Berets, Rangers and our airborne units (with traditions eventually leading to JTF). This unique unit had shared command from both countries and the experiences of both countries (and from British advisors) resulted in a commando doctrine that influenced special forces today. 

In Operation Husky they first saw action in a battle that required them to scale a steep mountainside where they surprised the German defenders and had to fight off counter attacks while advancing uphill. Later in the campaign they became infamous among the Germans for night patrols where they would leave behind calling cards with dead sentries designed to terrify them. That is when they became known as ""the black devils"" as they would camouflage their faces by blackening them.

This was a pretty good collection of oral histories from veterans of the campaign. https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Devil-Brigade-Special-Service/dp/0935553509

Therefore this leaves many women competing for the same position at a company, but that company wants a balance of men and women because hiring all women would be discrimination. Therefore there is a surplus of female applicants, aka supply is high and demand is low. Whatever woman they hire just takes the job, without considering she can get paid more to get her hands dirty elsewhere. And if she puts her foot down and demands a raise, she can be easily replaced by another woman who has also been avoiding dangerous jobs. White collar companies need to do more to hold onto their male employees, because there are less of them pursuing that particular line of work.

The rams line was also ranked 29th last year and maybe they were worse than that 2012 chiefs line (even though we had literally no other offensive option than JC).... Todd Gurley didn't do anything to help himself though. His [stats on FO](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb) have him as the 37th ranked RB last season.

Simple fact is yeah the Rams Oline is trash but Gurley was also trash last season and didn't do a damn thing to help. This sums it up

&gt;In the entire history of the NFL, there are 320 instances of a running back accumulating at least 275 carries in a single season. Among these 320 seasons, Gurley’s 2016 season ranks fifth-worst in yards per carry.

Again ... so? The Canadian government can talk reparations and shift responsibility for things like health care or self governance to these indigenous nations, but the average citizen doesn't have to give one raging red fuck about any of it. In fact, the average citizen might very well be happy that these transitions are happening, so that any ties between Canada and these other nations get largely severed, so that we can move forward without the ongoing encumbrances. Like I said, you can make governments honour treaties, but you can't make individual people give a shit about you and yours.

&gt; And yet, Germany paid reparations to Israel for decades after the Holocaust ended.

True, but Germany did cause a massive world war that cost a few hundred million people their lives, and also put into place a systemic factory system to murder millions of people, wholesale. The scale of their infringement is just a tiny bit larger than Canada's.  Again, though, even if Canada pays these reparations, the average citizen doesn't have to (and largely doesn't) give a fuck about the status of the language, culture and people in those other nations. 

Either there's future division between the indigenous nations and Canada, and then Canada doesn't have to do things like mention treaties in our citizenship oath, maintain a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs, subsidize APTN, subsidize education, provide health benefits, etc., or they mold into Canada.  As long as there's this push to claim independent nation status when it suits, and national benefits within Canada when IT suits, you're going to get pushback. Pick one. They are either Canadian, or they are their own nation.

&gt; Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).

&gt; Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.

&gt; The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.

&gt; In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were ""done"", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.

&gt; 2. American rock band:  Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis, released on the Cranbus label in 1973.

&gt; Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young.

&gt; Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others.

&gt; 3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow Ray from Detroit.

&gt; 4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin. Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988.

470,"**Start watching the minimap NOW.**

The minimap is your window of opportunity.  It lets you see opportunities to help a fight, it lets you see opportunities to avoid getting killed, and it lets you see opportunities that may be developing (such as the skull and crossbones that indicate that dragon is alive, or the fact that 4 of the enemy are heading towards middle tower and you probably need to be en route to help defend).  If you have access to a timer that you can make beep every 5 seconds, do so, and every time it beeps check the minimap.  At least *glance* at it.  But make it a habit that is as natural as breathing.

**The minimap will save your life.**

If there was a second thing, it would be to play selectively aggressive.  By selective, I mean to pick the safe times to play aggressively.  If you carefully select when you want to play aggressive, you will discover more about your champion.  You will learn to spot opportunities to be aggressive, and you will learn to detect those signs of aggression in the opponent.  

**The best way to die is when an enemy gets away with 15 hp but you died.**  On a larger scale, the best way for your whole team to die is if you all died but still managed to kill 4 of their team.  I say that's the best way because you tested your limits.  You learned something about your character, or the enemy, or *something* that might help you survive with 15 hp next time and the *enemy* dies. 

The third pitfall to avoid is to spend a moment thinking about what you want to build, browse the shop, and find what you want to buy.  In other words, get familiar with the items and think about why you would want to spend hard-earned gold on any particular thing.  On the topic of builds, don't be upset if someone criticizes your build.  *They could very well be wrong.*  Or they could be right.  Again, think about why somebody might be making a recommendation, and work from there.  However, if you are locked in to some build you found online, you will foolishly ignore even good advice and limit your own growth as a player.

Guides are *great*.  Guides can show you opportunities that you've missed, or give you new ideas to work off of.  However, they are inflexible.  If you blindly follow guides, the day will come where you will follow it to your own doom.  Don't start with guides.  You will fuck up and you will do great, but do it with your own brain.

Finally, and this one is big, **farming will never let you down**.  That's why so many people say ""last hitting creeps is #1 tip"" but it really isn't the #1 tip.  Farming is earning gold for getting the last hit on a creep.  The goal of the game is to bust down the enemy nexus, and the most reliable way to do that is to be stronger than your opponent.  You get stronger by earning gold and experience.  Every creep that the tower kills or that you allow the minions to kill is a missed opportunity to get slightly stronger than your opponent, and that advantage grows throughout the game.

If you ever think farming is weak, check the scoreboard when there seems to be a single player that's dominating the game.  I bet you 500 Riot Points that the player who is doing the dominating will have the highest number of creeps killed.

PS - attack speed is not a great stat to stack.  If you're working on an AD character, consider balancing attack speed, damage, crit %, armor penetration and **survivability** such as Banshee's Veil.",leagueoflegends

Yes they are? Women are sexual. They like men. They like their bodies. They like seeing them. Not saying you should send them unsolicited. But for the record, the guys doing this are often just fishing and sending those pics to any girl they can as a low effort way to potentially find interest. So it isn't like they ALL think that women totally want random dick pics. 


=

&gt;Absolutely, totally, irrefutably, irrevocably have never had a positive reaction to a dick pic.

I definitely have. I have even had girls ask for one, and initiate the dirty pictures first. Women can be sexual too. This idea that they are ""totally wired differently"" is nonsense. I am not saying they are exactly the same as men either, but they definitely have interest in the bodies of men that they find attractive. 


=

&gt;They may pretend to like your dick pic in order to please your need for affirmation, but deep down the ladies are all like ... eeewwww.

When you speak in absolutes, you are almost always going to end up being wrong. This is one of those times. Again, this isn't something every woman will want, and you shouldn't just send them out of the blue, but women can enjoy seeing mens bodies and a penis is definitely something that can turn women on.

&gt;&gt;07/24/2017 11:04 AM Posted by [GreyFalcon](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758326009?page=1#post-1)

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;###### **Junkrat:**

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;- ###### Concussion Mine

&gt;&gt;, damage reduced to 90

&gt;&gt;- ###### Junkrat Trap

&gt;&gt;, increase damage to 110

&gt;&gt;- ###### Concussion mine

&gt;&gt;, reduce cooldown to 4 seconds

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;**###### Results

&gt;&gt;**

&gt;&gt;- Trap+Mine = 200 damage

&gt;&gt;- Grenade+Mine = 210 damage

&gt;&gt;- Trap is way more deadly. 

&gt;&gt;- Can't spam 2 mines and kill 200HP. For balance reasons.

&gt;&gt;- Grenade + Mine is a much more frequent and consistent combo

&gt;&gt;- Junkrat's survivability and mobility goes way up because he can use a ConcMine every 4 seconds to engage/retreat.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;This is pretty close to what we're trying with him, and what will likely be on the PTR when it comes back up. Currently on our internal builds Junkrat has 2 charges of his Concussion Mine. This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2. It has been a ton of fun to play with so far.

&gt;

&gt;We're also looking at making his ult a bit better. We're experimenting with a movement speed increase or a health increase on the tire. We wouldn't do both things but in either case it should be more reliable to use in more situations.

It's one thing to say that flagrant fouls were more brutal than nowadays, because that's true. But plan ole hard-nosed man-on-man defense is just as physical today *without hand-checking* than ever. Once again, look at the playoff games of today. To say that modern NBA players play a less physical game is not true *except* in cases of hard fouls.

I do not agree that the White Stripes would be just as popular without Meg. For one thing, as I mentioned before, Jack says himself that there was something so raw and primal about Megs drumming that it unleashed this side of him that played his guitar a certain way. That is what makes the White Stripes so good IMO. Besides, look at The Dead Weather, (Jack's new project), they have a good drummer and Jack is writing the songs and they are not very popular.

770,"&gt;source? Gooddell suspends people all the time. like the deflator guy.

Yes but the original guy I was arguing with suggested that Zeke's an employee of the NFL, which is not the case. He's a member of the Cowboys organization, and just because he plays in the NFL does not give the commissioner the right to tell the Cowboys how to treat him.

&gt;okay, replace 'arrested' with 'subject of criminal investigations' if you think splitting that hair helps your argument.

I would encourage you to take a criminal justice class before you repeat the idea that ""getting arrested"" and ""being questioned"" are the same thing. 

&gt;From the entertainment company's perspective, the evidence and process of law is irrelevant.

Uh huh. So you think the NFL can investigate domestic abuse better than the police? Or do you think NFL players should be suspended whenever they're accused of something? How long should Dez's suspension be for ""the dez tape"" that never existed but made the NFL look bad very briefly?

&gt;And, again, the bad PR isn't coming from skip bayless, its coming from news sources the non-nfl fans watch, like the evening news and the newspaper.

So you think that giving Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity the power to ruin players' careers is a good idea? Because you're literally advocating for suspending players based on what the evening news says about the NFL. What am I missing that makes this okay?

&gt;lol, You going to make this same limp excuse for Pacman Jones and Vontaze Burfict in a couple weeks, too? You probably get all teary eyed when Ray Lewis talks about the Lord, too, right?

Deflect, deflect, deflect. I think that's on page 3 of the ""I'm losing an argument on the internet, now what?"" guide. If you want to continue this line of discussion then feel free to answer my original question, copied here for your convenience: 

&gt;He wasn't questioned, detained, arrested, charged with a crime of any sort, or convicted of a crime of any sort. Yet hundreds of talking heads have crucified him for ""being in a bad place."" So we're literally punishing Zeke for being in the vicinity of a crime? Is he not allowed to leave his house?

&gt;Here's hoping his defense attorney can frame that a little better than you just did. He's under investigation for domestic assault and he goes and flashes someone's titty from behind, that she's clearly not enjoying? I'm surprised to find someone willing to defend this in light of all circumstances. And it ignores the 100mph speeding ticket, too.


Uh, what crime is Zeke's defense attorney arguing in your imagination? Because Zeke hasn't been charged with a crime. 

&gt;he goes and flashes someone's titty from behind, that she's clearly not enjoying?

I agree it's distasteful, but the woman in question has already said she's not going to press any charges. Zeke will never have to face a courtroom for that action, however distasteful it was.

As I said in my original comment, he's appealing the speeding ticket. Have you never heard of cases where speeding tickets were issued erroneously? 

&gt;I'm surprised to find someone willing to defend this in light of all circumstances.

You're innocent until proven guilty. The idea that we should punish people before they're convicted is disgusting to me. Punishment comes *after* the conviction, not before.

&gt;I said the NFL shouldnt be beholden the the court's schedule or outcome.

When investigating whether an actual crime took place, what makes you think the NFL can investigate and reach a decision in a better manner than actual police, lawyers, and judges? You're basically arguing for a kangaroo court where players go before Judge Roger and are suspended because Skip Bayless and Rachel Maddow are talking about you in a mean way. 

&gt;And if you're unaware that court timelines can be fudged by friendly judges to allow players to play, refamiliarize yourself with the Williams Wall (or just about any other college football related scandal of the last 25 years). The Williamses were supposed to be suspended all of 2009, but a judge reversed the NFL's decision and kicked the hearing out far enough for the vikes to finish their season, which ended at the NFC championship game. Then they let the NFL ban them after they were both basically retiring.

Thank you for the example, but I still don't see enough evidence that the NFL should act as a governing body more knowledgeable than the legal system.

Yes, and your argument is that this is tipped workers being left behind. It isn't.

Let me ask you something, it will require critical thought for a second. We're in a race and I'm going 90 MPH while you're going 60 MPH. You then raise your Speed to 70 MPH and mine stays the same. Can you claim that you're leaving me behind?

Firstly, that's exactly what the first comment in this thread argued. The argument was that they're ""paid below minimum wage"" and that's not the case.

There's nothing I've been wrong on here. You've failed at pedantry, you've failed at semantics, you've failed at every approach you've tried. Minimum wage does not leave tipped workers behind, they are still paid above and at the very worst equal to minimum wage.

&gt; Giorgio Moroder (born Hansjörg Moroder on April 26, 1940 in Ortisei, Italy) is an Italian record producer, songwriter and performer, whose groundbreaking work with synthesizers during the 1970s was a significant influence on new wave, techno and electronic music in general. Particularly well known are Donna Summer's disco hits produced by Moroder, including ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""I Feel Love"". Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees.

&gt; Often collaborating with lyricist Pete Bellotte, Moroder scored a number of hits in his own name including ""Son Of My Father"" in 1972 and ""From Here to Eternity"" in 1977 under the name Giorgio, and in the following year releasing ""Chase"", the theme from the film Midnight Express and sold well elsewhere. All were hits in the UK. The full movie score for Midnight Express won him his first Academy Award for best film score in 1978.

&gt; In 1985, Moroder worked with Phil Oakey, frontman of the popular synthpop group, The Human League, to make the album Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder. The following year, Moroder collaborated with his protege Harold Faltermeyer (of ""Axel F."" fame) and lyricist Tom Whitlock to create the score for the popular film Top Gun (1986), with the most noteworthy hit being the Berlin classic, ""Take My Breath Away"", which went on to become a huge hit for the group.

&gt; He also scored other popular films in the 1980s including American Gigolo, Flashdance, The NeverEnding Story, Thief of Hearts, Electric Dreams, Scarface and Cat People(in collaboration with David Bowie). The latter score has recently regained popularity due to its use in the popular computer game Grand Theft Auto III. Moroder's ""From Here To Eternity"" and ""The Chase"" were also used in the Sony PSP game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. 

&gt; In 1984, Moroder compiled a new restoration and edit of the famous silent film Metropolis and provided a new modern rock-and-roll soundtrack to the film. 
His song ""Tears"" was sampled and used as the basis of the DJ Shadow song ""Organ Donor"" on his 1996 album Endtroducing......

&gt; On September 20, 2004 Moroder was honored at the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony, held in New York, when he was inducted for his many outstanding achievements and contributions as producer. In 2005, he was given the title of Commendatore by Azeglio Ciampi.

&gt; In 2005, a great deal of his work (including the Cizeta-Moroder supercar he co-produced in the mid 90s with Claudio Zampolli) was used in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, and was the entire playlist of the Flashback FM radio station.

&gt; Giorgio Moroder is one of the numerous composers interested in writing the theme tune of the 2008 Bejing Olympic Games. This is not the first theme song Moroder composed for the Olympic games. ""Hand in Hand"" was regarded as the best ever Olympic theme song for the 1988 Seoul Olympics by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch.

&gt; Moroder contributed to Daft Punk's 2013 studio album Random Access Memories, admitting that he had been a fan of their song ""One More Time"" before working with the group. His voice and story is featured on the album's track ""Giorgio by Moroder"". On the track he states, ""My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt;To get teen terror suspect Omar Khadr to cooperate, a former U.S. Army interrogator testified Thursday, he told the wounded Canadian a ""fictitious"" tale of an Afghan youth who was gang-raped in an American prison and died.

Threats - not torture.

https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2008/03/26/interrogator_i_didnt_hurt_khadr.html

&gt;""Omar was pretty much my first big case,"" Claus said, noting that they'd talk for six to eight hours a day. ""With Omar I spent a lot of time trying to understand who he was and what I could say to him or do for him, whether it be to bring him extra food or get a letter out to his family ... I needed to talk to him and get him to trust me.""

&gt;""They're trying to imply I'm beating or torturing everybody I ever talked to,"" Claus said by telephone yesterday. ""I really don't care what people think of me. I know what I did and I know what I didn't do.""

So Claus pleads guilty to torturing a secondary inmate, then in an interview says he didn't torture Khadr - that he tried to Khadr to trust him.

And you take that to be a confession to torturing Khadr.

It kind of goes back to the deficiencies of fielding percentage as a measure of ability.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/dfea8b0fefc54726a664edf6c62687cb.png)  

&gt; Pizzicato Five (often nicknamed ""P5"") is a legendary Japanese group that formed in 1984. Arguably the first group to popularize shibuya-kei from underground circles, they also later on began experimenting with the style, with what some called an innovative genre all their own, blending traditional Japanese pop, alternative, soul, funk, jazz, ye-ye, acoustic folk, and early electronic music, among others. They are also perhaps best known to audiences in the west in their later incarnation as a duo of Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu (小西康陽).

&gt; They are widely credited to have spearheaded the ""Shibuya-kei"" movement of Tokyo in the 90s, along with Flipper's Guitar. 

&gt; They are known for their eclectic and energetic compositions, which often sound like ""new"" releases from the late 1960s hipster scene. Their catchphrase--""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular""--captured the group's ironic stance but eager attitude. The group broke up in March 2001.

&gt; A hugely prolific group, Pizzicato Five would release at least an album-per-year along with various EPs and remix albums during their 16 year-career.

&gt; Both Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) currently enjoy solo careers - with Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) producing other artists ranging from Puffy and SMAP to Cornelius and kahimi karie(カヒミ・カリィ) - alongside collaborative remix compilations - from Ella Fitzgerald and The Supremes to classic Disney and Thunderbirds (as in Super-Marionated) music on his Shibuya-based Readymade Records label.  

&gt; On Thursday March 31st, 2011, exactly 10 years after Pizzicato Five disbanded, Konishi Yasuharu announced a new solo project called Pizzicato One.  The first release, titled One and Ten Very Sad Songs, consists of covers of English songs, each featuring vocals by various internationally-known artists from around the world.

1. OSX IS based on BSD, but BSD has distinct differences from Linux, including the base licensing differences between GPL and BSD licenses, i.e. Linux you MUST publish source code, BSD allows binary only distribution. That is likely the reason why OSX is BSD based and not Linux based, but you loose the 'guarantee' that the source will be available to tweak/modify as you wish, which is one of the advantages Linux has over both Windows and OSX. Obviously this only extends to the OS, as you can use other-licensed tools on each OS.

2. Its UNIX compatible, which means nothing in relation to Linux (which is Unix based, but not ported or restricted) or windows (which has nothing to do with Unix). Its really only saying ""this is a port of a server based system thats known for stability and security.

3. Both Windows and Linux are flexible in terms of hardware. BSD is somewhat flexible but less so, and OSX is even less flexible than BSD.

There are things you can do on a Windows and Linux machine that just aren't that easy on a Mac machine, and vice versa. At the end of the day, OSX is an OS meant for simplicity, and thus abstracts a lot of things away by deciding how they will be done. This is actually a good thing, as typically the decision of how something is going to be done is made properly, and the OS is easier and better for it. Those that are more specific in how they are using their system, or who do things outside the 95% typical use patters will have more trouble with Macs than they will with Windows, and more trouble with macs and windows then they will with Linux. 

SO yeah, Macs are more or less as flexible as pc's, with the exception of hardware support which is by design. This doesn't mean that flexibility is as easily achieved with a mac, or that the ease of use of a mac will be found on a windows or linux machine (far from it actually)",funny
1057,"I see what you're saying, but I don't think the radio is that influential. They just tend to play music that appeals to the most people (and understandably so, I guess), which leads to things like country and rap sounding the same. 

Not trying to be a gatekeeping asshole, but there's a difference between someone who listens to country radio in the car and someone who really enjoys country music and listens to different artists, full albums etc etc. Not that there's a problem with the first type of person; that's totally fine. Like you said, that's probably even the majority of people who claim the genre as their own. 

It's just that only listening to the radio gives you a rough idea of what music is like, but it's never the full story of a certain genre.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

People who are talkative in raid are typically talkative outside raid too. They will like to play with other talkative people. People who consistently put in effort to make groups and run keys find a consistent group.

You didn't answer my other question which was if they need DPS why bring you, specifically? If the only thing you contribute is high damage a PUG can do that.

You can change guilds but I think the same thing will keep on happening. People try to include new players make them feel at home and welcome but eventually the ""smell"" wears off and if you don't put in time building relationships outside raid you won't have any.

Really not different than a new kid in school getting attention for the first couple weeks. After that they either make friends or are forgotten. Can change schools again but that's not really a solution.

Rotations were **way** simpler during TBC though. One Button macros were a thing (even in WotlK for some classes) and some classes got away spamming a single spell 95% of the time (WLs for example).

Also talent choices were rather trivial when it comes to actually changing anything gameplay related.

1186,"&gt; Weather. Patriots play outside in a place that has very, very different weather compared to many other teams when it comes to the time playoffs roll around.

Absolutely. Considering Denver, NE, Seattle, and GB have had some of the best success at home in the playoffs of late and far less on the road I think that's easily a factor. Consider also that Indy, Pittsburgh, San Diego and KC(all highly successful centrally located teams) have not lived up to their home field advantage near as much in the playoffs.

&gt;Time zone changes. That late in the season, players' body clocks are used to very specific things. Denver playing a prime-time game in New England feels like the middle of the night to Denver players. It's not always that drastic, but I think the different start times and time zone changes can really mess with players.

Maybe, that would take a long time to track. Might make a different post on that one day.

&gt;Bye weeks. Getting a week to rest and prepare AND not have to travel is a huge overall advantage.

Not as much imo. I'll look into it but consider how frequently Manning's #1 seed Colts went 1 and done in the playoffs. The Broncos in 2012 and a few others come to mind as well. For a long time there was a stigma that the week off was actually a *bad* thing. 

&gt;Quality of team. Not the other teams, but the Patriots. The years they tend to get the 1 seed, they also tend to be really, really good (and generally healthy). Could be said of any team, I'm sure, but I think that the Patriots 1 seed teams have been historically good, not just pretty good.

Of course, to an extent. However, consider that in their losses they were the #2 seed in 2015, #4 playing the #3 in 2006, #2 seed in 2013, #1 seed in 2011, and 18-0 in 2007 I don't think there's been any correlation to their seeding and their losses.",nfl

(Props to her though because it was a tough situation and every frame had the beating in it somewhere.) I have only seen this done with a few other videos - notably Zapruder and Rodney King. Both times they were done by hand. 

While doing it, I figured I could cobble together some scripting that would make it go faster by letting you pick the control point and at least one horizontal or vertical line on each frame. That would give you enough information for a single translation and a rotation, which is all that I did in Gimp. It's always a good idea to do it the hard way once before you write software. Maybe next time, I will hack something together. The panorama software called Hugin has shown that one can find similar features in different images automatically (as well as correcting for lens effects) so it should be possible to do this completely in software with current know-how. 

As it was, each second of video took me about one hour to edit. It's fiddly work as well; kind of like being at the optometrist (better or worse?) while adjusting each frame one pixel left/right/up/down or 0.1 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Point is if someone is willing to pay that much for the least valuable franchise in the NHL, they are committed. It's like when people laugh at the NHL for expanding a Vegas team but the reality is there's an owner who is willing to pay 500 million to have a team in Vegas. ",hockey

**Episode 2 Thoughts**

* Aha, found the comment face in the OP [](#kotori)

* Honoka and Kotori are both lovable dorks.

* So I guess they’re going to be called the μ’s, but as an engineering major, all I can think of is the metric prefix for micro.  It also doesn’t help that Muse is one of my favorite bands either.

* This episode make me go check to see if I could still do pushups.  Barely got to 20…

* Actually, that’s a very good point.  What if they suck during the performance?  That could actually put the school in an even worse position.  Never thought of that myself until she said it.

* Idol music just sounds weird without all the hype and synth behind it.  Maki still sounds great though, albeit a bit autotuned and processed if anything.

* Either that’s just the ED or they literally just recruited everyone through one montage.  It’s probably the former, but that’s...um...hmm...

* I feel like I’m gonna love the girl with the maracas in the ED.  She looks like she’s having so much fun.

* First live already?  Dang.  Though the Idolm@ster had their first live by Episode 3 as well, so who am I to judge?

* Overall, nice episode today.  I adore the character interactions between the main trio.  Goofy antics always get me.

* [**Sabagebu!**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabage-bu) - about a survival game club. Technically airsoft but they certainly play it like it's real.
* [**Gungrave**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/267/Gungrave) - Don't know too much about it but it's a little older, fairly well received show about mafia-type stuff and has gun in the name, so I imagine it's a good place to look.
* [**Golgo 13 (2008)**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4039/Golgo_13_TV) - modern version of a classic manga about a hitman. It's long and idk the ratio of good gunfights it'll have but it's bound to have something.

* [**Maxlax**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/252) - 1/3 of Bee Train's ""girls with guns"" trilogy
* [**Noir**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/272/Noir) - 2/3 - more noir/spy themed
* [**El Cazador de la Bruja**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2030) - 3/3 - Western themed

* [**Upotte!**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12317/Upotte) - the girls are literally anthropomorphized guns. I hear it's not super good, but if you're a gun otaku it might be fun. It may be primarily SoL rather than action though. Just thought I'd throw it out.

&gt; Thomas Earl Petty (born 20 October 1950 in Gainesville, Florida) is an American musician, singer, composer and songwriter. 
After working with his early bands The Sundowners, The Epics, and Mudcrutch (which also included future Heartbreakers members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench) he began his recording career with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers when the band broke onto the national music scene with their 1976 self-titled debut album. Still, it took America a full year to catch up to the album. ""Breakdown"" was re-released to radio and became a Top 40 hit in 1977 after word filtered back the band was creating a firestorm in England. 
He was also a member of The Traveling Wilburys, along with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison. Petty and the Heartbreakers also toured as a backing band for Bob Dylan.

&gt; Petty is a vocal critic of the modern recording industry, including the disintegration of independent radio stations.

&gt; Petty has been supported by his band, The Heartbreakers, for the majority of his career. He has occasionally released solo work, as is the case with his 2006 effort, Highway Companion, on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation himself. Examples of other solo albums include Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers

&gt; His latest release is a reunion of Mudcrutch. Read more on Last.fm.

Universal's Islands of Adventure currently employs the Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four, while Universal Studios Japan employs Spider-Man. Per contract, Disney World and Tokyo Disney cannot install these characters in their parks. However, the contract allows these parks to install any Marvel characters not currently used or connected to the characters used at the Universal theme parks within the same region.

1635,"&gt; HAS HE MET THE KID. HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

The point of the movie is Tony barely knows him and through these events gets to know him. He does expect telling him ""stay close to the ground"" is good enough. At the start of the film he sees him as a kid with training wheels on, not an avenger. And definitely sees him as team iron man, not some captain america type who will keep fighting for what's right no matter how many times he gets put down.

&gt; SHIELD? Where were they?

It not entirely unbelievable that they've been selling the weapons and not getting caught but there were people on it. The FBI were notified and then managed to get a taskforce on the ferry pretty quickly, indicating to me there may have been a team with an open investigation there.

&gt; Don't like Aunt May knowing. Just don't.

It works OK in ultimate Spidey. I think Jon Watts and Marisa Tomei can make it work, and it adds a new point of stress for Peter in upcoming films, especially since he won't be clashing with Tony. it's a risky play but we've already had 6 whole movies now where May doesn't know, might as well try something different.

1649,"Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors and neutron generators. The radioactive properties of tritium are very useful. By mixing tritium with a chemical that emits light in the presence of radiation, a phosphor, a continuous light source is made. This can be applied to situations where a dim light is needed but where using batteries or electricity is not possible or practical. Rifle sights and exit signs are two examples of where this phenomenon is commonly used. The phosphor sights help increase nighttime firing accuracy and the exit signs can be life saver if there is a loss of power. The radioactive decay product of tritium is a low energy beta that cannot penetrate the outer dead layer of human skin. Therefore, the main hazard associated with tritium is internal exposure from inhalation or ingestion. In addition, due to the relatively long half life and short biological half life, an intake of tritium must be in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. Although, in keeping with the philosophy of ALARA, internal exposure should be kept as low as practical.

In other words, you don't think you're putting words in my mouth. you assume that when one movie has an influence, it could not have another. especially if they are closely related, my god! they then operate in vacuum of influence in which one is a direct product of another, surely.

I don't think Tarantino ripped it off necessarily, but yes I do think he was heavily influenced. Which he was. he was the head judge on the board that gave Oldboy its award at Cannes while he was making the Kill Bill movies and was more than enthused. This interview with Park shows Tarantino's utter astonishment with the film. He supposedly cried multiple times. doubt that happens to him often. 

Secondly, don't be a dick. this is something your parents may have missed, or maybe your a ""businessman"" or lawyer so it works to your advantage in some way, but chill out. be less condescending. it helps nobody, especially not your argument.

Thirdly, how is ""mysterious initial wrong done unto the main character resulting in, or consisting of, an extended confinement"" vague. And how does this happen at all in Pulp fiction. first of all, there's no single heroine in Pulp Fiction for it to happen to. and secondly who is imprisoned or confined in some way (when the two are confined and raped that is at the end of the plot line, and actually ends two sprees of vengeance), and by whom, and how does this initial wrong send this non-existent heroine into a spree of exacted revenge only to find that their initial feelings must now be construed through a new reality (my other vague categorization). please, name another film in which this actually happens. and on top of that I want the stylistic elements of a drawn out 1-on-many fight scene that pulp fiction does not have. and the cut up plot line that pulp fiction does have, congrats.",movies

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1809,"Thunder with KD go to finals against Lebron's Heat. They shake things up a little and take Warriors superteam to game 7 of the WCF. Saying that things ""didn't work"" ir ""failed"" with Russ and KD is saying championship or gtfo, which like i said, is a ridiculous standard to set. They were literally the best team in the nba except for unprecedented superteams, twice.

Westbrook then shows us all that he can be vastly better than we realized when he's not the second option and takes a not-great team to the playoffs almost by himself. Now he gets one of the best pfs in the league to help him. You can keep calling it not exciting if you want, but watching russ have great help instead of watching russ be great help for kd is a different team. Pg will be their second option, which is totally new for him, and russ gets to be number one with a competent number two, which will also be new. There is plenty to be excited about with okc.",nba

In 1942 Switzerland had abolished the death sentence from civil law on a federal level, but in military law death sentences were still possible.

Most, if not all, of them were sentenced because they had disclosed/sold sensitive information to the Nazis.

No it's far, far, less than that and also he had nowhere near a majority or even equal share when he left. As I said in my original comment:
&gt;worth *less than* a tenth [emphasis added]

He left in Q1 2008 it's first major investment was in 2013 Q3 at $70million for 5%. That's a valuation of $1.4 billion but that's also nearly 5 years after he left. It was also a cash infusion value/expansion investment of seed capital not a buyout. That money was part of what helped them grow to a billion.
So 5 years before that (considering he left before they made any of the agressive multimedia moves) it was probably worth still 10x less than that or according to his cofounder about not following Gavin's plan ""we would still be 8 people in a Williamsburg loft"". That's when Gavin left. He walked away from a de versification strategy that made everyone else billionaires. He walked away before they diversified and thus before they started making any real money. 2007-2008 was when the first started explosive growth rather than the slow growth they had in the 90's-mid 00's while he was around. It was likely closer to 100 or 200 mil at most...which isn't bad but considering he wasn't even close to being the majority owner and he pissed a lot of it away on failed ventures since...

US troops would be authorised to deploy there, ostensibly to keep the peace, but in truth to create a demilitarised zone between the Syrian Golan and the rest of the country. Iranian troops would not be allowed to approach Israël. Consequently, the Golan, illegally occupied by Israël for forty years, would be considered de facto as annexed, even if the word would never be used.

2055,"I think you'd probably have to do a full-on anime adaptation of FC/SC (and eventually sequels for Zero/Azure/Cold Steel) and then present the 3rd as a series of OVAs.

Have some of the episodes focus on the Moon/Star Door stories and what's going on with the other characters, but just present them as standalone epilogues/specials for SC without directly connecting them to 3rd's plot. Then spend several episodes (or a movie) on a pared-down version of the 3rd's main story, focusing on Kevin &amp; Ries and skipping anything that isn't integral to that arc.

The only character other than Kevin &amp; Ries who really gets meaningful development in the main plot of the 3rd is [TitS 3rd](/s ""Renne""), so you could truncate the story pretty well without losing anything important as long as you adapted the Door stories separately.

&gt;Matthew 5:17-20King James Version (KJV)

&gt;17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

&gt;18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

&gt;19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.


Last I checked, heaven and earth are still here. Consider carefully His admonishment against teaching others to ignore the Law or parts of it (not the rulings of the Pharisees, but the Law of God given to Moses which Christ lived and taught in full).


&gt;John 15:10King James Version (KJV)

&gt;10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.


While Christ says the essence of the Law (or the ""point of it/ summation of it"" if you will) is to ""love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and your neighbor as yourself"", He does not diminish or take away from what God has given. 

Modern Christianity is only loosely based on Christ's actual teachings and only vaguely centered around following Him. For further information on this distortion one need only read the Gospels then read Paul's writings (spoiler: Paul does not teach the same thing Christ did, and actually contradicts Him while claiming to serve Him). Also, the very opening of Revelation has Christ give praise to the church in Ephesus (a church Paul spent much time with) for recognizing ""one who claims to be an apostle and is not"". Guess who called himself the ""greatest apostle""? Paul. On this distinction I would GREATLY encourage even just an afternoon's worth of research.

Anyway, back to the point/reply, there is no separate covenant or doing away with the Old Testament. That does not mean that Christians are to be dicks. We are commanded to love with the same mercy and care that He showed to others. He is the example, and for those that would judge He gave a telling quote:


&gt;Matthew 7King James Version (KJV)

&gt;1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

&gt;2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

&gt;3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

&gt;4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

&gt;5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.


Mankind is unfit to judge one another as no individual on earth is a perfect and flawless being. Thus, we are to leave that to God and His Christ, who are. 

This does NOT mean that one is relegated to passively accepting evil or not encouraging others along a more righteous path; one need only look at Christ's actions in life to confirm this (""you are forgiven, go now and *sin no more*"", emphasis mine, as well as chasing the money changers and His various other admonishments of willful deceivers such as the Pharisees, defilers such as money changers abusing the house of God, etc)

**TL;DR** Teaching that the Law has changed or been done away with directly goes against the teachings of Christ Himself (who is the highest authority in this matter), but this does not mean that we humans are fit to be arbiters of the Law and the Commandments. We are to show mercy and love to one another, to guide by the light of a life lived by Christ's example and in proper communion with God, because we all fall short in one way or another.",funny

You don't get to just 'view' law into being.  There is considerable legal agreement that the UK is actually under no legal obligation (for the full bill) post-Brexit and it is ridiculous to treat it as if it has broken legal commitments when it has not (the EU's own lawyers have admitted that most of what appears in the bill is not legally enforceable: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/06/100bn-brexit-bill-legally-impossible-enforce-european-commissions/).

If the EU is willing to negotiate then they do not, presumably, actually see these as legal obligations at all.",europe

2582,"While I enjoy overwatch, I actually dislike this stance a lot. I would prefer to see more balance going on, but I come from playing mobas, and maybe that spoils me a little with the constant balance changes to heroes and League and other mobas I have played. 

Yes, each balance patch does cause what Jeff Kaplan refers to as artificial meta changing, as the patches are the developers buffing things that are weak and nerfing things that are strong. But the pro level matters the most to me, and yet I always see myself as a casual player. The reason it matters is for the viewing experience, and if Overwatch League is going to have the viewer numbers and stadium numbers they want, the game has to be balanced very heavily toward the pro side, much like traditional sports where the majority are viewers who don't play, Overwatch will need similar numbers as the player base isn't nearly large enough to support filling arenas every week. 
 
This leads to a point regarding balance, is it not fun for casuals to play a game balanced for pros? Well that can depend on the kind of game, I think in Overwatch you can balance for the pro scene and still offer players in the casual scene a good experience. Basically removing things that are very exploitable by pros but keeping the core experience the same. The main issue players have is viability. Right now the meta is considered stale because without a new hero release every month or two or major balance changes every month or even a new map that provides advantages for particular heroes we won't see changes in the meta. This is due to the 1% idea, if something is even 1% better or easier to execute then it will be played by pros, and subsequently played by everyone else because if the guys doing it for a living think it is the best and casual players who log much fewer hours want to win, they will play what others have spent time researching. You see it most often in mobas with item builds or talent picks, players copycat because they know it works, and rather than invest time in doing R&amp;D it is better to hop on the bandwagon.

That being said, what does that mean for Blizzard, it means they might need to be more aggressive with buffs toward characters outside the meta, I think the characters in the meta are often strong due to their mechanics and not necessarily their numbers, where the characters outside the meta can't compete, and the roster is too small for those characters to see viability. If there were bans and no mirroring and a roster of about double the heroes you would see different picks, but right now about 8 heroes are viable out of 32 or so.... that is pretty rough.

The intent to receive something ""Of value"" from a foreign national. Which is illegal. He can try to call it whatever the fuck he wants to try to downplay the situation, that doesn't change the facts.

&gt; Even if this is of any value,

It is. Information is something of value, this was settled in two separate court cases, once in 1963, and again in 1980 where the ruling was further reviewed and once again confirmed to be factual.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fd757fce263c4ff69a8291123323be93.png)  

&gt; The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter, novelist, pianist and guitarist John Darnielle. He has the distinction of being named by the The New Yorker magazine as 'America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist'; in its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine dubbed Darnielle one of the '100 Best Living Songwriters'. Darnielle’s lyrics are erudite and compassionate and filled with imagery that reference classical literature, religion, mythology, culture, art, and history. Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on Tallahassee are fictional, but that We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and other more recent work are partially autobiographical.

&gt; Darnielle began performing under the name the Mountain Goats in 1991 in Claremont, California, where he attended Pitzer College and worked as a psychiatric nurse. The band's name, the Mountain Goats, is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song Yellow Coat. Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band, The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

&gt; Highly prolific, since the early 90s Darnielle has released over a dozen Mountain Goats albums, 6 full-length cassettes, various 7” singles, 10"" and 12"" EPs and has contributed to compilations and label samplers too numerous to mention. As of November 2006, the Mountain Goats’ song catalog encompasses 452 songs, a fair number of which have only been played live. Among this bewildering number of tunes is a song cycle named the “Alpha” series, about a dysfunctional couple, as well as one named the “Going To…” series, about people going someplace or other, usually not for fun but rather to flee from a bad situation in their lives. The last series alone totals over 40 songs to date.  Additional song cycles from Darnielle's extensive repertoire include the ""Standard Bitter Love Song #..."" series, the ""Orange Ball Of..."" series, and the ""Pure..."" series, as well as a series of songs whose titles are simply chapters and verses from the Bible (""I Corinthians 13 8-10"", etc.).

&gt; Although his last six albums (since Darnielle signed with 4AD Records) have seen more hi-fi production values, most of the Mountain Goats' recorded output is extremely lo-fi, the only accompaniment to Darnielle’s razor-sharp lyrics being an acoustic guitar and the occasional input of backing vocals, and then the sound of the tape recorder permeating the track at all times, effectively serving as a backing track in its own right.

&gt; In addition to his work with The Mountain Goats, Darnielle has also collaborated with Franklin Bruno (of Nothing Painted Blue) in The Extra Glenns (later named The Extra Lens).

&gt; Darnielle’s song ""Cotton"" was featured in the Showtime show Weeds. It can be heard in the middle and at the end of the 9th episode, The Punishment Light.

&gt; The songs ""No Children,"" ""Old College Try,"" and ""Love Love Love"" were each featured in separate episodes of the television series Moral Orel's third season, which has featured major running themes of alcoholism, regret, and domestic discontent.

2705,"Honestly, yes, I do recall you being a difficult/purposefully obtuse for the purpose of starting arguments, which is why I responded rudely the first time.  

Now let's go through this thread real quick.  

The original comment I replied to said:

&gt;The USA is the largest producer of natural gas in the world and in the past ~10 years the industry has been gearing towards more international trade since the NG prices fell. It just looks very disingenuous when one of the main competitors proposes drastic sanctions on Russian gas (an industry the USA unlike Germany is not dependent at all).

Then I said:

&gt;It's not disingenuous at all, increasing LNG exports is specifically spelled out in the legislation.

I was explaining there that it cannot be disingenuous with regard to gas sales because the legislation specifically said that the purpose of the sanctions was not only to punish Russia, but to promote our gas.  It's right there, we aren't hiding anything, it's not an ulterior motive. 

So then another redditor said:

&gt;And now you know why your last sanctions on Russia is just to support your fracking industry and sell LNG.

and I replied:

&gt;No, that not the only reason, but it is a stated reason. We aren't trying to be duplicitous on this issue.

So the only issue under discussion is whether or not the US is being duplicitous, as everyone agrees that the US wants to increase LNG exports to Europe.  My position is that we are not duplicitous, because the plain language of the legislation states that it aims increase our LNG exports.  

So then you comment:

&gt;And you know that because you work in the White House? Stop acting like you are an american government official.

I mean that is completely out of left field, and why I thought there must be a reading comprehension problem.  No, I don't work in the White House, but I am capable of reading that the legislation explicitly states  that an aim of the sanctions, it's not a secret CIA plot. I haven't even stated an opinion on it, not sure why you were triggered.    

So really, I don't know what to tell you if you have read everything and understand it.

As far as your private message, I'm sorry, that's just creepy and cowardly, and no one has ever done that to me in 5+ years of redditing.  You have something to tell me, you can say it here in front of everyone.  You say I am a know it all?  I looked at your comments, you are not one to talk. The difference between you and me is that I am aware that a forum full of people arguing over policy is going to be full of ""know it alls"" and I can admit I am one of them. As for you, I don't think self awareness is your strong suit, and scolding people in private is really not cool, I'd take that one out of your repertoire.

lots of people did... mostly clash fans, and music nerds. but you bring up a good point — i was just thinking about this myself, but with röyksopp ([happy up here](http://vimeo.com/3281558)/[do that stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCOe32Fgldo)). 

i don't know...i might not always like the result, but if the artists credit the sample i guess i don't really see the problem. especially when it's the backbone to the track, like the two songs mentioned.. which they *appear* to do ([Junior](http://www.discogs.com/R%C3%B6yksopp-Junior/release/1702360)/[Kala](http://www.discogs.com/MIA-Kala/release/1046072)) — though röyksopp seems to have given writing credit, whereas M.I.A. just mentioned that track 11 ""incorporates elements of Straight To Hell by The Clash"". either way the info is there... if the listeners don't know, it's their own fault. 

that said, i think that info should be a little more apparent... because people are lazy and if they knew, upfront, how much of the song is ""borrowed"", they would probably form a slightly different opinion of the artist they claim to idolize.

2802,"It's actually possible, and one of the worst things about having ""parallel"" systems involved in ranked. League of Legends, Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, and pretty much any other game that uses the ""tiered"" rank system suffers the same problem.

Basically, you have a ""hidden"" MMR (often based on the Elo system with some variations depending upon the type of game/match you are being ranked for) that *actually* determines who you play against, that technically has no real connection to your displayed rank. So you could theoretically have an MMR that's close to the average for a high Platinum/low Diamond player while being visually displayed/ranked as a ""Gold"" player (or the reverse, have a ""low"" MMR but a high rank). Usually this is caused by winning or losing streaks, or doing really well or really poorly in placements and early on in your ranked career. LoL (and maybe some others with similar systems) also has the issue of only advancing via a best-of-3/5 series, so you can win virtually every game and still have bad luck in your promotion series and be stuck in a low rank with a high MMR/Elo.

It's a definite problem that is observed by many players on a fairly regular basis. Get on a winning streak after a losing streak and you'll run into the problem temporarily almost every time - having to play against players that are ""better"" than you in rank just to advance ahead of the other players that are ""the same"" as you in rank.",Overwatch

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

It's glamorizing an act of rich white male landowners not wanting to make any effort to find another way to potentially maintain their lifestyle than on the backs of other human beings they were keeping in crushing ignorance and poverty (white *and* black, often overlooked), and then carried off one of the greatest cons ever by convincing poor *white* Southerners to fight their war for them, on the pretext of ""protecting"" them from the invading imperialist Government, because hey -- at least they weren't *black*.

A whooooole lot of those who answered the call were immigrants from -- or children of immigrants from -- Scotland and Ireland, who had been poor tenant farmers run off their land by their landlords and/or the English to make way for more profitable sheep. So they were already leery of a strong central government which might potentially try to come in and do the same thing here.

2949,"&gt; During WWII would it be racist for a Jew to say she hated all Germans?

Yes. 

She could have said that she hated the German goverment or that she hated most Germans. But if she said that then yes, it would have been wrong. Even worse! Because other Germans could point at her and use her like ammunition saying hit like ""See this Jew? She hates us! Jews don't care about you! Jews hate everyone who is not  a Jew"" and this could cause even worse shit on all Jews for a comment like that. 

&gt;Non-white Americans feel most white Americans are racist. 

Source? But even if it were true, they are still not claiming that all white Americans are racist.

&gt;f white racists want to lump all blacks together and all Muslims together and say they are structural reasons for their behavior (the Koran is violent! blacks are predisposed to commit crime!) then there is no reason you cannot do that to white Americans.

2950,"PHOY already said some of this, but the point of making some group an ""other"" is excluding them because they're different from you, but not *too* different.

This trend would probably hold true if aliens arrived and were Hollywood-style humanoids. However, chances are that on the very slim chance that extraterrestrial life exists: 1) It cannot explore/colonize space (yet); 2) If it could explore, it could be more advanced than homo sapiens, and therefore *we* would more likely be the ""other""; and 3) We have no reason to assume that other forms of life are as intelligent as or in any way physically similar to humans.

13 years later all the wounds have long healed, people have moved a couple of times, names are hazy, most medical records are in long-term storage, most legal records at private lawyers have been destroyed, witnesses are virtually impossible to find, most corroborating evidence like communications and pictures have been destroyed, the bar will be lucky to still be in business, and both participant's memories are sketchy, at best.  I could walk into a police precinct anywhere in the country and try to file a complaint over a 13 year old assault, and I'd be largely laughed right out of there.

The crown ONLY took this to trial because it there would have been a national level explosion if they hadn't, and it says volumes about the kind of social pressure the CJS and our politicians are under to ramp up guilty findings that this even made it to a courtroom.

Any 'normal' situation, with 'normal' complainants and 'normal' defendants would have seen this filtered out by the police on the front end.

No, it isn't, what are you talking about? You just don't hear about it as much, because there are no politically motivated journalists obsessing about every single act. 

[Homicide rates](http://imgur.com/SnlrJea) show a clear increasing trend going eastward in Europe. Homicides are essentially the single crime that are fit for international comparison, which aren't heavily influenced by mundane factors such as public trust (lower willingness to report crime) or the differences in funding (leading to far lower clearance rates). If you legitimately believe that Hungary, pop. 10 million, experienced ~300 sexual assaults last year (police numbers were around that much), while Sweden with the same population had ~18.000, then...But [incarceration rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6m0d50/number_of_prisoners_per_capita_in_europe/) are an indirect way to gauge criminality as well. 

Appalachia is a popular argument which entirely neglects the rural/urban division of crime. The same number of people spread around 10 counties will naturally be less criminal than the same number of people living in a single city neighborhood. West Virginia has a population density of 29 people/km^2 . Purchasing power is naturally different as well in bumfuck-nowhere, WV and a global city like Paris, so the deprivation is greater for the urban poor. 

And yet with all that, Paris yields a [homicide rate of 2.77](http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/10/15/le-ministere-de-l-interieur-livre-enfin-les-chiffres-de-la-delinquance_4790212_4355770.html) (by far the highest in France), [peaceful redneck WV a 3.8](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state).

Something stinks.

&gt;Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity
Dear Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity,
I am deeply concerned that the Pence-Kobach commission's recent request
for private information about every voter in the country could be the
first of many attempts to push nationwide voting restrictions.
I'm glad that state election officials have put their duty to voters
above this partisan attack on voters, and I want you to know that the
American people will not be intimidated out of exercising our freedom
to vote.
The best way to uphold the integrity of our elections is by making sure
every eligible voter can vote and have their vote counted as cast --
not using false claims about illegal voting to suppress votes.
Modernizing our elections to allow things like automatic voter
registration, Election Day voter registration, and early voting are
important steps to lowering the barriers to participation for all

b) He's getting taxed at source, not because he should be paying Canadian and provincial taxes, but because the employer really hasn't dealt with a US resident working in Canada and they are mistakenly taking it at source, using his SIN.

Inside the guild housing could be a guild only auction house, food vendors similar to the carts in MoP, portals to certain areas in the world (which your guild can unlock by getting certain achievements for each zone), and perhaps even a really hard to unlock item which functions as a placeable portal location, which then anyone in the guild can use to teleport to that specific place (if it were a gold making guild, then you could put it outside an old raid or dungeon perhaps, if it's a raiding guild then it could lead to the raid, if it's a rp guild it could lead to your ideal RP location).

You could hire NPC's to obtain certain goods you have in your bag, ranging from profession goods to cooking goods all the way to augment runes, you pay the NPC's gold and they'll provide a constant stream of these materials straight into a extra guild bank slot.

You asked the following question:  ""***The thing was published in 1982 and titled ""A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s"". How much has Israel expanded since?***""

I posted a map that fairly accurately illustrates Israel's expansion of power and advantageous influence in the region. Virtually all of Israel's former enemies have effectively been neutralized, whether by bribery/corruption (US expense), by coup/""revolution"" (CIA/Mossad/Spook action) or decimated militarily - by the US and OTHER countries (see Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen).

And now Israel appears to be gearing up for a MAJOR blitzkrieg to attack Syria and [**Lebanon**](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/The-next-war-will-be-bloody-A-trip-along-Israels-tense-northern-border-498169) simultaneously - and likely make an end-run at Iran - WITH the US doing most of the fighting, dying, and PAYING for their conquest, as usual.

The only wild card is how Russia will handle this - but I think that Israel is willing to risk a LOT of lives to make their aggressive move (but not Israeli lives, of course!)

Make no mistake:  When the dust settles in Syria, Israel plans to grab a HUGE chunk of Syrian land adjacent to the Golan Heights - likely running from the border of Jordan to that of Lebanon. 

[Perhaps something like this:](http://i.imgur.com/YAPIfry.png)

Moreover, I expect that Israel will try to have a Palestinian State set up somewhere in what is now Eastern Syria or in Iraq for the purpose of ridding themselves of the Pallie Pest once and for all.

Secondly, there are so many different definitions of ""minimum wage"" in this country.  There is the federal min, then there are state min, and then there are municipal min ($15 in Seattle for example).  In some parts of the country, you are totally fucked if you make min wage, in other parts, you will be ok-ish.  In some parts of the country you will get many benefits if you are unemployed, it other parts, there are not many benefits at all.  

I'd agree that Europe takes better care of it's low paid people, but direct comparisons to the entire US is difficult, as wages/benefits are largely dictated by the states.

She needs an army? Oh, how good there is one to buy in the middle of nowhere. She does orchestrate a plan to steal this army, yes. But again: How convenient that the unsullied follow without further question the one who is carrying the whip.

She lost her dothraki? Let's get abducted, how convenient that there is this giant dothraki army. Again she DOES actually do something (although it is only burning some guys) but again: army just waiting to be taken.

She needs ships? Here are the Greyjoys. She has to bargain with them. But again, how convenient of them to show up.

I would not say she is handed everything. But the story hands her a lot of opportunities (which she actually does take - that's on her). It starts to feel like lazy writing sometimes and her cocky behaviour does not reflect how much luck (meaning the opportunites that she was given not her skills in using them) she had. That makes a lot of people (or at least me) not like her.

EDIT: Let me add one thing because people want to compare her to Jon: Jon never felt too strong to be harmed. In Danerys story I never had the feeling that there was an enemy who could seriously harm her (now that she has come to Westeros that is starting to change). Jon was killed, Jon almost lost the battle against the Boltons. He feels less overpowered.

I remember the moment when the Stark-banners were put on Winterfell after the battle of the bastards. For a second I thought it wouldn’t be the wolf of house stark but Littlefinger’s bird because he actually had the strongest army at that point and could have taken Winterfell easily. In Danery’s case I just would have thought ‘whatever, if someone tried to do something like that to her, she’d just burn them and take their army - because people tend to follow her when she burns their leader.”

What kinds of rewards are in the Honor capsules?

The minimum loot in an Honor Capsule is two key fragments. There's a chance to get more key fragments, and there's a high rate of champ shards, too. At the top end, there's a rare shot at the Honor-exclusive skins, Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick. If you nab the skins, they unlock for free, and you'll get the champ if you don't already own them.

How do I get Honor Capsules?

There's no alternative and you know it. We will talk about abstention after the referendum, not before!

- Yes wins, you end up with a heavy division in society
- No wins, you end up with a heavy division in society.

I suggest watching one of your replays and paying attention to your mid-game and late-game macro movements. Are you ever caught alone warding? Killing minions in side lane? Too far from the start of a teamfight? Those are the most impactful, game-losing mistakes players make at your elo. Especially because if you get caught, either 1. teammates jump in to save you and they get caught as well leading to a snowball effect 2. your team 4v5's because it's just irresistible at that elo

I personally believe if your macro is good enough you can lose lane and still win the game most of the time, but a laning tip is to keep track of minion aggro. Caster minions deal a ton of damage if you let them shell away at you. Dodge into the brush to de-aggro casters.

When I was homeless I was given an old second gen iPhone as a donation. I didnt pay a monthly plan, I just used wifi so I didnt pay anything, so no my donations weren't going towards phone upkeep. But a phone is completely necessary and not a luxury because pay phones don't exist anymore in most cities--how does a homeless person contact the police if they are faced with trouble?

And for the record, you may be right that certain business owners not want in you to charge your phone outside, but those business owners very likely wouldn't allow a homeless person to be panhandling outside in the first place. 

In my experience business owners who don't mind you hanging around also don't at all mind you using their outlet a few hours a day. Besides, over the course of a year it costs about 25 cents total to charge a phone. What a burden on the business. Not like a business owner who is sympathetic to the homeless would ever throw 25 cents to a homeless person. 

I'm not saying that when I was homeless I didn't care, but that you know what places are feasible places to panhandle and which ones aren't. If a business owner had ever asked me to leave or unplug, I would, that's no question. ",funny

2.So you admit to the fact that his citizenship was not revoked? Good because that's a point I'm trying to make.

3.If it really only applies to the Canadian involvement then my point still stands as to why trudeau had his hands tied...Also again gitmo violates rights on a daily basis.

4.You dont get to assume that he would release the legal opinion...And that doesn't mean he paid omar because he wanted to. 

5.The issue here is that Stephen Harper shouldn't have let omar be put into gitmo with its reputation...This is a Canadian citizen we are talking about and he should have seen what was going to happen...This was a kid we are talking about.In addition why did it take so long for him to be transfered to a Canadian prison? None of this likely would have went down if it wasn't in gitmo.

6.No there aren't two different sets of laws...Omar is a Canadian citizen, Stop dancing around that fact.

7.You know nothing about the U.S. friendly fire cases on Canadian soldiers...There is a point in the military where friendly fire must be held accountable to the soldier who committed it...That point, For pilots at least, Is when they don't wait to verify a target...That is 100% against standard procedure and you can see why and it is about as close as you can get to murder with intent.Which is why the military cracks down on it so hard. and takes verification very seriously especially regarding the air force which has a huge friendly fire record. 

8.The thing about being in NATO...You don't have to commit to everything the organization decides to do.

It's called a commitment to NATO, Not an obligation to NATO...But of course you don't know that. 

9.Correction, One of our citizens who became an insurgent by force killed one of their soldiers at the age of 15 in a war that is questionable in the first place...But keep trying to simplify it in a way with as minimal details as possible to suit your own argument.

I justifies not upholding a law suit by informing you what likely could have happened...Apparently I'm the one who doesn't know judicial enforcement even though you're the one who doesn't know how far a law suit can go.

&gt; Anamanaguchi is a four-piece band from New York City that makes emotional punk, pop, &amp; dance music using hacked Nintendos, Game Boys, and 16-bit soundscapes. Members include Peter Berkman (guitar, songwriting), Ary Warnaar (guitar, songwriting), James DeVito (bass, stage visuals engineer), and Luke Silas (drums, solo act 'knife city'). A member of the artist collective 8bitpeoples, Peter Berkman had been creating chiptune music since 2003. Their debut album, 'Power Supply' EP, was released in 2006 as a free download. The name ""Anamanaguchi"" came about from the members' internships at Armani (Berkman and DeVito), Prada (Warnaar), and Gucci (Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design.

&gt; On March 3, 2009 they released their first full-length album, 'Dawn Metropolis', featuring 7 songs that pushed the chiptune-rock formula to a new level and included a website full of visual landscapes for the tracks. The following Summer the band began releasing free downloadable ""summer singles"" on their website: 'Airbrushed', 'My Skateboard Will Go On', Aurora (Meet me in the Stars)', and 'Mess'. The band was later commissioned by Universal &amp; Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to create 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game (Original Videogame Soundtrack)' to coincide with the movie of the same title.

&gt; In 2013, Anamanaguchi released their first live action music video featuring a new single MEOW. During a hugely successful Kickstarter Campaign with the promise of making it ""more than just an album"", the band released 'Endless Fantasy', a 22-track full-length album under their own record label, 'dream.hax'. Setting the stage for a new era in Guch history, the band reaches the far ends of the galaxy with its sound and has no sign of slowing down here on spaceship earth! ( n_n)b

- Why is Megatron himself (but with a new look) again? He was Galvatron in AoE, made out of ""Transformium"". Not that he played any significant role in this movie anyway...shame  
- Why can B suddenly speak? His voice box was still broken, he even ripped the one he got in the movie out, because it wasn't his voice.  
- Introducing Unicron and not explaining anything...yay.  
- Introducing the Creator and not explaining anything...yay.  
- Why is Cybertron a broken mess in deep space? Didn't they bring it to Earth in DotM? What happened to it anyway during AoE? Was it sucked back? Why does Prime not remember his homeworld being destroyed? He sounds confused and surprised, but he should know. I mean, he was THERE, ffs!  
- How much fucking time has passed, until Prime landed on Cybertron? He flew aimlessly, frozen, through space. Cybertron is supposeduly millions of light years away? And then suddenly it's back into Earth's atmosphere 3 days later???  
- They killed off the fucking moon. Earth is fucked? I mean, don't tell me, an alien planet ravagin the Moon and Earth won't have any lasting effects?  
- What about the Dinobots? Will Grimlock and the others, who aren't just mindless beasts, ever speak?  
- Where did the baby Dinobots come from?!  
- Where did the Knight in the destroyed city come from? Why was he in a Cybertronian attack craft (assuming that's what it is)?  
- What was the purpose of that stupid girl, apart from apparently having her weird robot body saving the day?  
- Why, ffs, are we getting more and more Transformers, who have been on Earth for like ever, but almost everyone was oblivious to their existence in the first movie? Like that butler dude.  
- Barricade is back...yay. Still not really talkative. Let's just bring everyone back from the dead or mortally wounded.  
- B can now apparently split up and remerge with some sort of electromagnetism? How? Why?  
- What was the point of Megatron's ""death squad""?  
- Why did they opt for ""Infernicus"", instead of introducing ""Bruticus"" and actually making him/them badass for once?!  
- Why the fuck do the Decepticons never finish the job? Megatron shot Hound almost point blank, but an hour later the damn fatty is back in action like nothing ever happened?  
- And finally, since I'm running out of things to say before my head explodes, how often are we gonna keep seing Prime ""kill"" (defeat) Megatron? Give that villain and all bots some character for once and not just 1 or 2 lines in the entire movie. You have the Cybertron games, you have several animated series. Use that shit!",movies

3730,why did you use a question mark right after an ellipsis ,leagueoflegends
3731,"This narrative is patently false.

Brady took bottom-5 defenses to the AFCCG three years in a row (and the SB once).

Brady has also faced *much* stiffer competition in the playoffs, while Manning annually padded his stats by crushing WC opponents. Brady has also won the AFCCG more than Manning has been to it (Brady is 7-3 while Manning is 4-1; so Brady has won the SB as often as Manning has won the divisional round). Getting to rack up a ton of WC games and get knocked out of the playoffs early most years pads your playoff stats. 

Sure Brady wasn't super human *every single game* but that isn't realistic to expect. You also pointed out the Ravens and Texans, who both have exceptional defenses; Manning never played the Texans and sucked against the post-season Ravens as well. 

Also, Brady wasn't exceptional in the one Colts game, but he murders them almost every time they meet so not sure what you're outlier is supposed to prove. The Chargers games he played poorly, but not terribly; he put together a 9-minute drive to seal the victory in one, and in the other he led two 4Q scoring drives to take the lead and seal the win.

He has 7 more playoff games than Manning, yet has 6 more games with &gt;100 passer rating (12 to Peyton's 6). If Manning did play those 7 extra games, he would need 23 TDs but only 5 INTs to match Brady's numbers. The INTs he could probably do, but that's at least 3 TDs every game, a feat he only accomplished in 6 of his 27 playoff games (2 WC, 3 Div, 1 AFCCG).

Plus let's not forget that half of Peyton's two rings come from being literally dragged by an all-time great defense. Brady may have had more years with a top defense, but he never had a defense like Peyton did in 2015. Similarly, Manning had five top-10 defenses that he couldn't get to the AFCCG. Brady had one.

Lastly, stats like ""Manning was 2-3 when his D gave up 30 or more points"" are intentionally misleading.

QB|Year|Opp.|Score
:|:|:|:
Manning|2002|Jets|0-41
Manning|2009|Saints|17-31
Manning|2014|Seahawks|8-43
Manning|2013|Ravens|35-38
Manning|2007|Patriots|38-34
Manning|2003|Chiefs|38-31
Brady|2009|Ravens|14-33
Brady|2007|Colts|34-38
Brady|2014|Ravens|35-31

So first of all, Peyton is 2-4 and 3 of the losses were blowouts where he couldn't do shit on offense. This comparison also ""double counts"" the Pats-Colts game in which Peyton just *barely* outscored Brady.

Brady is also 2-0 in the Super Bowl when his team gives up 28 or more points; Manning is 0-2.

Manning has led his offense to 20 or fewer points fourteen times in the playoffs (fifteen, actually -- 7 of the 24 SBL points came from Von Miller); Brady has done this only ten times -- despite playing 7 more games.",nfl

As for the super crazy weapon, I'm going to guess that in order to fulfill his plan, he needs something as potent as Bahamut as a reason for working together, and this is his card without actually having to summon Bahamut.

Surely there would have been a ton of talent, right, as the majority of the players in the NALCS were actually from NA. However, that really wasn't the case. Players like CruzerTheBruzer and Nyjacky were starters because there wasn't enough talent. The midlaner from a random LPL team comes to NA and easily becomes top 3 in NA, keeping in mind the one of the other top 3 mids is from EU. So yeah, a few years ago there was definitely a lack of talent, and that's where this idea that NA lacks talent has come from.

I am now trying to quit again. In the past two weeks, I have only drank two times. Both times I measured out 8oz bourbon in a measuring cup and stopped when it was gone. Typically, I would drink twice that much on a daily basis. To stave off the depression, I have changed my eating habits and started logging every calorie; I run on the treadmill 30 minutes a day, even if I have to force myself to do it; and I have started drinking tons of water and coffee, neither of which I bothered drinking before (water was always just a mixer).

He has so many reasons to be inducted that I won't even start listing and instead I'll just go straight for the major knock against him which is that he only did so good because he was playing for a good team, which is complete and utter bullshit. First, he also played for the Islanders and the Blues and still had a winning record with those teams. Look at what's happened to those teams since he played for them. Basically right into the crapper (not trying to knock you Islanders and Blues fans, just pointing out facts).

You may say that doesn't matter much because he played much more time for the Wings. To that I say you still have to play like a champion if you want to become one. Look as recently as last year and you can find plenty of examples. Luongo is one of the best goalies in the league and played for the President's Trophy winners, but god was he bad on the road in the playoffs. Bryzgalov, another excellent goalie, let in 4 or more goals every game in the playoffs this year and played for a pretty solid club. Point being, you don't just win because you're on a good team and even if you've done well in the past, it doesn't guarantee you'll win today. You have to go out and earn every win no matter who you play for or what your reputation is. That's what Osgood did.

The fact that he did it for so long and at such a high level while becoming a champion three times along the way proves it to me that he should be in the Hall of Fame.",hockey

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre#Starvation_in_Srebrenica_1992.E2.80.931995

Starvation in Srebrenica 1992–1995

A former Serb soldier of the ""Red Berets"" unit described the tactics used to starve and kill the besieged population of Srebrenica:

*It was almost like a game, a cat-and-mouse hunt. But of course we greatly outnumbered the Muslims, so in almost all cases, we were the hunters and they were the prey. We needed them to surrender, but how do you get someone to surrender in a war like this? You starve them to death. So very quickly we realised that it wasn't really weapons being smuggled into Srebrenica that we should worry about, but food. They were truly starving in there, so they would send people out to steal cattle or gather crops, and our job was to find and kill them... No prisoners. Well, yes, if we thought they had useful information, we might keep them alive until we got it out of them, but in the end, no prisoners... The local people became quite indignant, so sometimes we would keep someone alive to hand over to them [to kill] just to keep them happy.*[40]

When Australian journalist Tony Birtley visited the besieged Srebrenica in March 1993, he took footage of Bosniak civilians starving to death.[41]

The judgment of the Hague Tribunal in the case of Naser Oric found that:

*Bosnian Serb forces controlling the access roads were not allowing international humanitarian aid—most importantly, food and medicine—to reach Srebrenica. As a consequence, there was a constant and serious shortage of food causing starvation to peak in the winter of 1992/1993. Numerous people died or were in an extremely emaciated state due to malnutrition. Bosnian Muslim fighters and their families, however, were provided with food rations from existing storage facilities. The most disadvantaged group among the Bosnian Muslims was that of the refugees, who usually lived on the streets and without shelter, in freezing temperatures. Only in November and December 1992, did two UN convoys with humanitarian aid reach the enclave, and this despite Bosnian Serb obstruction.*[42]

3952,"&gt;My point is, that if these new immigrants do change Canada drastically, why should they not be allowed to? They would be doing nothing more than what has been done previously.

I am all for immigrants to Canada bringing elements of their culture and sharing it with everyone. Food, music, dance, whatever. That is one of the positives about Canada's multicultural population. I encourage people to be open and embrace things they have never experienced before.

&gt;If you must defend current ""Canadian values"" against this immigration, what gives you the right to? Keeping in consideration, of how this country came into being how it is.

What I've been to alluding to in other comments is that Canada has basically been created as a modern day, first world country by a MAJORITY (not completely, I realize this) of Western European settlers. They were the ones who laid down the groundwork to allow this country to exist how it currently does, and in my opinion, we are in pretty good standing as far as other countries go. Allowing people to come here and not at LEAST learn English/French, and refuse to acknowledge the fact that ""traditional"" Canada is very similar to the US/UK (with the culture/traditions/values that comes with that) is undermining what made Canada into what it is today.

I like some metal. It's probably my third most listened to genre. I also recognize that it's a small subsection of what metal encompasses. 

I find a vast majority of metal to be a pissing contest rather than an actual expression of music. So much of metal is filled with how intense and how extreme can you go rather than trying to create actual harmonious sounds. 

Allot of it comes down to how I define music. To me music needs a play between building tension and relieving tension and, *much like bad dubstep*, allot of metal is built around constantly increasing tension. It's exhausting to listen to metal because it doesn't breathe well. It's always screaming at the top of it's lungs trying to belt out the sounds of a hellmouth. 

Call me old-school but I haven't found a band that plays modern metal to anywhere near the same level of emotional impact as the guys who've been around since before like 97.

There will be very few people that argue that Brady had better weapons 2007 - 2015. 2013 Brady lost Welker and Hernandez, Amendola got hurt, Gronk went down, and they will went to the AFCCG. Imagine if Manning lost his top receiver, his 3rd receiver, and then midseason lost his number 1 and 2 receiving options.

Brady has gone from Spread to 2TE to 3WR to losing receivers year in and year out, and he is routinely the QB of a top 3 offense.

There's one point I do want to get at, though: If it's a normal game, and it looks really bad, and 3 of your team just want to surrender and move on to the next game, PLEASE agree to it. Because not doing it probably makes the experience worse for 3 people in your team. I do understand that games can be turned around, and I do understand that you won't want to surr on the first or the second vote, maybe not even after that. But at some point shouldn't it be better for you and your team to just move on to the next game or take a break after you lost another teamfight/objective? That's what the function is for imho - a lost game that doesn't turn around the first few tf tries likely won't do so on the next one, especially not with one or more tilted players on your team.

You don't want to surrender rankeds, fine by me. I disagree that you should never surrender ranked, but I get *and* I accept that attitude, which is why I never talk back at anyone not surrendering a ranked.

But please consider this: What good does a victory in one of those normal games do you when your team is tilted and just wants to take a break? (EDIT to clarify: Especially in comparison to the games that you won't turn around)

One more thing to OP: 
&gt; You dont wanna play anymore, no stress. Just go afk and the system will take care of you :).

F\*ck you for that one. When I'm tilted and don't wanna play anymore I'll say so, and you can accept it or not accept it, but giving teammates incentive to break the rules and get themselves punished when they are already tilted is just sh\*tty behaviour, no exceptions.",leagueoflegends

For non-RPers on a RP realm, they even find the RPers nice to have because it makes the server feel like it has more substance.

It has nothing at all to do with lying and everything to do with the legal definition and interpretation of events differing from the personal definitions of a biased actor involved in those events. Think of waterboarding, and how the Bush government lobbied that it wasn't torture, but the UN and US courts ultimately ruled it was, as an example. The Bush administration legal opinion ultimately didn't mean much.

&gt; Irrelevant. We're talking about his conviction and confession - which he agreed to with his plea deal outside of Gitmo.

It's not irrelevant at all.  He had to agree to that plea deal to even get OUT of Gitmo, and his treatment while at that facility most definitely informs and motivates his plea as a result.  Anyway, what you and I say here really means shit.  It's all going to come down to a US judge in a US courtroom, and to date those cases haven't gone the way of the US government very often.

One MILITARY judge, based out of Guantanamo Bay, using the Military Commissions Act as his body of law, sure, but part of the contention in the appeal is that the standard of justice in the tribunals was insufficient and ultimately unfair, prompting him to plead just to get away from that unfair body of law and that detention.

At this point it is starting to get to the point that an independent arbitrator should handle the Arab-Israeli dispute. America and Europe have vested interests. India is unlikely to sympathies with the Muslim Arabs. Perhaps the Japs or Mexicans could play a bigger role in persuading the two sides to cooperate.

Using a bare trust to avoid property transfer tax will be closed. The sub-prime mortgage scheme will be halted. The foreign-buyer tax could be doubled to 30 per cent and implemented province-wide. Closing these loopholes and taxing non-resident ownership is in the public interest.

This may shift the market, but Australia tried similar things in 2015, and the market only accelerated there.

Like in Aus., the dollar is still pretty low.  Rates are still pretty low.  The number of international students will be high.  And free trade is just starting.

[New visa rules will take China-Canada relations to a new level](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/new-visa-rules-will-take-china-canada-relations-to-a-new-level/article23354909/)

&gt; With this arrangement, visa offices in China and Canada will issue to citizens – for business travel, tourism or family visits – multiple-entry visas that are valid for up to 10 years, but not exceeding validity of applicant’s passport. Each stay may not exceed 180 days.

&gt;This arrangement is another remarkable achievement in the development of bilateral relations between China and Canada.

&gt;When Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited China last November, a broad consensus was achieved regarding politics, the economy and people-to-people exchanges. 

Australia has something similar.  It's clear that western trade with China isn't going away any time soon.  Parties say that they want it to slow down, but the reality is they all want it to pick up.  Why?  Duh... Money.  *Money, money, money, money, money.*

fwiw, Canadians can also travel quite freely to China as well, as part of the agreement.

There are more factors than just the Chinese when it comes to BC real estate, but I wouldn't expect these rules changes to force a collapse of any sort.  Perhaps a further slowing-down.  The rate of growth in past years was quite unsustainable.",canada

The protocol includes the need for preserving anonymity, voters being able to verify after the fact that their vote was counted and was tabulated accurately. It doesn't cover (or at least my implementation didn't) verifying the box was empty - the intent being that the system would ensure that by tabulating how many ballots were issued, how many were not cast and doing the appropriate math.

In the [diffusion of innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) theory the first groups of early adopters are willing to take the risk and in this case it also means proprietary charging stations and standards (I think Tesla's are not part of some open standard) that might become obsolete once electric cars get adopted more widely.

If the government were to become irredeemably corrupt, all of the amendments would become moot - the entire constitution would - and the threat of force from the government would be final statement in any debate. The amendments all deal with property and behavior, but the property (and behavior, depending on how you read it) which the 2nd amendment protects gives the people the additional ability to defend against force.

If the government decides to quarter troops in your house (in violation of the third amendment) you can protest using the first amendment, but when they point their guns at you, they have effectively nullified your first and third amendment rights. When they choose to imprison you without a trial and take your stuff, they have effectively removed your 4th and 5th and 6th amendment rights. Throughout the entire scenario, if you cannot bring force to bear to stop them, then the rights never really existed.

The best way to break the trap in my opinion is to send a guy for a stretch pass behind the ""3"" going cross-ice over the blue to the strong side. This, if you're playing a good opponent, will force his man to either stay with him or force a D man up. *Then*, you soft dump behind the strong side D. This does two things: 1) forces that strong side D to have to turn his feet and try to beat out the forechecker (who used to be the guy going for the stretch pass), and 2) if they're well coached, the weak side D should go retrieve the puck for the strong side D, which causes the middle of the ice to be open for a short time before the strong side can recover to the back post. This also makes it so the opposing center either goes to help the D or picks up a man driving to the net. As the forwards, once that dump goes in and your first guy goes to beat the D to the puck he'll have three options: 1) continue the rim around to a weak side forechecker, 2) hit the guy driving the middle of the ice that the strong side D is now forced to cover, or 3) if he won the race to the puck to carry it behind the net and find the trailer or hit a late arriving Dman for a shot, because remember now the trap has everybody's feet down ice instead of watching the play. The trap is good. But it is easily beatable with speed and efficient forechecking. This is because the trap is passive and the opponents feet are usually flat relative to the forechecking team.",hockey

4565,"Because the separate category is protecting the women, not hurting them. If you want to end gender segregation in sports, that means allowing the women to compete with the men and allowing the men to compete with the women. Barcelona are an absolutely amazingly skilled team. They are also professional athletes in tip top shape. Messi is disturbingly fast and strong. Just because someone is short doesn't mean they aren't strong or fast. Men also have larger lungs in proportion to their bodies. So they can run faster and for longer periods of time. If you allowed the Barcelona B team to try out for the women's world cup team, they would replace all of the women players and there would be no women left. How can you allow women to compete in men's leagues and not allow men to compete in women's leagues if you're being equal? Like you said, on average men would be stronger, faster, have higher endurance, etc. And the strongest, best women would still only have the physical potential of the average men; the best, strongest men would be beyond them. Would you rather have women's leagues and men's leagues (gender segregation), or a large men's league with a tiny number of women's players who are born as genetic exceptions with extraordinary physical might and talent and might sometimes get to play (gender equality)?

Also, even skill in sports is physical. For instance, in football skill is how well a player has trained their small muscle groups. Dribbling requires use of leg muscles, kicking the ball requires muscles, using light touches requires muscles, doing moves requires muscles, etc. Men have denser muscle fiber, so their muscle groups that control these functions can act quicker, stronger, and for longer periods of time. In other words, they can do faster and stronger moves, touches, passes, etc. for longer periods of time with more consistency, which is really important in a 90 minute game without timeouts. I still don't understand why you think Messi is not strong or fast; he is a beast. He is crazy fast, and have you seen how hard his shots are? His legs are super strong.",soccer

Cristiano Ronaldo also IS aging, he's adapting his play, he's visibly in great shape, he's doing it really great and he's great, he shines in many big moments etc., but if you look at output throughout whole season, I don't think Real fans would argue it's showing he's past 30 - compared to his play earlier.

4576,"Here's the problem with this Sirius-orbit idea...

Let me introduce you to Alpha Centauri. There are three main bodies in this star system: A, B, and C. (There may be others in a loose relationship but my point only depends on these three anyway.) Alpha Centauri A and B are quite close to each other, but C (also known as ""Proxima Centauri"") is 0.21 light years away from A/B, although it is known to orbit them.

Now, that's *one fifth* of a light year. How long do you think the orbital period is, for this distance? I'll tell you: [it's 550,000 years. Over half a *million* years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri)

So at a distance of 0.21 light years, the period is half a million years. That's just physics. The greater the distance, the longer the period.

So there is absolutely zero chance that Sirius, which is *over 8 light years away* from our solar system, could be in an orbital motion with our sun at around a 24,000 year period. 

If anything is in gravitational orbit with our sun, with period around the same time as the precession of the equinoxes, it would need to be less than 0.02 light years away. Here's [Comet McNaught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2006_P1), at *maximum* 0.0648 light-years away, and has an orbit of 92,000 years.

So people need to get off this Sirius idea. If there's a huge body in orbit with the sun on the scale of 25 thousand years' period, it's gotta be much closer than any star we currently know, and therefore a very dark body since we haven't seen it since telescopes were invented.

I am fascinated by the possibilities of ancient earthlings knowing more about the precession of the equinoxes than we currently give credit for, and if such knowledge can be found coded and handed down in an occulted manner, all the more breath-taking and jaw-dropping... But, still possible.

But Sirius being in orbit with the Sun? Not possible, and it tarnishes the veracity of any of these long-cycle ideas every time it gets brought up. ",conspiracy

Only a couple of absolute disappointments in Hand Shakers and ClassicaLoid, plus one letdown from Chaos;Child. The top of the rankings was stacked with Rakugo 2, Kuzu no Honkai, and Demi-chan, with Maid Dragon and Onihei coming in at the next tier. ACCA was a pleasant surprise, and I seem to be one of the bare handful that didn't hate Seiren around these parts. Minami-kei was cute fun, though it kinda fizzled there at the end. Add in Youjo Senki and the start of LWA plus the second cours of 3-gatsu and Iron-blooded Orphans and to a lesser extent All Out!!, and I was one happy marine mammal for that 3-month span as I handed out five 9/10s. That's the most 9/10s that a single season has gotten from me since Summer 2015, and I was astonished at the sheer amount of quality titles that aired.

Spring, on the other hand, was much more of a letdown. Renai Boukun was a disaster to the point where I was comparing it to the garbage pile known as Kemeko Deluxe!, and Sin: Nanatsu no Tansai is just a hentai with a richer plot than usual. Kabuki-bu and Hinako Note were overall mediocre at best. Atom The Beginning was promising, but fell flat. Sakura Quest is struggling more than a small town. Sakurada Reset and Fukumenkai Noise had starts that were incredibly awkward, but turned around later in the season. LWA kept being LWA. BnHA2 and AoT2 weren't as hype for me as the rest of the crowd, with Titan feeling like it was more of a background season and Hero taking far too much time with the tournament arc for my taste. (Then again, I'm not fond of tournament arcs in the first place.) Kado, Saekano Flat, and SukaSuka were quality enough, but still not amazing.

We don't allow movie reviews in the titles of submissions, and nearly all of the user-submissions of RT come with ""XYZ movie is at XX% on Rotten Tomatoes!!"" 2) RT fluctuates everyday, it's not a stable system of reliable reviews. 3) Most of the RT submissions result in the users spending the whole time just arguing about the validity of quantifying movie reviews. If your submission falls outside of these categories, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmovies) and we'll put this submission back. Thanks for your patience.

4659,"Unfortunately, GA is standard for build on ADCs at the moment, and has been since the change.

Which is kinda a huge handicap on adcs and I'd really prefer for adcs to be empowered to build more damage than we are right now.

Back in season 5, a normal build could get anywhere from 380-450 ad depending on the final item (scimitar, bork, second zeal, ga, banshees).

Now, adcs are barely breaking 340 ad with necessary GA and LW purchases that don't even notably increase damage vs squishies, inf is often dropped for er, both give less ad than before, and scimitar gives less ad and often doesn't fit in builds.

BUT IT'S OK, we have less overall attack speed and 70-80% crit with only three crit items (vs 90 before, also this is dropping below 300 total ad *and* completely skipping out on built lifesteal, unless you're willing to sell boots, which is riskier and riskier in higher elo, and is akin to skipping GA atm.)

At least we have 50% crit with two instead of 40 from old Shiv+Inf. Also, shit's cheaper, and keystones add some missing lifesteal/movespeed/ad. Only thing we objectively have more of is movespeed tbh, the warlord's lifesteal is worse than just having 20-30% lifesteal, and fervor's ad does balance out some of the missing ad from older builds but is locked behind a stacking mechanic.

RP are bought in the shop with real money. You can buy champions, skins, IP and EXP boosts with it.  
IP are gained by playing matches. You can buy champions and runes with it.  

Runes give your champion ingame-stats (like attack damage, ability damage, armor, ...etc). You equip runes into runepages out of game; you can select different pages in champion selection (but not alter them; you have to do it before you queue up).

**Save your IP!** Do not spend it immediately at early levels. You probably will regret later how you spent them.

If you want to invest real money, you should probably buy champions (characters) with those RP, because it will ""unlock"" more of the game for you and they can be quiet expensive when bought with IP.  
You want to spend your IP on runes, because those can be crucial for specific play styles / strategies (e.g. you need correct runes to clear when jungling; it's easier to last hit minions for gold early on with attack damage runes equiped).
Since you can buy the good runes from level 20 onwards, don't bother with them now (even though the ealry level runes only cost 1IP, so... maybe get them... it's like 1 game for all of them ;D )

What about when enough pissed off civilians form a well-sized militia and have guns? People will die. They won't likely win, hardly. But people on both sides will die, more civilians than anything.

And that's what makes the difference, that you're forcing them to kill thousands of people who feel very strongly that something the government doing is dead wrong. It's enough to make the police and military question whether subjugation is the right answer. It's enough to convince people to compromise rather than enter a gun fight. It proves a point, that you won't push people around without a fight, a *real* fight.

That's why I still support it. Not because we will ever beat the government, but just so that we can fight it if it ever came to that point, just so we can prove that we believe that things are so wrong that we are willing to die for it and that might be the difference that matters.

In the same season, Leeds generated £81.5m, with a net loss of £34m, and against a total debt of £82m. They'd been taking out short term loans and failing to meet expectations on the field (that season they took out a £60m loan whilst missing CL revenue) and very quickly got into a position where they couldn't meet their loan repayments.

Two Scenarios:

1) Jazz keep Hayward, lose Hill, gain Rubio. I don't know much about their other assets, young players etc but lets say best case scenario Exum improves a bit and Favors stays healthy. Everything else stays the same. As a team how much better are the Jazz than last year? Not much IMO especially considering the West just got even tougher with Minnesota, Denver, OKC, and Houston improving. Spurs are still the Spurs. Same with GSW.

2) Hayward goes to Boston. If Boston was already as good as Utah without Hayward aren't they significantly better than Utah with Hayward (comparing them to Utah with Hayward still). On top of that they got Tatum. Plus Jaylen Brown improving.

This goes back to my point about NA viewing things exclusively in extremes, instead of actually looking at the reality of the situation. So read that again. It's like saying that you either support anarchism or communism in politics (2 opposites). I'm tired of trying to make it more obvious than it already is that NA relies heavily on their imports, while also having more, than EU does. That matters without a doubt. 

Stop trying to tell me what we're talking about, it's what you're talking about. 

Who said they had to be 100% full of natives? Stop acting like they're only 2 extreme opposites again. 

EU has 9 imports, while NA has 18. How on earth are you NA fans once again telling me that EU and NA are the same in one more regard, when it's clearly not the case. Add that onto the importance of imports for both regions, and it's even more loopsided. 

Now add onto that the fact that there is twice as many Europeans at Rift Rivals, and it's all supporting my stance. 

Fnatic is the strongest team for Europe, and it has no imports. Every NA team has imports at rift rivals. 

There is layers upon layers of evidence supporting my claim. 

If you can't deal with that, then that's too bad, but it doesn't change it, no matter how much you want it to be different. I cba to try and explain this to you any further.

One thing that is important to mention is the fact that you probably don’t want to mention jury nullification until you are selected as a juror, that is likely to get you dismissed immediately.

&gt; Although not officially members of the band, Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees performed vocals on I'm Above and Long Gone Day, and Skerik of Critters Buggin, Les Claypool's Fancy Band and The Meters (among others) performed saxophone on Long Gone Day.

&gt; Two of the band's members have since passed away. Layne Staley (of Alice In Chains) died of an overdose of cocaine and heroin (A.K.A. a 'speedball') in April of 2002 and bassist John Baker Saunders died of a Heroin overdose in 1999.

&gt; A deluxe edition of Above including previously unreleased tracks from the band's unfinished second album with new lyrics and vocals by Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age) is released in 2013.

&gt; The band consisted of:
Layne Staley (Alice in Chains) - vocals, guitar
Mike McCready (Pearl Jam) - lead guitar
John Baker Saunders (The Walkabouts) -  bass
Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees) - drums and percussion Read more on Last.fm.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

5210,"So what exactly is the problem here?

&gt;And it doesn’t really help us, it’s helping other countries. And I don’t think those other countries appreciate what we’re doing.

It's in the context, that despite NATO is helping mainly other countries than USA, which is true because USA out of all countries can defend themselves, those other countries ""don't appreciate"" what USA is doing, which is true.

It doesn't mean that Trump wants to leave NATO or sth.

&gt;I think NATO may be obsolete. NATO was set up a long time ago — many, many years ago when things were different. Things are different now.

NATO may be obsolete because it wasn't created to fight against terrorism, which is issue #1 nowadays. Trump was proposing expanding the purpose of NATO, which is a good thing IMO&gt;

5212,"A huge problem with the ""difference"" is that it is not officially recognized anywhere. Go look up sex/gender in the dictionary. They're marked as synonyms and usually share he definition of each other. Gender identity is a new concept that people are pushing and just calling it ""gender"" confuses people. You can't change the meaning of a word so easily.

If people want gender identity to be a thing, it needs its own original word. You can't try to change ""gender"" into a new word. It's always been the g-rated version of ""sex"".

My personal feelings are that the concept is misguided. Humans like putting things into categories. Gender identity is just... more categorizing. We don't need to label ourselves constantly with more and more descriptions and adjectives and labels. Why can't we just be ourselves without making up and wearing labels that describe who we are.

5229,"I don't think the difference on defense is that great compared to when they won the conference two years ago. Here's how they compare, you can include Russell for 15-16 if you want, but they only really had him for a handful of games when they already had a playoff spot locked up.

Methot - Klingberg

Lindell - Johns

Hamhuis - Pateryn

vs

Goligoski - Klingberg

Oduya - Demers

Benn - Jokipakka

So first difference is Methot vs Goligoski. Two totally different players, and while Goligoski is/was the better player, I think Methot's playstyle compliments Klingberg's better. Having a stay at home guy to let Klingberg go on his adventures rather than another offensive minded, mistake prone guy could be a huge benefit for Dallas, we'll have to find out.

Everything else is pretty even. Demers is a pretty big loss from the 15-16 team, and I don't think he has a direct replacement right now, but I think everybody else is relatively even in ability across the two defenses. So if the second defense can lead them to a conference title with Lehtonen/Niemi backing them up, what can a similar defense in the first do with Bishop backing them up? We'll have to see, but I think a similar defense with a much better goalie spells success in Dallas.

If we're talking physical capability, there's all sorts of incidents with firearms where even toddlers managed to kill people by accident, or where adult dependents with legal guardians kill people in anger or by accident.  What they CAN do is not what they are legally culpable for.

Who pays the judgement if a 15 year old steals the family car and runs someone down?  Mom and Dad.

And Speers' widow already had a judgement in the bank against Khadr's father.  She argued in the first case that the father was culpable, and the second case that the son was culpable. She was trying to get money via both directions.

Just because religious groups are kind of slimy in their reporting of adherents, that doesn't mean it makes sense for a parent to be able to vote for their child.

The difference isn't in the domain of political clout, but in the domain of childhood development. Some people believe that religion is an important part of a child's development, while others believe it is detrimental to the child. Children themselves cannot choose whether they want to be religious or not until they reach a certain age, and defaulting to no religion *is* a choice.

How many people, if raised in the absence of religion (not on the fringe of religion while being told it is bad), would go on to choose it, barring a major traumatic experience?

Further, how do you regulate what parents are allowed to teach to children? What beliefs need to be held back until the child can choose for themself? Parents are going to pass certain beliefs onto their children. Those children can later reassess those beliefs to see if they agree with them.

I remember during big football events it would become a short-term habit for me to turn on the TV every day at the same time and watch high quality football.

Similar happened with this major but it was much too short. I only had like 3 days of habit worthy watching. Then it started to be a bit messy and then the finals came and buh bye major. 

1 major per year, massive pool, lasts for at least 2 weeks. It's a win-win. 

There's enough space between each major for you to really develop a thirst for it. 

It's only one major so if the hosts fuck up THEY DON'T GET another CHANCE. Imagine if PGL was the only major of the year and 50% of the time we should be spending watching we were bored to death because of endless problems. They would never get the major again.

5331,"The problem is that the French and British formed part of a common force, they did not fight separately. The troops cut off at Dunkirk were both French &amp; English. If you look at information for the battle of Dunkirk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk), you will see about 400,000 troops on the Franco-British side, all under command of the Supreme Commander of allied forces, Frenchman Maxime Weygand. About 338K were rescued, the rest were casualties. Of these 338K, 100K were French and evacuated aswell. Thats almost 1 in 3 soldier on the beach being French. 

So the realistic film would have had almost as many British soldiers on the beach as French, both mingling and discussing.

I fully agree with your point about cinematography, but this is not the point here. I am saying the film shows some kind of ethnically 100% british battle of Dunkirk, when the Dunkirk evacuation involved 100,000 Frenchmen from a French city.

Its similar to portraying some major battle of WW2 or WW1 involving multiple nationalities and only portraying one nationality in it. Its pretty much historical revisionism but I accept it because I will enjoy the film as its Nolan making it.

But as a European and very much knowledgeable about WW2, this is not an accurate portrayal of what really happened. It must be said.

Under Bob Hartley, the Flames had two excellent defensemen performing excellently.  However, the team in general sucked at defense.  It was a system problem.  They had decent personnel (Backlund and later Frolik are both forwards who are defensive stalwarts) but the system was all about risky stretch passes and d-men joining the play left, right and center.

Similarly, wingers get basically zero credit when it comes to defense.  Marchand, in my mind, was the second best defensive forward this year.  The Selke is a centerman's award, which is stupid.",hockey

5375,"Defenders typically enjoy the ability of launching much heavier aircraft from land and from airfields which are not prone to sinking like aircraft carriers. China can use their full air force unlike the US which has to use their carrier capable aircraft only. If they have warning they can also position their forces in advance and lay naval mines. A defender can also use their coastal defense ships, the corvettes and torpedo boats, which are probably better than destroyers and cruisers on a per cost and per life basis aside from the fact that they cannot enter the open ocean. China also has some military facilities in the South China Sea though I honestly do not know much about that beyond that they are probably a good place to lob cruise missiles from. Then the attacker also needs fuel supplies which would be delivered by ships that are easy prey for either submarines or stealth bombers. The advantages a defender has in a naval war are arguably better than those in a land war.

&gt; the attacker usually has the advantage, as they can concentrate their force and strike at targets of their choosing

I do not feel like this is the case since most modern ships are at least semi-stealth, and it is difficult to first of all know where they are all located and second of all doing this would most likely mean walking straight into idling submarines. I could be wrong however I really cannot see how this would be the case.

&gt;Fact is, the US wouldn't need to wage what we'd consider a conventional military campaign against China. China needs immense imports, especially of petrochemicals, to provide for their population.

They can get them from places other than China. The fact is that a trade war would be devastating to the US as well and not just China however I doubt that it would be as devastating as most people believe. Contrary to popular belief China is not the US' largest trading partner and same goes for vice versa. In both cases their largest trading partner is actually the European Union and they are unlikely to press sanctions on China if the US decides to go all up in arms about the sea. If pressed however China can still import oil from Russia and the Russians would be very happy to provide it, since doing so would greatly help their economy and piss off the US as well. The Chinese are already importing oil from Russia actually. And then the Chinese have a considerable amount of oil on their own land, and the sea that they have claimed is also very oil rich. That is the whole reason why they have claimed it in fact.

&gt;Of course it's entirely likely that China in such a situation would at least threaten to launch nukes and that a general exchange would follow

No they likely would not actually as they have a no first use policy towards nukes.",worldnews

I feel they immensly sacrificied what could have been an amazing tone for the usual quips (and bad ones in this case), it totally kept the movie from having its own thing.  

To make a mind bending movie you have to be ready to lose some of your audience and that's something Marvel can't do. They can't do psychedelism, they did pulp (and it works wonder for GotG but not for Strange). We should have had more visual storytelling, more symbolism and stuff beyond words. Here even when we are shown the beyond with those amazing visual effect, the Ancient One is giving some quite banale speech. The visual effects ended being more like fractal porn than something purposeful and interesting. Again fractal porn and trippy funky is cool for GotG (especially 2 with the spongey faces when they travel through dimension) but Strange has the potential to be so much more. 

I am even more mad at Marvel because they have all the money, all the fans and all the material to propose something risky. I usually don't care about MCU stuff but I feel close to Strange because of similar life experience, it was such a mised opportunity. I mean, especially when the movie is supposed to open to ""infinite dimension"" and bring something fresh to Marvel's universe. It ended being the same old same old.

3. Sometimes guys just get to a certain point and don't develop any further.  Not everyone is going to get to the next level.  Vucevic has his glaring weaknesses: lack of range and no defense.

5537,"Sigil of Misery, Sigil of Silence and if you're a blood elf - arcane torrent are the ways to deal with them. Play with Quickened Sigils and pop one just before they finish their cast (and start channeling).

Most important of all - plan out everything before it happens. Download DBM Challenge mode - it has pretty accurate timers for abilities. Go out of Variss' pool 5-6 seconds before arcane adds are about to spawn so you can drop your debuff and reenter when they spawn. I did not know this at first but self healing *does* generate threat, go smack Variss with a Soul Cleave / Spirit Bomb and they will come to you.

Make some macros - button to focustarget Variss and one for Kruul and then Imprison/Consume magic macros that are cast on your focus target, regardless of your current target. I found myself getting killed by Mind Blasts while having high Decay stacks so I made a weakaura that tracks his cast so I can use my defensives or Imprison appropriately.

If you need more tips I would love to help.

Edit: Recalled some more things:

For the Kruul phase - use the focustarget macros to interrupt Twisted Reflections (if you don't make it grab an orb immediately or he will heal). Make/download a weakaura that tracks that and makes a sound (the airhorn works really well). I was usually double jumping, not gliding, most of the time to make it faster/easier to glide out of the fel pool when it does hit. It's not super big damage but a few millions could be useful to have.

Most important thing in Kruul phase (after proper mitigation of course) is abusing the fact that **Kruul can be imprisoned**. This does not fully negate an annihilate cast - it still happens shortly after he breaks free but it gives you some time.

CDs for Annihilation - Spikes on first, Spikes + Brand on second, Meta + Spikes on 3rd, Last Resort on 4th or just hope Kor'vas SOMEHOW manages to take aggro and eat a stack which does like 5% hp to her. It did happen to me on my successful pull (she technically ate the first one not the last) but I'm sure I would have done it eventually even without that.

I did it at 897ish ilvl with a 2pc T19 I believe with Sephuz and Kil'Jaeden's Burning Wish. That was before the Spirit Bomb fiasco though - I kinda wanna be able to retry it again and see if it's way easier with that.",wow

Because the Liberal Part just *isn't* a left-wing party, they never have been. That's their appeal to the majority of Canadians. Canadians like their conservatism *a lot*. This isn't a bias, this is an observation. A left-wing party would never sell off our publicly-owned airports, the Liberal Party is. A left-wing party would never pursue the TPP no matter who was involved, the Liberal Party is. A left-wing party would never increase our military's budget and overseas presence, the Liberal Party is.

I'm not going to argue this with you any further. I'm sorry if it doesn't fit your narrative that Canada is a left-wing socialist nightmare, but a fact is a fact.

Maybe we are more liberal than America, which isn't saying much because your Democratic Party is a conservative party, and your Republic Party is a far-right party.

If you look at what passes for conservatism in the UK or Australia or New Zealand, you're going to see a lot of similarities with Canada and with the American Democratic Party.

But I don't think the rework was a failure, I think their balancing afterwards was the problem.

Zac had one of the lowest dmg done stat per game and they nerfed his dmg. They thought ""lets hit the jungle speed like that"" but there are other ways to just nerf the jungle speed without hurting his dmg too much. The first W dmg nerf was ok, this last one was crap.

What made Zac great? His reliability combined with the jungle clear. they shredded his jungle clear to be pretty slow so that he can't keep up anymore, which means he likely falls out of the jungle.

Instead they should have mostly hit his reliability. 

- Q leash range is too large and has the same problem as LeBlancs leash (updates every ~0.25 sec instead which leads to it proccing even after you flashed away). Increasing the update speed of the Q and reducing the leash range so that you can flash out of the Q range and not get drawn back in would have helped a lot

- Just make Q cost 4% current  HP and the AA afterwards also 4% current HP (nearly the same as it is now, just that you don't lose 4% HP if you can't get the second part off)

- W: Yes, take a bit of dmg away if needed, but 25 flat dmg is huge, too huge.

- E range. Yes, the E range is like that for a long time now, but it is crazy. Just 0-200 less range. 1200-1600 range is still a huge range (maximum channel duration would also need to go down to 0.9-1.2 from 0.9-1.3 sec)

- R is too fast to channel. You can miss the E and land next to a minion, then Q and if the enemy doesn't flash that Q he is probably dead because you can AA a minion, pull him back and R during that pull already. Increase the channel time to 1.2 sec (maybe 1.25) from 1.1 sec to give an enemy that gets pulled by the Q a better chance to get out of his R.

Such nerfs would have helped way more than all the dmg nerfs to his W and the pretty useless CD increase to his Q. In the end they gutted his W so that he will not be playable and say ""we have found out what we want to do with him"". In the end Riot should have used such nerfs patch after patch to try and get him in line. Instead they nerfed him a bit and a bit and then just but off his head instead of going the last step.

He uses his wealth and connections to build a unique omnic with incredible powers to heal and defend others.

2. The US develops the vast majority of European military technology anyway. These budgets would have to balloon to pay for the development cost that the US just eats 

Edit: this is not to say that Europe could not defend itself from Russia for certain, but what is certain is that without the US paying for it, European countries would have to devote much larger % of their gdp to the military instead of all of these social programs that the US government can't afford. 

My American taxes pay for European healthcare. They also pay for places like Honduras' ability to build schools and hospitals.

Considering that the Austrian chancellor rigged the election by disenfranchising the youth vote, you'd be wrong.

If anything, Hitler DID intend to not hold a plebiscite, but the huge popular support after the occupation convinced him to do so.

So to say that Euron shows up and it's just a forced bad guy, well, to me that's just ignoring the whole host of forced good guys who also don't get killed. Part of that is just storytelling. At the end of the day Daenerys Targaryen isn't going to be killed by some Son of the Harpy with a lucky spear throw. 

It's applying these made up ""rules"" to a bad guy rather than a good guy which is at least fairer than simply having all the good guys have plot armor. In this, the good guys have plot armor but the bad guys do too.

I would at least say Euron is far better than Ramsay in this regard given that we've got plenty of backstory for *why* Euron is good at what he does. He's the master of the seas, a famous ship captain with a decade-plus of experience, probably the best sailor in the world. He's very well established as ""good at ships,"" so it's not a surprise that in a ship battle, he did well.

The only thing that bothered me about Ramsay, was that there was no real reason for him to be hyper-competent at war. He was a young lord, sure he would have some martial training, but where would he have infiltrated an enemy's camp with 20 men and set fire to everything?

5971,"Spoken word ""songs"" date back way farther than ""The Revolution Will Not be Televised.""  Just a few:

""Deck of Cards""— 1948 - T. Tex Tyler

""And Friends"" - 1959 - Wink Martindale (Yes - the game show host Martindale, who was a Top 40 DJ before that. Speaking of which, I recall Casey Kasem did one too, called ""Letter to Elaina (1964), which was a minor hit for the Caser.

""Making Love (At the Dark End of the Street),""  - Clarence Carter 1969

In the early 50s, Hank Williams did spoken-rhyme songs, but under the pseudonym ""Luke the Drifter.""

Granted - these are more like story-songs than modern rap, and perhaps not spoken as rhythmically, but nevertheless, are the progenitors of rap and hip-hop.

The origin of the word ""rap"" as applied to talking in music, dates back to the early 70s. When the hip and groovy young people of the late 60s (hippies, etc.) wanted to talk, they'd say, ""Let's rap.""  They didn't mean, perform a song.  But that's the origin of the word.

There wasn't really much else apart from drug sites or gun sites, hitmen' and piracy for mostly books. Lots of Russian sights too. I went on a couple deepweb search engines too so I could see if they showed different websites and stuff. 

I remember I was getting bored and wanted to search for something like conspiracy theories and a completely random site was one of the results, it was titled something like 'RED ROOM', I had heard of red rooms which I believe were live streams of people being murdered and tortured and........really messed up shit.

My stomach dropped but I didn't think you could find something like that so easily or randomly. My curiosity got the best of me and I clicked the link and it was a black screen that just had the text 'click to enter RED ROOM'. I stupidly and foolishly and idiotically clicked on it and I was taken to another black screen where there was only a video that was buffering.....

When I realised that this could be a legitimate red room i unplugged my computer from the wall without any fucking hesitation and noped out of there.

6338,"I seriously suggest giving jake's articles a read, they're extremely well written, well sourced, and present a pretty unique take on different OW topics.

On to the main topic, one tricking will provide better performance statwise, but does not guarantee more wins. If a team is full of dps one tricks that can't or won't play heals or tanks, on average, they would lose to a team of flex players that can build a solid comp.

The advantage of flex players is better access to counters. I'm a Pharah main, if I run up against a team that has no experience on soldier or mccree, I'm a happy camper. But if the other team has even a decent flex on soldier, coupled with a zen, i'm not gonna have a fun time. On the other hand, if the DPS slots are full and I'm playing heals or tank, I perform much worse.

Overwatch is very much built around counter-picking and team play, and OTPs, by nature, are weaker at these than flex players.

Anecdotal evidence doesn't prove much, I essentially one trick [Pharah](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/nevillelin-1622/heroes/pharah?mode=competitive), with above average stats in most categories, and I've been climbing pretty consistently (haven't had a huge amount of time for comp in the last few weeks though).

&gt; C2C (also known as Coups2Cross) was born in 1998 from the meeting of 4 French Dj's: Greem, Atom, Pfel and 20Syl. Members of an emerging movement called scratch music (or turntablism), this crew keeps working on finding original sounds and knows how to benefit from its technical control to put forward some musical quality which makes its identity. Each member uses his turntable as an instrument, recreating in turn drums or bass guitars, scratching a riff of guitar or shearing the brass... to lead to a general harmony such as bands made up of instruments known as ""traditional"".

&gt; C2C has obtained in September 2006 its fourth DMC team world champion title in a row. With their previous victory in 2003, 2004 and 2005 they achieve a historical quadruple and break Dj Craze's records, the only Dj that has made it 3 times in a row until today... This crown is in fact the result of a keen upstream work: while taking part regularly in competitions, they make progress and make a clean sweep of the best ranks as they also won ITF 2005 team world Champion title and Hip Hop World Challenge title. Pfel, the last Dj getting in the crew, round off this prize list by his collection of trophies won in solo competitions (DMC, ITF). This rise leads them in parallel to perform all around the world with Q-Bert, A-Trak, Dj Kentaro, The Scratch Perverts or DJ Vadim. Exploiting at the very maximum human as well as material possibilities (mixers effects, feedback, larsens...), the show presented on tour is out of breath for the listener. The denseness of sequences is cut by technical parts meant to underline individual performances. Routines give way to live compositions mixing turntables of one, machines of another finish brilliantly with the 6 minutes sets having made them champions of the world four times in a row! 

&gt; On the creation side, the quartet excels too and particularly in realizing pieces intended for producing. Thanks to their various experiences and after a long soundgrubbing work, they launch out a whole series of breakbeats entitled Flyin' Saucer (3 volumes to date) including several own innovations. A recent proof of their qualities in this field: 20Syl and Greem, respectively Mc and DJ of the band called Hocus Pocus, invited the two others C2C Djs to take part in its new album 73 Touches (On And On records). This collaboration has just led on a track completely played with turntables. They're now working on their first album which will lead them to a further step in their artform. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; The Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase. Read more on Last.fm.

Well no shit. He is affected  by the nationalism in Russia and Russian nationalism.

Ukraine can't influence Russia with their nationalism.

&gt;sanctions are not due to nationalism

But they are. It is part of Russian Nationalism that the Ukraine doesn't exist, that Crimea is Russia, that Ukrainians are Russians (you guys are like us on smaller scale, serbia vs western serbia)... Hence you could make a case that nationalism helped imposed sanctions on Russia

Sanctions where oligarchs lose a lot of money to be quite honest.

&gt;Sanctions are due to Russia's stupid decisions for almost everything.

But they're not stupid decisions. If they accepted their guilt they'd have to admit to supplying and providing soldiers and equipment in Eastern Ukraine. Which is worse than having sanctions, since technically it's an act of war.

While technically right now, Russia and Ukraine are not at war. 

People need to realise that truth doesn't matter, appearance does.

6563,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

But just in general, it feels wrong to me. The Dark Tower ... I don't know why, but it just doesn't have anything ""black""-ish to it. It's not a black type of folk tale. It doesn't feel congruent.

Maybe if he had gone all the way and just had the whole story play in some Nigerian desert ... and instead of revolvers, there'd be bows or whatever and everyone else would be black and it would kind of be a descendant of some black tribe .... yeah okay, at least that would be congruent.

But a King Arthur like descendance ... with black people? That isn't congruent to me. I can't explain why, sorry, but that's how I feel.",conspiracy

I'm a good Pharah player, but frequently play Mercy because I like to be a team player and fill. As a result, Mercy ended up being my most played, with a ton of hours on Lucio too. I wanted to be a team player. It got to the point where my teammates in pre-game lobby would just assume I am picking Mercy and not pick a healer, forcing me into the role. After a night of frustrating losses where I only played Mercy, I started fighting back. I started not picking her and telling my teams, ""if you want a Mercy, someone else is going to have to play her"" and I stuck to Pharah, or D.Va if we needed a tank.

Like I said, I think I'm really good on Pharah (and D.Va too) but I rarely got the chance to shine as people wanted me on Mercy, or assumed my skill level of other heros was lacking. I still love Mercy, but I loved Mercy so much more when I wasn't feeling obligated to pick her. I also loved her so much more when she wasn't so meta, so for now, I'm trying to climb with other heros, but the stigma on Mercy mains really needs to stop. It's fueling further toxicity. People don't want to play support, then flame other people opting to play support with the most healing-oriented hero in the game is so laughable. You can never please everyone.",Overwatch

His reference is talking about North American (NA) natives not South American (SA) or Polynesian's who are known to be sea going explorers, **massive** difference between these two groups Polynesian's / SA would have been technologically decades if not centuries ahead of any NA natives.

&gt; Also good to know you think there are no native monuments in the world???

Off of the top of my head examples would be the Moai of Easter Island, created by Polynesians who also migrated to Hawaii or the Mayans structures no one denies these.

&gt;Like massive totem poles don't exist?

NA natives built these sure but compare that to the Moai of Easter Island and what is so special about them (totem poles) again?

&gt; The huge array of cultural art they produced

What culture has not created art?  The Mayans have some of the most interesting early art using a combination of metals, fabrics and gems vs NA's leather, feathers and a few homemade dyes?

&gt;Like really?

I feel like the OP's argument here is about NA natives and what they accomplished as a people/culture **on their own**.  You could argue that them migrating across the ice sheets from Asia during the last ice age was an accomplishment and is, however once they got here it seems like the status quo for NA natives was just to migrate around following the food source and never really growing as a culture (I guess we have a different idea of what growing is).  Now compare that to the Mayans who accomplished architecture, mathematics, a calendar, and astronomical system.  I'd agree with what the OP has said comparatively to some native cultures around the world they pretty much stayed hunters and gathers something that humans have been doing for probably 100k's of years while other cultures seemed to have grown without the help of Europeans on their own naturally.

The Tyrell style isn't to make great moves, its to make a lot of small and subtle moves by expanding their influence. Like a rose (or more accurately, weeds) you won't see them making sudden power grabs. But their power would still keep increasing and before you know it, the place is covered in them.


Their ""great play"" was already done with their introduction when they managed to make Margaery Queen. They managed to put their people on the small council and they made alliances in other places without making enemies. They tried to get North on their side through Sansa, which almost worked. And Margaery was working on the High Septon by making sure that she and Loras got to go free after Cersei's trial was over. 


Their ""weakness"" would be that they expect others to act rationally as they do.

In its beginning, it had valid points against a group, that tried to bring their politics into both computer- as well as tabletop- and LARP. For no apparent reason, this group had an extremely strong media support despite saying dumb things and doing some shady things. Kotakuinaction had valid and well-argued points against this move to politicise gaming. But time went by and Sarkeesian shifted into obscurance, Atheism+ dissappeared and Kotaku was eventually sold. Many people lost interest into the subs original cause as it had won. Seeing this a-posteriori, it is clear that when the presidential campaigns started, there was a push against the left in general, against the media, and especially against Clinton.

This is really the only one which can be considered really good. Grovewalker is the second best, but is considerably weaker and is worth about the same 1 weapon ilvl difference as our third best trait Knowledge of the Ancients. Everything else is essentially equal, whatever relic increases your weapon level the most is really all that matters for the rest.

Emerald Nightmare had one relic for Knowledge of the Ancients I believe. No Persistence or Grovewalker.

Trial of Valor had one relic with Knowledge of the Ancients again. No Persistence or Grovewalker.

Nighthold had ZERO relics with a top three trait. Out of dozens of relics in this raid, there were absolutely non with any value whatsoever for resto outside of pure ilvl boosts.

Tomb of Sargeras has two relics with Knowledge of the Ancients. Yet again, no Persistence or Grovewalker.

See a pattern? Resto hasn't even had a chance to get a top two relic from any Legion raid.

6918,"There are a few issues that they have, that Netflix isn't bound by Canadian Content Laws, that they rely on the infrastructure of communication corporations like Bell, Rogers, Shaw and Telus, who are pretty much the main competition to Netflix in Canada, and that they run a strictly on-demand service.

The first issue is pretty easy to understand, Netflix isn't currently required for its library to carry a certain percentage of Canadian content, and they aren't required to help fund Canadian content creation.

The second issue is also easy to understand. Obviously as a strictly internet based company they have no need to build their own infrastructure like the incumbents have. 

The third issue, and probably the biggest of them is that Netflix offers on-demand services, they don't just broadcast channels like the incumbents do, who supplement with on-demand channels. Everyone in Canada would LOVE ""a la carte"" programming, where you only pick the channels you want, but that isn't economically feasible for these companies, which is why you have to buy a basic line-up and then get extra packages. Netflix can bypass this because they only license specific shows, and do not license network access and the content that comes with that network.

Almost all policeman carry weapons and that something you can see just by walking by. You found a situation where what you say is true, but it doesn't mean is always true. 

Yes, almost all terrorist attacks have a high death count, but would handguns have helped in Madrid's attacks in 2004, the most deadly attack in Europe ever? No. In London's in 2005? No. But you can find several examples of ETA terrorists beeing shooted at by spanish police corps and/or french police corps.
No one prizes the criminal's life over the policeman's, people just prize live more. If we had to choose, obviously the policeman's live would come first but if you don't have to choose, why choosing?

Lastly, shooting in that situation would have been dangeorus. There were five policeman surrounding him, so if you shoot and miss you are risking one of your mates lifes, even if they weren't surrounding him, there's a crowd behind him, so any lost bullet could harm someone with a high probability. I don't know if you have seen pictures or videos of the border, but it's crowded there. Several thousands cross the border everyday. Someone would have taken a lost bullet for sure.

There is a wide gap between public expectation of what the EU *should* do and what it actually does (or indeed, is allowed to do). Dealing with the common market is all very fine and well, but it ""sells"" the EU less than acting on pressing issues. The migration crisis has been simmering for years, yet the EU is not a metre closer to a true and effective ""European"" solution. That's what breeds scepticism among the masses of ordinary voters: ""if the EU is unable to act on this, what is it good for? All they do is talk and talk.""

The elites know how difficult things really are, but the rest of the voters do not. And if the elites keep failing to make the EU seem to work for the masses as well as the elites, its reputation will plummet. If the EU acted resolutely and effectively in the migration crisis (e.g. by setting up robust common EU border guards, establishing safe zones in Libya and Syria, creating off-shore asylum processing facilities to discourage further illegal attempts to reach European shores with fake asylum claims, etc.), its approval ratings would be 50% better there days.",europe

&gt; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (born Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart; 27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) is among the most significant and enduring popular composers of European classical music. His enormous output includes works that are widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music.  Many of his works are part of the standard concert repertoire and are widely recognized as masterpieces of classical music.

&gt; The central traits of the classical style can all be identified in Mozart's music.  Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks, though a simplistic notion of the delicacy of his music obscures for us the exceptional and even demonic power of some of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, K. 491, the Symphony No 40 in G minor, K. 550, and the opera Don Giovanni. The famed writer on music Charles Rosen has written (in The Classical Style): ""It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous."" Especially during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time. The slow introduction to the ""Dissonant"" Quartet, K. 465, a work that Haydn greatly admired, rapidly explodes a shallow understanding of Mozart's style as light and pleasant.

&gt; Born in Salzburg, Austria, from his earliest years Mozart had a gift for imitating the music he heard; which his father believed was a gift from God.  

&gt; Since he traveled widely, he acquired a rare collection of experiences from various bordels to create his unique compositional language. When he went to London[13] as a child, he met J.C. Bach and heard his music; when he went to Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna, he heard the work of composers active there, as well as the spectacular Mannheim orchestra; when he went to Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which were to be hugely influential on his development. Both in London and Italy, the galant style was all the rage: simple, light music, with a mania for cadencing, an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other chords, symmetrical phrases, and clearly articulated structures. This style, out of which the classical style evolved, was a reaction against the complexity of late Baroque music. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are ""homotonal"" (each movement in the same key, with the slow movement in the parallel minor). Others mimic the works of J.C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms commonly being written by composers in Vienna. One of the most recognizable features of Mozart's works is a sequence of harmonies or modes that usually leads to a cadence in the dominant or tonic key. This sequence is essentially borrowed from baroque music, especially Bach. But Mozart shifted the sequence so that the cadence ended on the stronger half, i.e., the first beat of the bar. Mozart's understanding of modes such as Phrygian is evident in such passages.

&gt; As Mozart matured, he began to incorporate some more features of Baroque styles into his music. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A Major K. 201 uses a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had just published his Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (""Storm and Stress"") period in German literature, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era to come, is evident in some of the music of both composers at that time.

&gt; Over the course of his working life, Mozart switched his focus from instrumental music to operas, and back again. He wrote operas in each of the styles current in Europe: opera buffa, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, or Così fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberflöte is probably the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he developed the use of subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestration, and tone colour to express or highlight psychological or emotional states and dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted. His increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concerti served as a resource in his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.

The second foot can pivot anywhere it wants after any amount of time the player wants as long as the pivot foot stays on the ground.  When the pivot foot comes off the ground or if it comes off the ground while making the second step, the player has to get rid of the ball before the pivot foot touches the ground again.  That's the only rule any ref calls at any level.  If they don't call it like that, they are wrong.

7119,"Okay, I am describing the nature of the inherent conflict, and taking time to point out that the *best* parents have this issue, so I'm obviously not taking the stance that the parents in this situation are basely wrong about anything. I have every sympathy for parents who take issue with the way things are done at a school. I understand that it is their right, and if they handle themselves appropriately and approach the problems they encounters constructively, then everyone wins - student, teacher, and parent. I also see that any parent who is appropriately involved in their child's life is going to run into problems of this kind, and it would be surprising if they or their kid's teacher was right every time. This is about developing an appropriate relationship and respecting the boundaries of the role of parent and teacher.


Unfortunately, in the passive aggressive age of electronic communication, people often make the mistake of either reacting before they contextualize that which they are reacting to, or get angry instead of trying to solve problems. What happens in both of these scenarios is that they interfere with their children's education, develop antagonistic relationships with their children's instructors, and most importantly, the problems they are trying to identify usually go unaddressed. Or even worse, the problems escalate past the teacher and they teach their children all kinds of bad lessons about acting entitled and getting your way by circumventing existing systems with privilege or volume.


So listen - as a teacher, I was very open to questions about my curriculum and the materials we worked with. Further, when parents approached me with issues in an appropriate setting in an appropriate way, I worked hard to find solutions that worked for everyone involved. Unfortunately, more often I had to deal with parents calling me out in front of a group, or screaming at me with no particular agenda or solution, or trying to push an ideology or set of ideologies which had no place in public education (not just religion - also bad psychology, dogma, and 9/11 induced fear of the world).


And before there are any responses which have anecdotes in them, let's just get right out ahead of that and say that the blame in this type of conflict can side with the teacher just as easily as with the parent, and I have friends who are parents that have had bad interactions with teachers whom I sided with, and colleagues who were teachers that were out of line on issues of this kind. Shit - I've been on the wrong side of this argument before plenty of times, though I like to think I was usually able to achieve equanimity before closing out most issues permanently. No anecdote can change the basic issues at stake, however, or what can be done by reasonable people to minimize the difficulties and help kids to grow and learn about themselves and their world.


TL;DR: There's nothing wrong with the natural conflict between teacher and parent; there's everything wrong with resolving these types of conflicts inappropriately.",movies

The Vedas teach this whole cosmos is really a school and we're all at different 'grade levels' in our education... none lesser or greater than any others. But in order to have a Creation (a drama) of necessity some are in kindergarten while others are graduating Princeton. In that scenario certain individuals may be at a seemingly 'higher' level of consciousness than the masses. So even though we're presently in the early stages of Dwapara Yuga, some are still in Kali while others are in their own personal Golden Age. Still, the overall mass consciousness prevails in the day-to-day politics and social mores; it can't be helped, it's God's Lila.

If you get to the trade deadline without moving him then there will be very few teams where the cap space and need is there and that drives his price down.

* A soft cap would be bad for owners with internal spending limits (Ottawa, Winnipeg) as it decreases parity which is something the NHL has done nothing but increase over the last decade and a half. 
* It would be bad for fringe teams because revenue sharing wouldn't be as robust since overall profitability drops. 
* It would only benefit the top few players in the league while the NHLPA has historically had representation from and fought for the little guys.
* Perhaps most importantly, it would raise Escrow rates as teams would be consistently spending well above the 50% HRR split and would require more kickback from the players to be made whole. Escrow is at the forefront of what the NHLPA wants to change and is likely one of the largest contributors to why there will be a lockout. That's going to take priority.

Great for Toronto but you need to get the NHLPA and get another 20 teams on board when it's probably only going to benefit the top 5-10% or less for each. I just don't see that happening.",hockey

7295,"That's a fair thing to say, I guess I meant that in part, I think Sanchez wouldn't sign anyway so offering it just somewhat sets a terrible precedent for other players. We offer Sanchez 300k a week, but he leaves, so Ozil is like.... well I'm leaving unless I get 300k a week. Then Walcott says he's leaving unless he gets 180k, because they offered 300k to Sanchez and on and on.

Ultimately he's 28, actually he'll be 29 in December, so if he stays with us he'll be almost 30 the next time he has a chance to play in the CL. If he signs for 4 years, he's basically saying he won't win a CL or league title till he's 32 and then he would hope a top team wants him at that age. The other option is leave at worst a year from now to a top team, for him the choice is pretty obvious so I think making huge offers only hurts Arsenal on the whole.

I'd like Sanchez to stay, but if he wants bigger money or more success he's got to stay elsewhere, if he loves Arsenal and thinks Wenger can win, he'd stay for a reasonable wage increase but we shouldn't break the bank to save one player.

7389,"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is preparing to wait out his contract and leave Arsenal on a free transfer next summer, after rejecting a take-it-or-leave-it offer from the club.

The young England attacker was offered a significant wage increase to extend his deal at the Emirates but declined - because his priority is playing time, rather than improving his terms.

Liverpool were rebuffed when they made a direct approach to Arsenal to discuss Oxlade-Chamberlain’s availability, earlier this week, leaving all parties at an impasse. Oxlade-Chamberlain is attracted by the idea of playing for Jurgen Klopp, given Klopp’s record with developing the attacking gifts of players such as Adam Lallana, Gini Wijnaldum and Sadio Mane.

At 23, he is most eager to nail down a regular role in a top team and start games consistently – something that has not quite happened at Arsenal, despite six seasons there. Though Arsene Wenger has said Oxlade-Chamberlain figures prominently in his plans, experience has made the player cautious regarding promises about a starting role.

Oxlade-Chamberlain is determined to be in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup, but is prepared to run down his contract – which expires in 2018 – even if that means being jettisoned from Arsenal’s team.


Arsenal are believed to value Oxlade-Chamberlain at £25m, despite the limited time left on his deal. Since joining from Southampton, for an initial £12m in 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored 20 times in 194 games for the Gunners, winning 27 England caps.

The impasse over a valued talent is yet another thing to deal with at a busy time for Arsenal, who are close to agreement with Lyon over Alexandre Lacazette after indicating they are willing to break their club record of £42.4m to sign the prolific French striker.

They are embroiled in sagas with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez over contract extensions. Both star players have so far declined hefty wage offers to stay with Sanchez valuing himself so highly that Bayern Munich were quoted wage demands of €25m per season (£420,000 per week) when they explored his situation.

Bayern’s interest in the Chilean has now receded, leaving Manchester City likeliest to sign Sanchez should he leave the Emirates. Like Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain he has one year remaining on his current deal.

Why hack a Zarya to remove her bubbles if your team won't make use of it during the few seconds you have? Sombra can deal good damage on her own, but not if the whole enemy team is suddenly focusing you because your team decided to back up after your hack.

The biggest issue, at least what I've noticed, is most people don't play Overwatch cooperatively. They play it as if each person is doing their own individual job and contributing to the team via killing the enemy team faster.

7567,"#Projected Starting Lineup and Camp Battles - Defensive Edition  
  
##Starting Lineup - Defense  
  
**DE – Brandon Graham, Chris Long (?):** Really, the only player at this position that is a lock to start is Brandon Graham. The 2016 2nd team All-Pro is the personification of “sacks don’t mean everything.” Per PFF and Football Outsiders, Graham finished [second](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2017/defense-and-pass-pressure-2016) in the league in pressures. Sure, sacks are important, but so is the ability to alter what the offense is doing. However, I will admit, Graham needs to find a way to up the sack totals. Regardless, Graham was outstanding in 2016 and could have a repeat performance.   
  
After BG, the starting spot gets murky – although murky is a bit misleading. As the roster currently stands, there is no sure fire starter opposite Graham. The Eagles signed Chris Long to replace Connor Barwin. Long is a better fit for the defense and should be a good rotational piece. Vinny Curry is looking to have a better season after disappointing fans throughout last season. Curry had 2.5 sacks in 2016 as a rotational rusher and never seemed to earn the complete trust of the coaching staff. It is possible that Curry was injured for part of the year given a minor injury he suffered last preseason, but he wasn’t close to the explosive rusher he was in previous years, which is what makes his 2016 season so aggravating. Curry was always miscast in Chip Kelly’s defensive philosophy. The excitement for what he could do under Schwartz was high given how he fit that mold. Schwartz was backing Curry in one of his offseason press conferences, saying that Curry did get a lot of pressure but still had some consistency issues. Maybe it is coach speak, since I didn’t see what they saw. Regardless, Curry can’t be moved this year, so the Eagles have to hope Curry bounces back a bit.  
  
I already wrote about what Derek Barnett brings to the Eagles in another section, but it’s worth repeating that he should see significant snaps as a rookie for the Eagles. One positive to our current depth chart is Barnett won’t be forced to carry a heavy load, but he will see work as he improves. He excels as a pass rusher and as a run defender, the latter of which Curry doesn’t. If Barnett is able to develop a secondary inside counter rush move, he could see even more playing time.  
  
BG, Curry, Long, and Barnett are locks to make the roster. The Eagles may choose to keep 1 or 2 more players and have 3 players competing for those spots. The first is 2017 7th round pick Alex McCalister, who spent 2016 on “IR” serving what was basically a red-shirt year. McCalister is tall defensive end, at 6’6” but was significantly undersized at 239 pounds at the combine last year. Last month, McCalister weighed in at 251 pounds. In addition to the weight, McCalister needed to get stronger in order to compete in the NFL. I don’t know what to expect from him this summer but it feels like the coaching staff loves him and he has every opportunity to win a spot. Steven Means is the next man up competing for a spot. Means earned a spot on the roster last summer after having a terrific preseason. He even played in a few games last year.  Means doesn’t have a ton of upside as an edge rusher but could be solid in a rotational role. One thing I love about Means is his competitiveness. When he is on the field, you can see him bust his ass every play.   
  
After Means, comes Marcus Smith. The 2014 1st round pick has done nothing but disappoint in his 3 seasons with the team. Although MSWho has improved each year, those improvements have been incremental. Instead of becoming a quality player, he sucks *just a little bit less.* At this point, MSBoo is dead weight and likely to be cut prior to the start of camp. Smith missed all of the voluntary OTA periods due to them being “voluntary.” Yes, I agree, it was voluntary, so he didn’t have to show up. That’s fine, I get it. But let’s cut the BS for one second: everyone knows that a 1st round bust has no business having this approach if he wants to keep his job, which he probably doesn’t. And that’s fine, I understand the need for a fresh start, but it’s not like he did much to impress future employers. The Eagles can save about $1.5 million against the cap if they cut MSShoo by the 3rd day of camp. I would be shocked if they didn’t do it. He is dead weight and a reminder of a failed regime. Just do it already.  
  
I’m not sure how many rushers the Eagles plan on keeping, but I think a logical guess would be 5. Of the 3 mentioned above, I think Means has the best shot of making the team. He is a special team’s contributor and is further along as a DE than McCalister is – at least from what we have on tape. McCalister has much higher upside than Means and could play his way onto the roster this summer, but Means is the safer pick based on what we know about their abilities. Either way, the spot comes down to one of these two.
  
**DT – Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan:** [COX](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/798251631997546496)  
  
The Eagles made the correct decision letting Bennie Logan walk earlier in free agency. While every fan, and likely every coach, loved Bennie, I believe the team needed to find an upgrade to him and not commit more money than they should along the defensive line. It was a difficult challenge for the Eagles considering cap concerns, but they were able to pull it off when trading for Timmy Jernigan. Jernigan [has more sacks in fewer games and starts while being 3 years younger](https://twitter.com/BrandonGowton/status/849343061989699584) than Logan. Jernigan played in a system in Baltimore that didn’t have him attack as much as he will here. [He can get after the QB](https://twitter.com/BrandonGowton/status/849347979421110273). He’s also [relentless and strong](https://twitter.com/BaldyNFL/status/849343312477786113). One downside to Jernigan is he is on the last year of his rookie deal. I would think the Eagles would try to re-sign him but it’ll be difficult considering the number of rich contracts along the defensive line already. We’ll see, but he’ll be starting alongside Cox.  
  
A lot has been said about Cox throughout the season, ranging from the typical mouth breathers questioning if he is playing hard enough, to Cox actually taking over games. As you would expect, Cox was excellent in 2016. Even though Cox had a few more penalties than normal, good players play aggressive. [Here are 8 plays against the Packers where Cox makes an impact](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/803989699966730241). According to Fran Duffy, against Green Bay, [Cox was blocked with a single player on 3 of Rodgers 27 pass attempts](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/804004689297739776). He is a [monster](http://giant.gfycat.com/OrganicShorttermDarwinsfox.gif) on the interior, but there wasn’t enough help around him on a consistent basis outside of Graham. Logan was a fine player for the Eagles but Jernigan simply offers more. Barwin was everyone’s favorite, but Long offers more. Barnett is as good a pass rushing prospect you will find. But damn, [I could watch Cox all day long](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/793537901661417473).  
  
There is more around Cox now. After the top 2 guys, the Eagles will keep Beau Allen, who may start the year on PUP after surgery to fix his torn titty. The Eagles kept UDFA Destiny Vaeao last year and may do so again, but there is more competition along the interior line this year. Gabe Wright was a late addition for the Eagles, who was cut from the Lions. He has the opportunity to earn a spot as a rotational rusher. Rookie Elijah Qualls is an intriguing prospect who could sneak a spot on the roster too. The starters are set but those reserves are not. Not the deepest position group on the team, but there are plenty of solid options to help out on the line.

7569,"Over the years I've had strong somewhat ""on-and-off"" dislikes for many teams, but there's two that always seem to resonate more than the others, into a full-fledged ""hatred"" if you will.

* 1. Tampa, and my general dislike for them existed before they whopped our asses two years in a row in the playoffs, but has really developed into a pure hatred the past three seasons. It always seems that no matter how injured, beat up, and weary Tampa is, they always seem to find a way to win against us. I'm convinced that the entire Lightning team could get seriously injured in an accident (hypothetical, of course) and still go out on the ice and kick our asses. Tampa has beat the Red Wings 12 out of their last 13 matchups. It's definitely a sour grapes situation, and with Kucherov coming off a fantastic season and Stamkos healthy again, I have no doubt they'll have a really good upcoming season, but even with their supposed 'defensive struggles' this season, that didn't really seem to be a factor with their games against Detroit? 
* 2. Montreal, and to be fair, this is more an intense dislike for their fanbase. I just can't stand how ruthless and cruel they seem to be, especially towards their own players when they're underperforming. After their storied history and no other team coming anywhere close to their Cup wins, and with their current cup drought being their longest in franchise history, of course the fanbase expects greatness. But even with the Cup drought, they constantly brag about Price being the greatest goalie in the world like it's an absolute undeniable fact (you can't argue or debate or compare other goalies, it drives me up a wall, he's absolutely up there, I just feel he still has more to prove before you can give someone that title.) and I just honestly don't like their logo, or their jerseys, or their team name.

This is the reality I've faced in every single one. Did one last night with 4 friends. 2 healers, 3 DPS including me.

Couldn't find tanks or a 3rd healer. Found them all eventually, killed the first 4 bosses in normal without any wipes. Booted bad DPS, got new DPS. After every single one of those bosses, either a tank or the 3rd healer left. In the time we had to WAIT to get another, someone else left. It's a never ending cycle that eventually will kill the group when you no longer have tanks/healers queueing because they want to kill the half of the instance you have already cleared.

It's normal. It's not about wiping to content as you're implying, it's about putting asses in seats that don't leave every pull. Eventually, that well dries up and you're fucked. What should be a 90-120min run ends up being 240hrs over 5 days, re-killing bosses in 5-7 different groups because people bail the fuck out after 0 wipes.

7616,"Oh, I think I gotcha. You're saying that people are now fine with Amazon's regular technical difficulties and big paywall and Netflix' way of releasing shows because they don't like the shows currently airing on those services. 

In that case, first of all my opinion on that: I think you're wrong. People are still complaining about things. The problems with Netflix and especially Amazon didn't go away just because some shows are poorly received. I think what is making you believe that people are fine with it now is that you don't see the complaints on reddit as much anymore. That is probably because you will see most of them during the time when the services announce which shows they licensed and not as much in the episode discussion threads. As I said, the problems are still there and you will see the discussions again when we start getting news for the next season. 

And second, one thing I want to mention: I think your title and even the post itself are very misleading if this is the point you're making. A title like that and the post mostly being critiques (if you can call Digibro's and Best Guy Ever's mindless nitpicky bashing a critique) makes it seem like you just want to bash the shows yourself, basically saying ""look at you and your hype, you were wrong"". Next time you want to make a point or start a discussion about the problems with certain streaming services you might want to make the post mostly about that.

7637,"I'll break it down I guess. Madoka I thought was good, but not as good as r/anime has raved about it. The story wasn't as amazing that I thought it was gonna be, but I still liked it. The animation though was gorgeous to look at.

Black Rock Shooter - now I read some past posts on this and the general take on it was that people thought it was too confusing. I loved it, I thought the story was awesome and overall I enjoyed it more than Madoka. 

Special A was a great watch. A rom-com that I enjoyed. 

RahXephon OVA - a nice, quick philosophical watch but nothing compared to the main series. 

H.O.T.D. was fanservice galore with good action. Though if I ever get caught in a zombie apocalypse there ain't no fucking way am I gonna group with a bunch of whiners. 

Battle Angel Alita was a damn good 60 minutes of a story that needs more attention and a full length series. 

Bakemonogatari was, so far the best watch. This was simply the grandest anime I've watched out of all of 'em. I'm a complete sucker for the subtle romances in anime and this one did a perfect job at it. The animation, the story arcs, EVERYTHING about it was art!

I'm a complete sucker for the ones that have a subtle romance and tragedy among the characters and in the plot as well. So to answer your question, out of everything I watched, Black Rock Shooter and Bakemonogatari were the only ones that I didn't feel were 'meh.'  ",anime

7645,"TL;DR: It is more complicated, yes, it is possible for SKT to make it to playoffs but still can't make it to Worlds.

I messed up a bit in my response. To clear it up:

There are 3 spots(seeds) for Worlds with different ways to secure:

* 1^st seed: Winning Summer Split, that's it;

* 2^nd seed: Accumulating the highest Circuit Points(CP, points you get from playoffs result, the higher you rank, the more points you get);

* 3^rd seed: Winning the Regional Qualifiers

The current CP stand is:

&gt; SKT 90, from being 1^st in Spring

&gt; KT 70, from being 2^nd in Spring

&gt; SSG 50, from being 3^rd in Spring

&gt; MVP 30, you know the logic now

&gt; AFS 10

CP from Summer would weight more than Spring, which is:

&gt; 1^st: 0 but doesn't matter as the team will be the 1^st seed by default

&gt; 2^nd: 90

&gt; 3^rd: 70

&gt; Etc.

So, mathematically speaking, it is possible that SKT makes it to playoffs but doesn't secure Worlds, let's say

* SSG wins Summer, so they get the 1^st seed;

* KT is the second runner, so they will accumulate 160 CP.(70+90)

* SKT is placed third, so they will also accumulate 160 CP.(90+70)

In this scenario, it will result a tire-breaker between SKT and KT to determine who get the 2^nd seed.

If SKT lose, KT will be the 2^nd seed; SKT will be placed as the 1^st seed in the Regional Qualifiers which is also held in a gauntlet format. If SKT beat the final challenger, they are the 3^rd seed, otherwise, GG.

In other words, yes, SKT can make it to playoff but still can't make it to Worlds. However, if they can secure a Summer final spot, they are auto-qualified to Worlds as they will hold the highest CP anyway. The matter will be about being the 1^st seed or the 2^nd seed at that point.

I don't think SKT will not make it to Worlds tho, the split is far from over, they still have enough time to get back in track.",leagueoflegends

First thing - In my opinion anyone guilty of either of those crimes should also get a permanent ban from all sport competitions. Not my decision but those are also easy calls for me. If you beat on women or torture animals for kicks, get your piece of shit ass out of my league and don't ever come back.

Second thing - Those crimes are committed against other people (or animals). They are outlawed for a reason, but they don't harm the sport that the guilty parties are involved in, beyond the bad optics of it all. So they are not comparable offenses.

Match fixing harms the competition *itself*, not a single individual. All of the other players, the organizers, and most of all the fans are harmed when someone intentionally loses a match in exchange for money.

That is why I don't think a permanent ban from competition is too extreme a punishment. If you don't value the integrity of the sport, you don't deserve to compete in it.",GlobalOffensive

7671,"&gt;Yeah, but you adjusted them in a way that doesn't account for the fact that overall level of talent in the NFL has increased and become more consistent. When people pointed out that you should use standard deviation instead, you just said ""yeah I thought about that but i don't think it'll make a difference."" Well guess what bud? It does make a difference. PFF's advanced passing stats are adjusted for era using standard deviation, and their stats look a lot different than the adjusted stats that you produced. According to PFF's advanced passing metrics, which are a lot more reliable than yours, Brady and Montana's stats are almost exactly even with maybe a slight edge to Brady.

Hahaha, you're purposefully misconstruing my points now, what the fuck, you're actually just lying.  Thats pathetic.  I compared the all-time great QBs of both eras as an example that the greats were still just as dominant back then.  And if you want a better example, Manning actually beats Montana using a lot of era-adjusted stats, why is Brady unable to do so?  And please link me to PFF's era adjusted stats because a cursory search didnt return anything for me.

&gt;When you finally admitted that AV was completely useless in the way you were trying to use it, you started using RAW RECEIVING stats to conclude that Brady's weapons were better instead of adjusting them to make them comparable across eras. Of course Brady's receivers are going to have better stats, the era that they play in has a MUCH HIGHER volume of passing, so there's more yards and touchdowns to go around. And if you adjusted Rice, Moss, and Gronk's stats for era, you would see that Rice is a lot better than both of them combined compared to that era. Which was funny because you made that statement yourself in a different thread. You change your argument depending on if you want Montana to be the greatest of all time, or if you want Rice to be the greatest of all time. No consistency what so ever.

You're actually lying right now, again.  Literally, fucking quote where I just used raw receiving stats to compare them, please, Im begging you, because I didnt, and you're just making shit up because anyone who's a Pats fan, or even someone who believes Brady is the GOAT is more likely to believe you than others.  I compared Rice to Moss/Gronk as all-time great talents, and I put Welker over Clark due to a higher amount of individual accolades and being a revolutionary at his position.  And thats funny, its something that a lot of Pats fans fail to see when they make idiotic arguments for Moss being definitely better than Rice in his prime, but drop when it hurts Brady.  I agree that Rice was better, but Brady had Moss/Gronk for more games.  And lol, I have been consistent saying Rice was better, if you're just comparing primes tho, Ive been consistent in saying Rice was only slightly better.

I did mention Roger Craig, so once again you choose to ignore what I said, and **directly lie for a 3rd time** when I mentioned Montana had a clear advantage at RB.

&gt;You ignored my point about adjusting recievers stats to era instead of looking at raw stats. You ignored my point about standard deviation. You ignored my point about using magnitude to compare the amount of games Moss and Gronk played with Brady, and the amount of games that Rice played with Montana instead of just using aggregate games. You also ignored my point about Rice putting up much much better stats than Gronk and Moss combined. And you also ignored other people's points about including Craig who was a very significant player in the 49ers offense during Montana's time, and about adjusting defensive rankings for a 32 team league because during the 49ers era the league only had 30 teams.

I never looked at raw stats, so that's false.  I countered standard deviation by showing that there wasnt that much of a difference in QBs then anyways.  What do you mean by magnitude, do you mean percentage of games played with? I responded by saying Edelman was still a greater factor than any other non Rice/Clark receiver.  And I fucking included Craig lol, stop lying repeatedly throughout the post.

&gt;No dude, you just put out a very poor and biased analysis and got all butt hurt when people pointed it out. It's as simple as that.

Nope, you chose to lie about what I said to make me look bad which is about as low as you can go.

7684,"Yeah I get that, but that's what I'm talking about, climbing you hidden MMR faster than your real one is a trick to push your win rate down and stop you climbing too fast. You're games are getting harder before you've climbed to the rank, so eventually you're gonna hit that point of a loss streak and balance that win rate out. 

Then again, I guess the only difference would be if they didn't do that would be climbing to the same rank anyway - you just get the visible MMR /SR for it, before you start getting super tough games and losing.

If they both climbed at the same rate, you'd climb much faster because your games get harder equivalent to how much you climb, as it is if you get a good winstreak the system goes 'woah woah woah slow down bud', and sticks a few people higher skill than you on each team to try and get you to fuck up. Obviously if you persevere, you keep climbing, but it's a bit unfair IMO. I'm never a fan of this 'you have to beat people above your rank just to get your rank' systems. League does a simillar thing. Get your silver promos with a 70% win rate? 'enjoy playing with 3 gold ranked players on the enemy team sucker. Try again with a 50.2% win rate instead and we might not punish you for climbing as harshly'.

She started showing her ability to manipulate and play her situation to her advantage back in season 2. She tiptoed around Joffrey, feigned her loyalty to him to Cersei and everyone else in KL because she knew she couldn't trust any of them and she had to play her cards right. I especially now look back on and love her treatment of Joffrey: goading him to go ""where the fighting is thickest"" to get himself killed in Blackwater, saving the Fool's life by appeasing to Joffrey's sadism, etc. 

Despite how much she's come to despise Littlefinger, her behavior in BotB makes a lot of sense. Yes, she was trying to outwit Ramsey, and yes she beat him at his own game. However, we have to keep in mind that she probably wasn't even positive that Littlefinger would come through with the Vale. She'd just rejected him and basically told him to GTFO. He could've just easily written her off as well, so she likely didn't tell Jon just in case he became hopeful for reinforcements that might not come. Add that to the fact that if Ramsey saw their army was bigger than his, he'd have bolted for Winterfell like the coward he was and waited them out. 

A lot of people seem to have a misconception about her motives during that episode. She wasn't needlessly trying to sacrifice men for no reason. People were bound to die, anyway. It's war. And if the Starks didn't reclaim Winterfell, then the War for the Dawn would be barely possible especially since I believe Winterfell is going to be the base of operations in a way. ",gameofthrones

He also then passed Aaron Rodgers as the team's leading rusher for the 2016 season.

7896,"Maybe try to find a guild that is progressing on normal first. Keep in mind it's only been two(maybe three?) weeks since ToS has released. There's is not that many guilds progressing through HC currently and the ones that are usually have a pretty setup member roster. So unless you get a lucky chance at an invite and/or a spot for a trial it'll be hard to join a guild that is already progressing HC. This is atleast what I've seen on my realm, which is not as highly populated as most realms(Anachronos-connected EU). That's just my opinion on it, maybe others will be able to post a better perspective of it. Good luck however! :)

Edit: Guilds that are recruiting also look at more than just your character IL or gear in general. They look for people that can perform like they actually have 907 gear, maybe even a bit higher. In my guild we have a few people in our HC progression team that are 900-903 IL but they pull 93+parses for their item level. So even if they only get 50-70 ranks on overal parses for that spec they still perform very well for their current gear. These are the recruits or members that our guild likes to put more effort into helping them gear up. When you're in Pugs try to pick up mechanics where other people fail them.  I.E: The robots on Trilliax in Nighthold. Even if that pull it's not your job to worry about the robots, actually helping out when and where you can and make the job easier for everyone in the group is what makes a person(especially dps) stand out. Doing this and picking up other people's slacks will get you noticed.

&gt; A candidate in Sunday&amp;#039;s assembly elections and an opposition activist have been killed in Venezuela.

&gt; Here in the capital, voting has got under way peacefully in many neighbourhoods but the election is unfolding amid a tense atmosphere.

&gt; Four months of protests against Mr Maduro and his plans for the assembly have left more than 100 people dead. The election has been heavily criticised by other Latin American countries as well as the European Union and the United States, which last week imposed new sanctions on members of Mr Maduro&amp;#039;s government.

There is no telling what would have happened had there never been a coup but I can't imagine having a popular leader who was elected would end worse than a dictator who oppressed the shiite's to the point where it boiled over into a revolution.

what a plot hole truly is, is an event in the plot that defies the logic laid down previously in the plot, or violates the laws of logic and physics that determine the universe in which the story takes place.

for instance people claim that Batman putting up a flaming bat signal on the bridge in TDKR is a plot hole for the simple fact that it takes too much time away from him fighting Bane to reclaim the city.... but that's not a plot hole.  waste of time? yes.  Necessary action?  No.  But.... it does not defy any laws of logic or physics...  there was nothing in the universe, or in the story, that already happened that should have prevented him from doing it........

now, a very small minor plothole can be seen in the Shawshank Redemption when the poster that hides the escape route it secured tightly on all 4 corners after Andy escapes.... that's not physically possible as Andy would be in the tunnel while reattaching it, and would be able to attach 3 corners, but not all 4.


So, yes, Edmure's fate would be a loose thread....


As for the people of Riverrun who ""currently don't have a Lord anymore""....  what people are these?  The soldiers that control Riverrun?  Nope, they're Lannisters.  If they're Freys, that's different.  If you mean the army of House Tully.... well their fate is unknown as they surrendered to Jaime on Edmure's orders.

&gt; .....Of BassBin Twins
Bassbin Twins were born in Los Angeles, moved to Belgium, and are now based in San Francisco. Started in 1992 simply because of a ""love for the beats"", they've recorded for Skint, Belgian Breaks, Southern Fried, and others, as well as their own numerous one off indpendent releases.

&gt; A live Bassbin Twins show is a remix of all their favorite music. Their innovative tunes range from breaks to house to drum 'n bass. Anything and everything can get woven into the mix. Eclectic in nature, the connection lies in the unique rub they put on each track.

&gt; The future for BBT holds more live shows, new fiercely independent record releases, and more film making projects. Read more on Last.fm.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I'm not 100% where it falls in Reddit's user agreement, having just skimmed it, but it seems that to ""participate"" in Reddit, you have to post or vote, and I don't think CNN did either of those things. IMO subreddits have the right to ban any links they want, but they can't 'ban' a person for reading someone's public posting history and reacting outside of reddit. I tried to find rules surrounding what a user can do outside reddit using knowledge they gain about a person inside reddit, but there don't appear to be any.  

Regardless, my distaste is for a subreddit to ban a news source in the /r/conspiracy forum based on defending the privacy of a racist, scummy persons' public posts. There is no guarantee of anonymity when using the internet, and you should be ready to own the things you say. I thought the video of Trump beating up 'cnn' was funny and no reason to doxx a person, but I think in general, the media has a right to report on shitty things people say on the internet.

My point is that QB Wins aren't *really* a thing. Rings are a **team accomplishment** and that in the actual metrics which we can compare, Aaron is so far ahead of the pack, Brady included, that the Rings argument shouldn't have any bearing and that such an argument really should only be given weight when the comparable metrics between two players is close.

The band currently consists of Mette Lindberg (vocals), Lars Iversen (bass, keys), Mikkel Baltser Dørig (guitar, keys), Miloud Carl Sabri (trumpet, keys) and Rasmus Valldorf (drums). Their debut album, Fruit was released in 2009 on their own Small Giants label. The band's single Around the Bend was featured in an iPod Touch commercial in December 2008.

I think they had this meeting with Steve Jobs himself, and he picked that song out of the bunch and said, 'This is it, this is the new track for the iPod Touch.' Apparently he just loved that track, but we never saw it as one of our singles. We have some other songs that we thought would be great singles, and that would work cool on for the radio, but he really loved that song."" 
 
The Asteroids reached instant global exposure when their song Around The Bend was featured in an Apple iPod Touch advert in late 2008. Their music also appeared in US hit TV series Gossip Girl, CSI Miami as well as Chuck.
Around The Bend was also chosen as one of the key tracks to the R.J. Cuttler documentary ""The September Issue"", based on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. 

&gt; Their song The Golden Age is featured in the latest Heineken advert The Entrance from 2011.

&gt; Their first show ever was as opening act for Amy Winehouse in their local Copenhagen and Katy Perry chose The Asteroids as opener for her European tour summer of 2009.
The band spend most of 2009 touring all around Europe and the US with their six piece live band which includes trumpet, saxophone, drums, guitar, keys, bass and more...

&gt; The press says:

&gt; Addictive quirky soulful Pop Music with attitude,
sweeping musical arrangements with one of the hippest vocals around, Known for their infectious live shows, shiny, shimmering, upbeat pop, albeit with a horn-infused, slightly psychadelic edge, C-walking, up rockin’ leg-splitting and hip-shaking their way through, infusion sound like no other,
effervescent music that reminds you of a dozen glorious summerskaleidoscopic monster, bubbly and hypnotic...

&gt; At the moment they are busy recording new material for future releases and getting ready for playing their ""FRUIT"" spring/summer tour around the world for festivals and club shows.

It necessitates a mutual economic dependency that makes it too painful to flip and deters autocratic tendencies. Maybe there will be a different framework for such an arrangement in the future, but right now EU membership is the only one that facilitates that.

8421,"Thank you. I stumbled across this theory last night, and thought I'd offer some explanation.

These so called ""accounts"" aren't real. That's why you're hearing non-stop about these transactions getting reversed. The reason that they appear to go through in the first place is that these people are attempting transactions with valid routing numbers for Federal Reserve and US Treasury banks.

Normally, when making a payment online with a checking account, the routing and account numbers are verified, and the transaction is sent to the bank. The Federal Reserve's routing numbers, however, are not consumer banks. I do not think that the account numbers are verified in the same way. The routing number is valid, and the transaction is sent to be processed.

When it hits the Fed's bank account, there are a few possibilities:

There is no such account number, so the transaction is reversed.

There is an account with that number, but because of name and address are incorrect it is declined and reversed.

There is an account with that number, it goes through. You've now committed interstate wire fraud.

In response to this, many websites and services have either started properly verifying the accounts, or are just completely blocking routing numbers from non-consumer government banks.

Anyone who has a solid understanding of ACH payment processing would see this immediately. These people offer absolutely no tangible evidence that there are actual accounts that are in their name, at least not that I've seen.

What really makes me sick is that there are people out there, who say they will help you access these alleged accounts for a fee. They're charging people money, and essentially stealing their personal information and using it for their personal gain. Absolutely disgusting.

I had never even thought about the possibility of this being use by our governments to identify people who hold certain beliefs. But you're right. You're literally handing your full name and SSN to a Federal Reserve bank and telling them that you've fallen for this BS propaganda.

Assuming someone has that mindset I just quoted, do you (who has that mindset, if you're reading this and want to respond) really want to be that much of an elitist that only people with the time and money to play WoW should be allowed to, and everyone else should just go fuck-off?

You said it yourself, there are plenty of games around besides WoW, much more so than before. So yeah, maybe WoW is not for everyone. 

I'm no elitist, in fact I speak as a casual who has always loved the game and has never had the time to invest enough in it to experience the ""high end game content"". I concede, WoW is not for me. I log in, do my emissary WQ and run a M+. I i'm stuck at 900 ilvl, which means i'm stuck at M+10 and LFR. Forget about being in a guild with strict raiding schedules and forget about puging at that ilvl. Forget about finishing a raid the same day I start it. I don't have 2 hours a day to play the game.

To be honest WoW requires a massive time commitment. It was worse before, granted, but still 2 hours a day is a MASSIVE amount of time for some people. WoW is for students, retirees, 9-5 people and freelancers. If you have an 80 hours a week high demand job and a wife, you don't get to play like 80% of the content. The key is to accept it instead longing for the game to adjust to your life schedule.

8563,"&gt;part of maritime law.

Why can't Italy deny landing to boats carrying illegal immigrants just like the French and the Spanish did and do?

&gt;They leave because they think that if they make to Italy and somehow don't get caught

Are concepts so difficult that different words carrying the same meaning confuse you? ""And somehow don't get caught"" = negligent and permissive behaviour that encourages illegal crossing.

&gt;This is an hipothesys that seems to make sense

Yes, that's been my point for the whole conversation.

&gt;the data I showed you and all the data I have ever seeen, in my opinion, show that the effect of our behaviour has no significant effect on crossing attempts.

You don't have the counterfactual case because Italy didn't deny landings.

&gt;What do you do?

I don't think it is the admiral who decides on foreign policy. If I were the minister of foreign affairs I'd probably tell the admiral to follow what Australians do under such circumstances. As I said, though, the best solution would be preventing boats carrying illegal immigrants from setting sail for Italy. In addition to this, the long-term solution would entail stabilising MENA, but that's probably beyond Italy's capabilities given that it isn't NATO's leader, even though it could do whatever it can to steer decision making within the alliance. Furthermore, relief programmes in Sub-Sahara should be reinforced and expanded.

At the end of the day, though, the very high birth rate, scarcity of resources (water alone in the near future will be an ever pressing issue) and conflicts will not be solved, and neither Italy nor Europe can take in hundreds of millions of desperate people. It is the harsh truth.",europe

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5270057948de473cc7b406f607daf419.png)  

&gt; Chico Buarque (born Francisco Buarque de Hollanda, 19 Jun 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - also known as Chico Buarque de Hollanda), is a singer, composer, dramatist, and writer, although he is best known for his music, which often comments on Brazilian social, economic &amp; cultural issues.

&gt; Chico came from an intellectual and privileged family background.  Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, his father, was a well-known historian and sociologist.  Aurélio Buarque de Hollanda, his lexicographer uncle, is as strongly associated with Brazilian dictionaries as Webster is with American English ones. 

&gt; He was a studious child, precocious in music &amp; writing, and was heavily impressed by bossa nova - specifically, João Gilberto's work.

&gt; Chico made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows. His self-titled debut album exemplified the work to come, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy.

&gt; Chico's increasing political activity against the Brazilian military dictatorship resulted in his arrest in 1968, and eventual self-exile to Italy in 1969. Other important musicians like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil experienced the same fate. Chico returned to Brazil in 1970, using his fame and song-writing skills to protest against the dictatorship. At this time his lightly-veiled protest single Apesar de Você (Despite you) somehow passed by the gaze of military censors, becoming the democracy movement's anthem. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually repressed, and all copies were removed from the market. Despite the censorship, songs such as Samba de Orly (Samba of Orly; 1970), Acorda Amor (Wake Up, Darling; 1974), and Vai Passar (It Will Pass; 1983) made Chico's continuing opposition blatant.

&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, Chico collaborated with filmmakers, playwriters, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship.

&gt; In 1998, the carnival samba school Mangueira took Chico as its annual theme, winning first prize.

&gt; His latest book, Budapeste, achieved great critical acclaim and won the Prêmio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award similar to The Booker Prize Award. Read more on Last.fm.

For example, you could probably bring a third tank to soak the extra Armageddon pretty easily and just rotate three tanks but then your losing dps which makes the entire fight harder.  Why not just stack immunities in that case.

I feel that blizzard designed the mechanics thinking people would take a third tank for many of the fights.  That seems almost like what they wanted people to do but instead people stacked immunities.",wow

8641,"Both South Korea and Japan spent decades under US occupation. Their very first constitutions were drafted under American supervision. I'm not sure how much agency did Japan or South Korea even have around 40s-60s in drafting any of their reforms.

And I can't think of many topics that they adopted from the West in conservatism department either. The Japanese were living under feudal rule well into the 19th century and then just went straight for ""make Japan great again"" that still persists to this day. Back in the 60s and 70s, they had all sorts of distinctly Japanese conservative movements, like the one led by Yukio Mishima.

I doubt many of them really give a shit about Smith or Burke ideas outside of academic circles. Here in the West people have centuries of Protestant thought and various French liberty movements that had been ingrained in peoples minds by now. In Asia, they had none of that. Any semblance of Western-like thinking is just that, a cherry-picked set of customs put there at various ""modernization"" periods that they went through and has fuck all to do with western religious or philosophical movements. It's purely cosmetic. It's not like they even need any of that. China has 5000 years of history to draw upon and half a century of building its own distinct brand of Communism. Japan has its glorious feudal and imperial days to reminisce about. One exception is perhaps Taiwan, which is not particularly conservative, but who also had come to these reforms naturally as opposed to having them installed under military occupation. I'd also expect them to drop the death penalty sooner than the other Asian countries, as they move away from the ideas they had during their period of military dictatorship.",europe

Not sure how this remark was ""sardonic"".  I'm curious how you can put a fixed time span on persons turning around their character.  Two years... because what?  He hasn't done anything douchey in two years?  What steps has he taken to amend his wrongs?  What actions has he done to contribute to society?  IIRC he even said something at the end of his Comedy Central Roast about him going to try to be a better person.  

Look at someone like Chris Brown.  Chris Brown has a laundry list of abuse.  I'm sure I don't have to remind you how he beat the shit out of then girlfriend Rihanna.  To those of you who think, ""no big deal""...
http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-brown-police-report-leaked-brown-continued-punch-rihanna-face-his-right-hand-while-steering

He beat the shit out of her because his girlfriend saw a text from another woman while they were driving.  Threatened to kill her.  Threatened to continue beating her after they got home.

Now, he's got a documentary out called ""Welcome to My Life"", showcasing all of trials and tribulations.  Poor guy. But its been 2 years since his last incident, so he's back to normal status.

This is one of thousand of examples throughout the decades across all genres of celebrity status.  If Bieber, Brown, Lennon, Jackson, West, etc. etc. didn't have their celebrity status, they'd be douche bags.  This worship of famous people for simply being famous normalizes poor and destructive behavior, make it seem like its not only OK, but often ""cool"" to their millions of fans.

I get it.  Do I feel for Bieber?  Sure do.  I did crazy stupid shit as a teen and young adult too.  If i had tons of money and women throwing themselves at me at his age, its very likely I'd have done the same shit.  But because I feel for him, because I understand his reasons, it doesn't make his behavior acceptable.  

Staying off the radar for two years or talking about how you will change in the future doesn't magically get rid of that vinegary smell.  Its about actions, about doing.  

What has he done with intent to show people he's not a douche, to show people that part of his life is in the past.  Nothing.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Solo queue rated BGs and possibly arenas. Right now PvP just is not really worth getting into for many people and letting them just queue up for it would increase participation massively (hopefully many people would get interested and then go play in the premade brackets too).

More optional stuff, like brawlers guild, proving grounds, mage tower challenge, pet/toy/mount collections, achieves. I like to complete things and feel like I have a goal. Doesn't necessarily have to be a solo activity. I already have a raiding guild who gets CE every tier, adding more stuff that I have to do to be raid ready is not fun imo and takes away time from things I like to do. I'm sure this will be the most controversial point though since it seems a lot of people need to be forced into doing content to have fun rather than just finding and doing things they enjoy.

Edit: I looked further down and wanna say that I also really want to have player housing. Not garrisons, but just a house instance you can go to and put trophies from stuff you've done in. End-raid boss kills could drop something to put in a room. PvP could add a graveyard outside with size depending on how many HKs we have, etc. Pets could move in.

&gt; Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.

&gt; Jackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as ""the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley"". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.

&gt; From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. 

&gt; Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.

&gt; On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.

&gt; In the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.

&gt; On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.

2. Matching with 1. The best time to try to hit your opponents with your abilities is when they move up to last hit, try to catch then in auto animation because it's much harder to dodge, or they'll have to miss the cs to do so.

&gt;ANTI-SEMITISM is defined as the spreading of enmity against the Jews. When the damnable Tsarist monarchy was living out its last hours, it attempted to divert the illiterate workers and peasants into pogroms against the Jews.

&gt;The Tsar’s police in union with the landlords and capitalists organised Jewish pogroms. They attempted to divert the natural hatred of the workers and peasants for the exploiters against the Jews.

&gt;Even in other countries one often experiences that the capitalists stir up enmity against the Jews, in order to divert the attention of the workers from the real enemy of the working masses, capital.

&gt;**Enmity against the Jews can only exist where the landowners and capitalists have kept the workers and peasants in complete illiteracy through bondage.**

&gt;Only entirely uneducated and completely oppressed people can believe the lies and slanders which are being spread about the Jews. These are survivals from the times of serfdom, when the priests burnt heretics at the stake, when peasants were trampled upon and were blind. But these dark survivals of serfdom are disappearing, the people are beginning to see.

&gt;It is not the Jews who are the enemies of the toilers. **The enemies of the workers are the capitalists of all lands.** Among the Jews there are workers, toilers, they are in the majority. They are our brothers, comrades in the struggle for Socialism, because they are oppressed by capitalism. Among the Jews there are Kulaks, exploiters, capitalists, **just like amongst us all.**

&gt;**The capitalists are tireless in their endeavours to stir up enmity between the workers of different faiths, different nations and different races. The rich Jews, just like the rich Russians and the rich of all countries, are united in trampling upon, oppressing and dividing the workers.**

&gt;Disgrace and infamy to the damnable Tsarism which tortured and persecuted the Jews! Disgrace and infamy to whoever sows enmity against Jews and hatred against other nations! Long live brotherly faith and unity in struggle of all nations, for the overthrow of capitalism!

*- Vladimir Lenin, from a gramophone record made during the Civil War, in 1919.* 

&gt;There remains that universal historical tendency of capitalism to smash down national barriers, to erase national differences, to assimilate nations, which with each decade shows itself more powerfully, and which constitutes one of the greatest motive forces transforming capitalism into socialism.

&gt;He who does not acknowledge and defend the equality of nations and languages, he who does not fight against all forms of national oppression or inequality, is not a Marxist nor even a democrat. That is certain. But it is just as certain that he who pretends to be a Marxist, but violently attacks the Marxist of another nation or “assimilation” in practice, is just a petty bourgeois nationalist. . . .

&gt;The people who are shouting most against the “assimilationism” of the Russian orthodox Marxists4 are the Jewish nationalists in Russia, and in particular the Bundists. Yet, as can be seen from previously quoted figures, out of 10½ million Jews in the world about half live in the civilized world, in conditions of the greatest “assimilation,” while only the unfortunate, downtrodden, outlaw Jews of Russia and Galicia (crushed by the Purishkeviches, Russian and Polish), live in conditions of the least “assimilation,” the greatest segregation, including “Pales,” “percentage standards,” and other reactionary delights.

&gt;The Jews in the civilised world are not a nation, they have become most of all assimilated, affirm Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer. The Jews in Galicia and Russia are not a nation, they unfortunately (and not through their fault, but owing to the Purishkeviches) are still a caste. This is the unquestioned conclusion of people who are unquestionably well informed in the history of the Jews.

&gt;What do these facts indicate? They indicate that “assimilation” can be denounced only by the Jewish reactionary petty bourgeois, who wish to turn back the wheel of history, and to force it to move, not from the conditions of Russia and Galicia to the conditions of Paris and New York, but in the opposite direction. . . .

a lot of people felt drake ""phoned in"" his verses and features on this project (even more so on the newly released track, ""Signs"") so this was a way of extracting the lifeless drake vocals &amp; highlighting the strengths of this project.

8921,"I'll address all your points individually, but I honestly believe there is nothing that I can say that will change your mind. You seem to be entrenched in the belief that the DNC is not responsible for that loss.  Here it goes.  
.  
One - regarding Clinton's popular vote victory: this is completely to be expected. Most of the country's population is concentrated in or around major cities. Most of America's largest cities lean left. Source : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_the_50_largest_cities_in_the_United_States . So the whole popular vote thing should be no surprise, as you seem to indicate. The guys at the DNC know the rules of the game. They knew the popular vote is worth Jack shit. It's about winning as many States as you can. Clinton was not the right choice to win over as many swing States as possible.  
.  
Two - about Trump being the worse candidate and therefore a "" no brainer"" election : An election is never about facts. It is about perception. The guys at the DNC know this. Yet they still ran one of the most unpopular Democratic candidate in history. That's on them. Source https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/  
.  
Third - on the idea that the media portrayed Trump and Hillary as equally bad: That's just evidence of how shitty Clinton was as a candidate. No other Democrat would have been able to be painted as equally bad as Trump EXCEPT Hillary Clinton. She was a bag of damaged goods that came with a ton of baggage. The DNC knew this, but again got caught up in the hubris of ""there's no way she can lose against Trump"". Running a candidate that could so easily be portrayed in a negative light is on them.

Watching in the theater is more about going out, it's a bit more of an event, the quality of picture and sound can be better (depending on the theater and the home setup), and at least for now, you get to watch newer movies.

I'm pretty sure both preferences are strongly present in the market - enough to warrant offering movie fans the choice (with movies screening in theaters and at home at the same time), instead of theaters having a monopoly on new movies. I say let the consumer choose - theaters will end up with the audience that specifically wants to be there, which should be enough for them to survive (though possibly in downsized form). And movie studios can make good money from theaters and from streaming home release, if the business model is well thought out.

I don't think big studios will be quick to work with Netflix for new movies, but over time, and with Netflix offering the right price / business model (like a per-movie fee or premium subscription that works for all parties), it may happen. Or another party, like a consortium of movie studios or another third party besides Netflix could get it done at some point. The theater-only window is anti-choice and archaic in my opinion, even though I have nothing against the theater and go several times a year. I'd just like to choose for myself for every movie.",movies

And Russell Wilson has consistently played well behind what has consistently been bottom-of-the-league pass protection, and has missed a whopping total of *two* snaps due to injury in his career. 

I think Stafford, Wilson, and Luck (and Ryan and possibly Cousins) are all interchangeable if you're ranking QBs and they've all proven to be great, but I don't see the point in discrediting one or the other for bullshit reasons like the ones you've given. RW has had a better roster around him and better coaching, yes, but that's also why he's won so many more games and why his career efficiency numbers blow others' out of the water.

That's simply illogical, you do something so that something would happen otherwise, why do it?



And I finally understood what you mean by ""trust"". We in the real world call it ""influence"". US has influence over Israel, Saudis, Europe and as such US doesn't care about what they do. 

On the other hand, US will use all the weapons in its arsenal against countries who they don't have influence over and who happen to have interests which do not align with US interests. They will use actual weapons against countries who will not be able to retaliate militarily, it will use economic weapons against countries who will not be able to retaliate economically... So it's not about ""right and wrong"", it's about influence. I think we are pretty much in agreement on this one. 

And hence, as I said initially, Russia should just ignore US and continue to pursue its interests, the only other option is to blindly follow US.  The good thing for Russia though, is that its goal of the multipolar world is closer and closer, US' influence is decreasing, they will soon reach parity with China. EU is starting to pursue more independent policy. And Russia is re-establishing it self as a crucial player not only near its borders but also in other parts of the world.",europe

&gt; Sabac Red is a former member of the underground hip-hop group Non Phixion, born in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. His family moved to Brooklyn, NY when he was 4 years old.

&gt; Sabac began his journey into hip-hop as a b-boy and aspiring graffiti artist. At the age of 12 Sabac began exploring the art of emceeing. He would listen to the mix shows and memorize other MCs' lyrics. He would then make parodies of the song's using his own lyrics. Sabac would perform at block parties, school talent shows and anywhere there was music and a mic constantly battling other MCs and nurturing his craft.

&gt; While a freshman at Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, NY Sabac would promote parties and shows for artists such as Milk and Gizmo, Big Daddy Kane, Greg Nice and many other hip-hop legends.

&gt; While in school, Sabac found himself getting into trouble with the law. He had to do community service at the CityKids Foundation (http://www.citykids.org) where he ended up learning how to use his lyrics to express his pain and the things that were going on around him. He received training in Facilitation, Conflict Management, Public Speaking, Curriculum Design/ Implementation and much more. CityKids was and still is a place that develops young artists and leaders.

&gt; With help from his mentors Malik Yoba, Jamal Joseph and Alex Atkinson, Sabac had the opportunity to learn, create and grow with his peers who have become some of today's very successful artists including: Dash Mihok, Donald Fasion, Lauren Hill, Dule Hill, Mario Vasquez, and many more. Sabac began working at CityKids between school, touring and odd jobs. He worked his way up to become The Director of Programs at The CityKids Foundation. Sabac resigned from CityKids in 2004 to tour and continue to work on music.

&gt; After high school, Sabac went to recording engineering school where he got a degree in recording engineering. Sabac went on to work for Wild Pitch Records as the College Radio promoter. He also did street promotion for Nas' Illmatic and a number of artists in the 90s.

&gt; In 1995 Sabac hooked up with Ill Bill and there begin the relationship of what is now the legacy of Non Phixion. Non-Phixion was Ill Bill, Sabac Red, Goretex and DJ Eclipse. The group began to put out music independently and began touring the world on their own. Sabac Red and Non Phixion have performed in all of NYC's major venues and have done shows all over the world. Some of the groups Sabac and Non Phixion have shared the stage with include Gang Starr, Run DMC, Wu-Tang Clan, Rage Against the Machine, Mos Def, Hazen St., Ludacris, Black Moon, Boot Camp Click, Pharaoh Monch, Big Pun and Fat Joe, Cypress Hill, Necro, Q-Unique, The Beatnuts, Jurassic 5, Lordz of Brooklyn, Dead Prez, Beastie Boys &amp; The Roots and Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks. In 2006 Non-Phixion called it quits although Sabac Red, Ill Bill and DJ eclipse will continue to work together on all upcoming projects.

&gt; Sabac released his debut solo album Sabacolypse ""A Change Gon' Come"" on the independent Psycho+ Logical- Records in June 2004. The album received great reviews and continues to sell units worldwide. In 2005 Sabac put out two powerful Mix CD's titled ""Freestyle and Demos Vol. 1"" and ""Sabac Red Presents The Collabo Collection Vol. 1"".

&gt; In 2005 Sabac moved to Oakland, California where he continues to lead workshops and train young people and adults.

&gt; Sabac is currently performing solo shows around the world as well as working on his next solo project, a CD/DVD Titled ""The Ritual"" due out 2007. He is also finishing up The Collabo Collection Vol. 2, which will be released right before ""The Ritual"". Sabac is planning a world tour for 2007 including places like Brazil, South Africa, South America and Australia.

&gt; Sabac Red is also the Academic Liaison for the Alameda Unified School District's R.I.S.E/Jetsetters program and designs curricula for middle and high school students. Read more on Last.fm.

Oh and one more peice of advice, the biggest hurdle for pain after surgery is the capillaries making new routes through incision as it heals. So if you keep your leg up too much, the blood pressure hurts too much when you put your leg down, so alternate and put your leg down frequently if you can handle pain. It will ease the transition in healing better.

This is part of a war with the militant terrorist group ISIS. And as in any war, there are going to be civilian casualties right? I understand that the military could do a better job in preserving civilian lives but during the Obama administration there was an executive order which sought to

9055,"Assuming that the two events happened in the same time period (episodes can cover events over many months) the Lannister/Greyjoy fleet would not have the strength to attack Dany's fleet and therefore wouldn't attempt to when they have a city and a defendable port to hole up in. One has to to put the strength of the two fleets in perspective to truly get a grip on the strategies employed by both sides. 

1) The Iron fleet numbers one hundred ships according to the wiki, weather this is with or without bannermen is unknown so for the sake of this speculation I'll assume it's with because many ironborn are sailing with Dany. One hundred ships is a huge armada (The Spanish armada consisted 130 ships) and if we're going of the base that the average historical combat longship has 20-30 rowing benches each sitting four people we could say that the iron fleet is 8,000-12,000 sailors strong. These sailors are some of the best marines and boarding specialists in the world and are experts in naval warfare.

2) Dany's fleet is large enough to transport roughly 100,000 dothraki and their horses, as well as 8,000 unsullied, and I'll estimate 5,000 ironborn. They obviously aren't using the same ships but to put it in perspective thats about 942 of the largest historical longships without the horses in the equation. Plus dragons and the Dornish fleet that will probably link up with Dany.

So the idea of the lannister/greyjoy fleet attempting to engage Dany's fleet is insane. Aegon conquered Westeros with around 1,600 men and three dragons. Ships are wooden; dragons breathe fire. The greyjoy fleet will get smacked by Dany. Even if Dany had no dragons she would win the naval battle. She would take enormous casualties due to the greyjoys being naval experts and it might be enough to make her lose the war farther down the road, but she would still make landing at dragonstone with a sizable army. The cost far outweighs the reward because Cersei needs all the troops she can get to hold against the rest of the seven kingdoms. The greyjoy attack would be an effective suicide charge without the dragons. With the dragons it would be similar to the charge of the light brigade. Extreme cost for no payoff.",gameofthrones

I have a question though, on principle what's wrong with a regulated free market with social services as an underlying stabilizing force?

We must realize as an emergent form industry will always fight state ownership, so why not build a system from the ground up that regulates the market rather than just takes it over?

To me, socialists, social democrats, democratic socialists, and liberals are all united by two common enemies; neo-liberalism (which masquerades as ""modern liberalism"", but is in fact hard right conservatism on par with the 1980's....as Francis Fukuyama found out when he realized that PNAC and the neo-con/neo-libs manipulated his theory in ""End of History"" to justify american fiscal (rather than ethical) hegemony)...and neo-conservatism.  Both of which we can only beat as a unified liberal base (as the last election showed). 


I guess my question to you becomes; why can't all rational social leftists accept John Rawls (Political Liberalism/Law of Peoples Rawls, not Theory of Justice Rawls) as the happy medium which will allow (at least in America) the party to unite behind a core moral/ethical maxim as to the markets and actually take back power in 2020 with Warren?",trees

These were not necessarily condemned at the time however, nor were the initial intentions of the system totally awful.

This is me making my own moral judgement, but I don't think I hold him necessarily responsible for the faults of a school system that persisted for the better part of a century, the majority of which occurred after his death. Although there were systemic issues to be sure, the majority of abuses at these schools fell at the feet of individuals, and individual administrations at individual schools.

We claim credit for making significant contributions to the early development of hockey, basketball and football.

As one of the most important cities in the Americas, Montreal was on the cutting edge of the popularization of professional sports in the later 19th century.

We had a summer Olympics (although we're not especially proud of that one).

A hockey riot in 1955 is considered to be a turning point in our history.

Historically the best team in hockey.

Jackie Robinson.

Finally (and this is just my personal opinion) I think Montreal's the best place in the world to watch soccer on TV.  Unlike most other North American cities, Montreal loves soccer.  Fans of every team in the world live here and no team or nation has preponderance.  During the World Cup, you can watch almost any national team at a bar where you'll be surrounded by people (and supporters) of that nation.  If you're a soccer fan, I recommend visiting us during the next World Cup.  Hell, visit us for the next El Classico.

If you have Shaw WideOpen with 150/15 Mbps down and up, that is considered your last mile connection from your ISP to you.  That connection is mostly what you pay for.  Your actual connection to the Internet (from the ISP to other ISPs, on what is called backhaul, trunk, or a few other things), is what that $3-5/Mbps pays for.

It's hard to calculate actually what it costs, because everyone shares that connection.  

Now if that Shaw Wideopen customer shares his connection with 10,000 other people, and the ISP has a 30 Gbps fibre connection to the next ""node"" for Internet, that means everyone is entitled to 3 Mbps, but because nobody ever uses their full connection (due to so many reasons, including protocols and physics), you can get up to 150 Mbps download.

Your portion of your bill for that 3 Mbps ""share"" costs the ISP around $15, but then another $30-40-ish for everything else (cable connection to home, install, upgrades, phone support, licensing, etc).

I used 3 Mbps, as if you download at full speed for 30 days, and upload at 1/10th that, then you can move a maximum of 1TB total data, which happens to be their data cap :)

9281,"Some of my relatives on my maternal grandfathers side have done allot of research in to the family history and there are allot of fucked up stories. Here is the most fucked up one. 

In our family, way back probably around the 19th century, there was man, he was a widower and he had very many children. A few years after his first wife's death he married a very beautiful young woman. Together they had more children. 
After a few years they had too many children and his savings where starting to diminish. He decided that he was not going to share the marriage bed with her, but she was still very beautiful and he could not resist. So she bore him another child. No matter how hard he tried he could not stay away from her. 
Finally he asked a priest for advice on how to resist the sinful desires (at that time sex for any other reasons then procreation was considered sinful). The priest gave him the advice to read the Bible every night. The man did what he was told, but it was still hard to resist and another child was born. Then he found the solution in the bible. He went to the kitchen, found a knife and cut his manhood of. 
He was taken to the doctor and when the doctor asked why he did it he explained his problem and then quoted the bible: 
Matthew (18:8) ""If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."" 
This story is now written down in a genealogy book about my family.

This has always been far more than a simple question of Omar Khadr's rights as a citizen, or his rights as a human being under international law.  This has been a test of the Canadian principles which underpin those rights, and whether or not those Canadians will uphold and defend those principles.

Khadr is a Canadian citizen.  He always has been.  What does that mean? Traditionally, that has meant that Khadr would be brought before a judge, formally presented with the crimes against him, granted access to competent legal council and permitted to defend himself against those charges.  Instead, Khadr was denied those rights, and he was tortured by the Americans, with his government's consent.  

Canadians have been debating whether they will have the courage to stand by our principles, when those principles are challenged ... or whether we'll abandon them easily, without resistance. For the sake of expediency. Out of fear. 

We defend our own rights, liberties, and dignity whenever we protect those who we may not even feel deserve them, especially those who are powerless to defend themselves.

&gt; Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott (born January 20, 1995), better known by his stage name Joey Badass (stylised as Joey Bada$$), is an American rapper, producer and artist from Brooklyn, New York. He is a member of the hip hop collective Pro Era, with whom he has released three mixtapes. Joey released his debut mixtape 1999 on June 12 2012.  Featuring production from other Pro Era members, as well as some J Dilla and MF DOOM beats, the tape was released to general critical acclaim.  On September 6, Joey released Rejex, a collection of early versions of songs and tracks that didn't make it onto his debut. After his initial effort's resounding success, on July 1, 2013, Joey Bada$$ released his second mixtape, Summer Knights. He then released his debut album B4.Da.$$ on January 20, 2015, on his 20th birthday. Read more on Last.fm.

It would require an upheaval of human civilization and a radical shift of consciousness. A shift so drastic it's even questionable if it's possible for consciousness as we understand it to exist devoid of the current method of perception.

I get the starry-eyed idealism of Star Trek and the post scarcity egalitarian future it portrays for humanity. I want that too. It's great to have dreams, even those that are unattainable can give us the hope of the unknown. But at some point reality must be obeyed. And reality as it is perceived by human consciousness right now is a classification system based on pattern matching. 

Any competition creates disparity which creates class divisions. Even without competition there will always be disparity created by natural physical differences. Disparity is simply a difference between outcomes.

Try as I might I will never run as fast as Usain Bolt. I could have started training at birth and trained harder and more frequently than he has. There are physiological differences one of them being a small but substantial difference in the size, shape, and I believe fiber consistency of our gluteus muscles that will make it so I can never be his equal. If we each ran a mile he'd win by a long shot and even if we weren't competing those numbers would exist and they would create a disparity. Differences and their resulting disparity will create classes of people.

What you are talking for is equity or the equality of outcome. Where we must handicap the exceptional among us to create parity with masses. This is collectivist, taking away from the individual to give to the collective.

What I push for is equality or the equality of opportunity, egalitarianism and meritocracy. This is individualism, to each their own.  

Under the definition of left and right that I gave, that would make equity the left side of the equation and equality the right side of the equation and the center would be neither equity nor equality, but any mix in between.

The beauty of the definition I am using is that you can apply it to any issue individually with the same level of consistency that it is applied to the greater context of the three primary axis of Governance, Economics, and Social Policy.  

If you think of everything in politics in terms of taking authority from individuals and giving it to a collective you can more easily define positions and place yourself along the axis.  

And what makes my definition the most correct? Besides the logical consistency, transparency, and easy of use? It does not making any judgements on the morality of either side and it leaves the judgement up to each person deciding their place on the spectrum. 

As opposed to all of the definitions that have been spouted in this thread that boil down to nothing more than ""everything I support is left and everything evil in the world is right."" Which is the most absurd, egotistical, self-righteous, self-centered, and lazy method of addressing political discourse imaginable.

It can create some uncomfortable realizations for those that cling to claims of moral superiority as the defining part of their political identity; but only in places where there was already a massive amount of cognitive dissonance in the first place.",worldnews

Good news. Technically we can't be wrong. Mold is the American and Mould is the British spelling for both.  Bad news. Because both spellings are right people will use them interchangeably and inconsistently. We had actual heated arguments between departments about this.

&gt;Kim also said that she’s never seen “any violence whatsoever,” although the BuzzFeed story alleged that he slapped one woman with an open hand for being too friendly to a Subway employee. But she vividly remembers a bizarre punishment one of the girls, a 19-year-old, was subjected to when she didn’t perform sexually in the way Kelly expected.

&gt;Kim said that she and the girl were instructed by Kelly to “take off your clothes and act like you miss each other.” He got out his iPad and started filming, she said, but was dissatisfied by the 19-year-old’s performance. He told Kim to sit on the couch and took the 19-year-old into another room. Twenty minutes later, he called Kim in. Kim knocked in the proper way, then walked in to find the younger girl nude except for one of Kelly’s bigger pieces of jewelry, a heavy chain.

&gt;“He had his iPad recording and she was naked except for a big chain and she was running laps from one end of the room to the other,” Kim remembers. “She was running laps around the room and apologizing. She kept saying, ‘I’ve been bad, I’m sorry Daddy,’ shit like that. And I’m standing there and she starts apologizing to me.”

Lets not forget that:

-R.Kelly married Aaliyah when she was 15 years old and he was damn near 30.

-He has a violent criminal history (he has battery charges against him)

-Has multiple allegations against him for sex with minors and has been sued for sexual harassment.

-Had multiple charges against him for child pornography (which were dropped because the search of his property that led to the images being uncovered was deemed illegal). 

-And was just sued this year for having an affair with the wife of a Mississippi sheriff's deputy.",Music

9571,"&gt; Faure [President of France] died suddenly from apoplexy in the Élysée Palace on 16 February 1899, while engaged in sexual activities in his office with 30-year-old Marguerite Steinheil. It has been widely reported that Felix Faure had his fatal seizure while Steinheil was fellating him, but the exact nature of their sexual intercourse is unknown and such reports may have stemmed from various *jeux de mots* (puns) made up afterward by his political opponents. One such pun was to nickname Mme Steinheil ""*la pompe funèbre*"" (wordplay in French: ""*pompes funèbres*"" means ""death care business"" and ""*pompe funèbre*"" could be translated, literally, as ""funeral pump""). George Clemenceau's epitaph of Faure, in the same trend, was ""*Il voulait être César, il ne fut que Pompée*"" (another wordplay in French; could mean both ""he wished to be Caesar, but ended up as Pompey"", or ""he wished to be Caesar and ended up being blown"": the verb ""*pomper*"" in French is also slang for performing oral sex on a man); Clemenceau, who was also editor of the newspaper *L'Aurore*, wrote that ""upon entering the void, he [Faure] must have felt at home"". After his death, some alleged extracts from his private journals, dealing with French policy, were published in the Paris press.

The main difference with Raimi's is that his *friends* were actually decent people who didn't immediately flip out for the sake of creating drama.

9692,"kimbrel is ahead of hoffman in most non counting stats. era, era+, whip, fip, h/9, hr/9, k/9, and k/bb. he also leads hoffman in most of these by a mile. hoffman had 2 full seasons where he posted an era+ of over 200, whereas kimbrel has only finished below 200 in 3 out of his 8 seasons. 

kimbrel pitches in an average 68 games per 162 game season, has put up 16.8 total WAR and averages about 2.5 WAR in each season. hoffman also averaged 68 games per season and put up 28 WAR, or about 1.8 WAR per season. thats an average of .7 WAR more per season, or almost an additional 40 percent of hoffman's yearly WAR. thats huge for pitchers who generally only throw one inning and who accumulate so few innings per year.

kimbrel obviously has an astronomically far way to go to be considered the best closer of all time, but at the rate he's gong, he will be in the conversation in a few years if he doesn't have a drop off in production. my one concern with kimbrel is his longevity. pitchers like mariano and hoffman were able to keep their careers going long after their pitch velocity started to drop, and kimbrel definitely relies heavily on his overpowering speed. he also does not have the control that mo or hoffman had, and has a bb/9 of 3.4, where mariano's was 2.0 and hoffman's was 2.5 (this is one of the only rate stats where hoffman is better than kimbrel).

if you still really care about saves, you still better prepare yourself for a future that will probably still be full of arguments of kimbrel vs *insert historically good reliever here* because of the insane save rate kimbrel has had since he started pitching. in hoffman's first 7 seasons as a closer, he accumulated 266 saves in 491.1 innings. (he also saved 10 games over 180 innings in his first 3 seasons as a non closing reliever). in mariano's first 7 seasons he saved 278 games over 475 innings. (he also saved 5 games over 175 innings in his first 2 seasons as a non closing reliever). in kimbrel's first 7 seasons he's so far saved 280 games in 423 innings and only has one other save in the year before his rookie season where he pitched 20 innings. 

this means that kimbrel has a very very small lead in saves over mariano and hoffman at the same point in each of their careers. he will probably add a bit to that lead before the end of the season, but he's still far from what i would call having a ""comfortable"" lead. he's also pitched a ton less innings than the other two closers did in that time, basically an entire season of innings less than either of them. this bodes well for kimbrel as its a lot less stress put on his arm early in his career. the biggest advantage that kimbrel has though, is age. through their 7 full seasons as a closer, hoffman was 32, mariano was 33, *and kimbrel still isn't turning 30 until next year*. he's 3 full seasons (at his rate 120 saves) ahead of hoffman and 4 full seasons (160 saves) ahead of mariano. if he keeps up his career average of 40 saves per season, he'll reach 600 in 8 years (when he's still 37) and pass mariano by the time he turns 39. this is definitely not a sure thing, as injuries and down years happen all the time, but if kimbrel can find a way to maintain his healthiness, improve control, be on a decent teams, and not lose too much velocity, then i can definitely see him being crowned the new saves leader before he retires. remember that hoffman pitched until he was 42 and mariano until he was 43. its remarkable that each of them were able to remain so productive until so late in their careers, but the head start that kimbrel got on each of them still puts the 600 save club exclusivity in danger of acquiring a new member.",baseball

9842,"As a first baseman Howard's WAR was never going to highlight his value as a hitter. He was still a consistent 120+ wrC+ hitter with plenty of power left before his injury. Sabermetrics may have proved still that Howard was overrated given that he was seen as a much bigger impact bat than he was, but that doesn't mean he didn't have meaningful value anyway. 

Also remember that other first baseman were being resigned at that time too. Prince Fielder, Joey Votto, and Albert Pujols all eventually extended/resigned/signed significantly larger deals than Howard that same offseason (Howard resigned during the season iirc, before his injury). While Howard may have had the Subway-commercial star power of those actual premier first baseman, the difference in their contracts definitely exemplified their difference in expected production from 2012 onward, even if Howard made more up front. 

You bring up a good point that Howard still had 2 years of team control, but for RAJ to fully commit to the team as it was, first base needed to be filled for that window. Howard's contract was likely going to have an ugly end if he didn't have his achilles injury anyway, however, Ruin Tomorrow Jr. had already committed to an aging Roy Halladay and Ibanez, and in one 365 day period resigned Howard, Rollins, Utley, Hamels, and nabbed Papelbon in FA (all while the team completely fell apart in 2012 and RAJ decided to go all-in anyway). In committing to that likely historically awful plan, Howard's extension compared to his contemporaries wasn't as bad as hindsight currently makes it. 

Lastly, fuck Ruben Amaro Jr. Fuck him so hard.

Last time there were riots on the mount, Israel and Jordan reached an agreement regarding placing security cameras in the place, but Jordan at the last moment rejected it because they didn't agree to the manner of their operation.  
This alone should already be enough for the Waqf to actively start looking for weapons stashed on the site.  
The Waqf didn't do that, despite Israel's trust (for lack of better word) in them.  
So now, Israel has no choice but to take security measures into its own hands, because the Waqf obviously can't be trusted.  

There's no way to hide it behind ""buts"" and ""ifs"" - the Waqf has no interest in actually maintaining security, either because they agree with the cause, or because they don't want to harm relations with West Bank Palestinians. Either way, it's not in their interest because they know they aren't going to be harmed by it in any way. Much safer to just let Israel take the brunt of the criticism, as it always does.  

As for your previous questions - Jews have to go through metal detectors not only when entering the Western Wall, but also when going through the *only* gate allocated to non-Muslims to the Temple Mount.

What's interesting about this, is that it raises questions about the source of the DNC leaks, and weakens the Clinton Campaign's charge that those emails were obtained through Russian hacking.  Sure, we know that the Russians wanted to help Donald, and we know that Comey raised his concerns about Russian attempts to hack, but in terms of concrete evidence regarding a hack, there hasn't been a ""smoking gun"".

In the meantime, there are many questions regarding the security of the Clinton campaign/DNC emails, her issues with server/security and now we find that their top IT guy had a very interesting background, connections, and financial entanglements and was attempting to escape incarceration by leaving the country.

I'm a progressive, and I agree with many that Trump has unsavory financial ties with Russia that need to be uncovered.  However, there has not yet been any conclusive evidence that the Russians hacked the DNC emails.

9945,"&gt; And you can go back thousand, million, billion of years to find the supremacy of the stronger over the weaker. This obsession socialists have with capitalism in particular even though it dramatically reduced poverty globally is quite amusing.

Maybe that's news for you, but socialists do praise capitalism as some new era. Global poverty is being reduced through the world history, that's nothing particular to capitalism but it's about tech and science.

&gt; Of course, socialist-inspired rulers are always incompetent when socialism implementation attempt inevitably fails. Up until failure it is real socialism.

Nobody sees North Korea as socialist, including North Korea itself...

&gt; Stalin was comparable or worse than Hitler (and yet commemorating the former isn't a crime).

It's a crime in some countries, like commemorating Hitler isn't in some. That being said, I can count you numerous genocidal maniacs or war criminals, who are regarded as heroes even starting with Churchill or American generals who genocided natives.

&gt; No, there is not nor was a single State that is ""really socialist"" (right?). 

China is capitalist, and that's not even an argument. If you're thinking that it's socialism, I can't see even a point to argue here.

&gt; After China ditched socialism as economic model and adopted capitalism in the 80s it dramatically improved.

In the expense of its own people. It's true though, and now China shows what a real successful capitalism needs, a Stalinist dictatorship.

&gt; So far it never happened. In practice socialism implementation attempts invariably lead to tyranny, serfdom, misery, suffering, death.

Again, that was also true for secularism and democracy. Every revolutionary movement is fated to see going backwards and counter-revolution winning, old system or even worse restored until it succeeds. Otherwise, we should have let go of democracy and secularism as well.

Edit: For those of you [idiots] that are down voting me, are you honestly going to argue with science?

Emphysema is when the lungs lose their ability to recoil elastically when exhaling, also meaning that the lungs are more compliant, which causes the lungs to hyper-inflate, and the total lung capacity to increase above normal.

Cigarette smoke is the primary (and by a great percentage) cause of emphysema. The other known cause is to be that of having an alpha-1-AT deficiency. AAT deficiency increases the risk of developing emphysema, as the lungs are not as well protected from the infections that could arise as a result of tobacco smoke and other irritants.

Even if AW had AAT deficiency, the emphysema was still a result of her own behaviors and habits.",Music

10017,"**Definition of Euroscepticism**

Euroscepticism (also known as EU-scepticism, from the Greek word scepsis meaning doubt) means criticism of the European Union (EU). Some observers, however, prefer to understand opposition to and total rejection of the EU (anti-EU-ism) as 'Euroscepticism'.

Traditionally, the main source of Euroscepticism has been the notion that integration weakens the nation state, and a desire to slow, halt or reverse integration within the EU. Other views often held by Eurosceptics include perceptions of a democratic deficit in the European Union or a belief that the EU is too bureaucratic. **Euroscepticism should not be confused with anti-Europeanism**, which refers to the rejection of the culture of Europe and Europeanisation, and sentiments, opinions and discrimination against European ethnic groups.

------

**Foreign policy of PiS**

On foreign policy, PiS is Atlanticist and less supportive of European integration than Civic Platform. The party is soft eurosceptic, and opposes a federal Europe. In its campaigns, it emphasises that the European Union should 'benefit Poland and not the other way around'. It is a member of the anti-federalist Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists, having previously been a part of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations and, before that, the European People's Party.",europe

In Estonia we have some female conscripts, but we didn't have any in my battalion simply because we didn't have room for them - women would require their own barracks, showers etc... building those would mean a significant extra cost for the military. Money we don't have or sure as hell could spend more wisely.

Your anecdotal evidence aside, you can't deny the fact vast, overwhelming majority of men are a lot stronger than women. We had a doors open day where we showed some of our equipment and most girls that tried couldn't even lift a Carl Gustav launcher properly (the older M2 model). Now imagine them, in full gear, having to actually operate a CG or an MG for an extended
period of time. Not going to happen.

The military is a very demanding and a high-stress environment. Adding women to it would only make matters worse. Especially today, when every joke, slight or a bit of criticism aimed at a woman or her competence could result in a full-blown sexism scandal. The military has enough on it's plate as it is, it doesn't need headaches like that.

And finally, women themselves don't want to be in the military. What do you think would happen if we told girls they have to take a year off from clubbing and uni life and trade it for a year full of sweat and mud? They'd just leave the country *en masse*. Estonia is bleeding young women like crazy as it is, we can't afford to lose even more.

So like I've said, if there are women who are eager to join, all doors are open to them. However pressing large numbers of girls into military by force would only result in having weaker soldiers at a higher cost, headaches and social problems. Not to mention, not every citizen must be a reservist. You can build up more than a decent reserve from men alone. If anything, we should be streamlining the current system, not pressing women into it.",europe

With what you have as the character he definitely could have a flaw or two to make him more relatable (side note: How the hell is relatable marked as being misspelled?!

I will be the first to admit, though, that the whole being able to predict where the sandworm-things would pop out was a bit much. Everything else he's done has fallen into his general conceptual design.

While writing this I happened to reexamine the character and what he'd done from the beginning, and if you're looking for flaws of any kind I think I good one is that he overestimates what he's able to do consistently.

Germany borrowed a shitload of money after the war as well, and it too could not pay it back. Half of the debt had to be erased outright and the other half to be repaid after many decades exactly because the allies saw that Germany could not repay it, which worked cause in the meanwhile Germany started developing and it reached a point where it was in a position to start repaying.

Asking for your money to be returned immediately and imposing austerity, only ensures that people either won't have the money to repay you, or they will repay you but they won't have money to get by which beats the very purpose of borrowing money in the first place.

10244,"&gt; You Poles are slapping everyone in the EU in the face by cutting down a UNESCO World Heritage Site...

Wait a minute.  Whether or not this is a good idea, how is this an insult to the EU?

I could understand if the EU had some sort of special tie-in, like ""we have a common EU national park fund, and you're mowing down something that we all fund with the expectation of using"".

But I mean, it's a *World* Heritage site.  If you think that it should be protected -- and I'm not sold that everything on UNESCO's list should be, but assuming that it should -- and that not doing so is insulting in the sense of not preserving mankind's history, why is it something specific to the EU?  UNESCO is a UN agency, not an EU one.

&gt;Then you buddy up with authoritarian Hungary and threaten to protect each other from the consequences of violating EU law.

I also disagree on this one.  That is, if Article 7 is something that can be defeated, I see this as a consequence and limitation of decisions made in the EU's design.  The EU uses a veto-based system for many things (which I do not like, and think that the EU would be better off with all majority or supermajority votes but I realize that it's more-acceptable to members who might be dubious about joining the EU).  Because of that, if one is to ""override"" a ""rogue"" member, one has to totally strip the ability to vote from them as a fix for abuse of the veto.  (Note that I don't think that a permanent override is a good idea either -- I think that it should happen on a per-issue basis, but...)  So then you not surprisingly have two-or-more country blocs set up to protect each other.

Sure, it could theoretically work if everyone simply agreed to just work together, but, then, so could communism.

Honestly, I think that it's myopic to go after Poland and/or Hungary for this when the real flaw seems to be a design issue in the EU.  I would expect other EU members to ultimately do the same thing down the road.  That is, the fix for this is to eliminate the veto, not to whack Poland and Hungary for using the system in its present form.",europe

10258,"This is a fairly new thing in the last 5 years or so.  Basically, ""most PIN pads are for tippable service, so all PIN pads will just be this one type.""  US is very consumer driven, so I'm sure we have impacted Canada's systems now that we actually support chip transactions.

Tipping is weird here, a hold-over from the Great Depression.  Basically, I'm paying for the service.  If an employee makes less in tips than minimum wage, the restaurant will have to pay them the difference, and then they'll get fired.

We have a few places that say tipping is not expected, and they pay a low but fair wage to their workers.  Those places, the workers never hang around, asking for tips either.  (Sonic - drive-up hamburgers;  Starbucks - premium coffee).  To tip at those places, you have to have cash, and have to have it readily accessible.  Card/electronic payments give no option to tip.

Some places expect a tip.  20% is the standard.  If service was exceptional, then more than 20% might be warranted.  10% is ""you were horrible, and your manager should know it, but I don't want to make a fuss, and don't want you to spit in my food when I come back next month.""  0% is ""I'm never coming back, and if I do, I fully expect poop in my food.""  

This varies for low-priced and high-priced restaurants too.  If I pay $25 for a burger and fries, and my drink runs dry, then they have not earned 20%.  But if I pay $10 for a meal, and my drink is refilled three times, and I sit at the table for two hours talking to friends, then I might tip $10 or $12.

Also, I have a personal tip-o-meter.  Every trip to the table to do something I need is worth a dollar.  Every item delivered correctly is worth a dollar.  Mistakes don't count.  Delivery to my house is worth at least $5.  Whichever is greater, the tipometer, or 20%, is used to do tipping.  Uncorrected mistakes are a serious issue, and switch into subtracting from the base 20%.

Also, I have a favorite Chinese restaurant.  I order, and she'll drop the food at my table.  She cleans up when we leave.  I get my own drink, etc.  I spend $5 to $10, and I always tip $2 to $5.  It's the best Chinese food within 20 minutes of my house, and while I don't know her well, I feel she's undervalued and worth the extra.

On the other hand, some restaurants automatically add 18%.  See, 18% is less than 20%, so it doesn't seem like it's too much.  Except, if you received poor service, you have to talk to the manager to get the tip removed.  We have guilt, and confrontation issues, so we just let it slide.

On the other hand, I have friends who tip based on being a TIP at places which use tipping to cover the service charge.  This is offensive to workers, who may be working hard, serving lunch food at a discount, and getting very little pay for the extra hard work.

I really do think we're long overdue for removing the option to pay less than minimum wage in the US.  (We also have unpaid internships that also do not offer housing/food.  Lots of things designed to funnel money upwards.)",europe

10271,"You're purposely misconstruing the take-away of his point. In the context ""Jensen is Westbrook to Bjerg's LBJ"", it's not about who's deserving of winning the MVP trophy this year (yes, I do understand the poster above then had a paragraph talking specifically about how he thought Westbrook was ""underserving"" of MVP,  I'm in your camp -- Westbrook was MVP). 

However, this was not the original point to the analogy/comparison of Jensen/Westbrook to Bjerg/LeBron. LeBron is one of the best players of all time; who statistically improves during playoff games (I don't want to get into regular season coasting arguments or LBJ clutch arguments -- something that is undeniable is his PER and counting stats go up in the playoffs) and cares more about team accolades/championships over personal accolades/MVP, DPY, point leader etc. Bjergsen is at the same stage -- he's earned the individual accolades, so he's realized teams accolades are the next level. It's why TSM fans complain when he picks Galio or Karma over Syndra.

Westbrook and Jensen arent undisputed the best, and so personal accolades mean more. It doesn't mean they don't deserve them -- it just means they care and try harder than the people were comparing them to. Why do they try harder? Because people still doubt them as individuals, and it's very hard to perform as a team when you're always looking over your shoulder and under critique for your individual plays. 

Yet they are considered MVPs. It's just that you're comparing them to arguably the best player of their generation, and players who are at a different part of their career path. You can be the most valuable player, in the sense that you bring the most value to your team, but not win the team goals. Some people weight these accolades differently.",leagueoflegends

- Links to written articles (self or non-self involving)

- Links to artwork (I think you get the point by now)

- Feedback on content (and comments contain in such threads)

- Links to your own websites/emails/contact addresses

Ok. What about suicide rates in other demos:

1. Income - People who earned less than $34,000 were 50 percent more likely to commit suicide, researchers found. People who earned between $34,000 and $102,000 increased their risk for suicide by only 10 percent. http://www.businessinsider.com/link-between-wealth-and-suicide-rates-san-francisco-federal-reserve-2012-11

Let's not even get into PTSD which is probably a bigger compromise in the field than someone who is suicidal. PTSD is likely to remain under the surface until a year after a traumatic trigger. Imagine... out in the field and all of a sudden it strikes.

On to your actual point, Osama killed Americans in what could be argued as one of the worst attacks on American soil (yes, pearl harbor would be on that list too). He admitted to doing it, so the negative media focus on him is completely justified. Trump, on the other hand, has done no such thing. It may be your opinion that he is bad, but there is no evidence to support he is bad for the country or as a president at this time. Actually, the evidence is contrary to your opinion.

To take a person like that and expose them to widespread and anonymous degradation makes you no better than a schoolyard bully.  It may seem innocent and ok because everyone else is doing it but it isn't.  Plus people now use it off of the internet as well and in a non joking manner.  The next step will be for younger kids to see the older kids they look up to calling people autistic and start doing it themselves, and everyone knows little kids always take it too far.  After that, eventually calling someone autistic will be socially taboo and some new word will come along.  Just like when ""retard"" was the word.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b6cd882a7b3d450da87f34676143b8eb.png)  

&gt; William Elliott Whitmore (born May 11, 1978, Iowa, United States) is an American blues singer and musician from Lee County, Iowa. He has recorded a number of albums released on Southern Records, and now is a member of the Anti Records family. His act consists mostly of playing the banjo or guitar while singing, though on occasion he performs a cappella. While he has earned much acclaim from the folk, blues and alt-country communities, he is also rooted in the hardcore punk community, by paying, for example, a homage for the worldwide spread icon of Bad Religion.

&gt; Hailing from a horse farm along the banks of the mighty Mississippi River, Whitmore has developed an intense love and spiritual understanding of the land, which he flawlessly conveys through his second Southern Records release, Ashes To Dust.

&gt; With a voice that sounds decades older than he is and full of emotional depth, William again delivers his unique signature style. While comparisons to the gravely voice of Tom Waits and the lyrical story telling of Johnny Cash fly throughout reviews of William's music, all agree that this Iowan is onto something more than just regenerating the music of the past.

&gt; Perhaps one of the reasons can be found in the instrumentation William uses in recording his songs, relying mostly on the basics while allowing his vocal delivery to provide a true sense of rural being. But clearly, it is heard in his stories: personal stories of death, love found and then lost, to never be found again. ""Midnight"", the opening track for instance, was born out of the feeling of displacement. ""Diggin My Grave"" which originally appeared on a limited edition self-titled cd, speaks of the need, for some reason or another, to kill yourself slowly. ""Lift My Jug"" (songs for Hub Cale) is a song of the first, honest to god hobo he ever knew and how meeting him at the young impressionable age of six, greatly influenced his life. The closing track, ""Porchlight"", is the story of William's father, one of a dying farmer's last request.

&gt; With live performances of a caliber to leave one completely stunned in silence, and an album full of songs not only from the heart but also from the heartland, William Elliott Whitmore's Ashes to Dust is one of the most interesting contributions to today's diverse collection of musical ingenuity.

&gt; Whitmore has toured with Chris Cornell, City and Colour, The Pogues, Murder By Death, Clutch, Lucero, Converge, Red Sparowes, Modern Life is War, Frontier Ruckus, Frank Turner and The Low Anthem.

&gt; Whitmore's 2009 release, Animals in the Dark, reached #50 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Read more on Last.fm.

10450,"This is actually a very bad comparison. 

Ariane 5 ES have a significantly better insertion precision compared to Falcon 9, due to far more advanced upper stage with storable propellants. It can coast for a long time and perform multiple high precision burns. Just comparing the payload mass to orbit is a very poor metric here.

Same goes for Ariane 5 ECA, which not only has a better GTO payload mass (keep in mind that Ariane 5 lifts less to LEO and still much more to GTO) but also the actual target orbit is better, because it's GTO-1500 compared to GTO-1800 for Falcon 9.

On top of that Ariane 5 can lift 2 (or in some cases 3) satellites to orbit, while Falcon 9 often flies half empty, which makes the cost comparison even more complex, because Ariane customer pays for 1/2 (or 1/3) of the rocket, while SpaceX customer pays for the whole thing! If you check payload to orbit mass for Falcon 9 flights you will see that hardly any of them gets anywhere near the theoretical capacity, whereas for Ariane 5 it's usually very close.

&gt; - At lunchtime yesterday, Real Madrid made its first offer to buy David. A deal was agreed between the clubs, which included Navas being transferred to Old Trafford. The deals were dependent on each other.

&gt; - In the last several hours of the process, with Navas at the Real Madrid training ground, Real Madrid were controlling the documentation processes of David, Navas and Real Madrid. Manchester United was in control only of the documentation of Manchester United.

&gt; - Manchester United sent transfer documents for both players to Real Madrid at 20:42 BST. David’s documentation was returned by Real Madrid to Manchester United without the signatory page at 22:32 BST.

&gt; - At 22:40 BST, minutes before the deadline, major changes to the documentation came through to Manchester United which immediately put the deals at risk. 

&gt; - Only at 22:55 BST were the documents that are needed to cancel David’s contract received by Manchester United from Real Madrid.

&gt; - At this point Navas’ documentation was still not returned by Real Madrid.

&gt; - At 22:58 BST, the transfer agreement was sent back by Manchester United, uploaded onto TMS and accepted – all before the deadline.

&gt; - It is our understanding that the deals couldn’t happen because:

&gt; Real Madrid didn’t upload David’s documents onto TMS in time (Manchester United did)

&gt; Real Madrid didn’t upload David’s documents to the Spanish league in time, per reports it seems some 28 minutes after the deadline

&gt; - The fact that Manchester United filed the papers on time was acknowledged by the Football Association, who offered to support that claim in any discussions with FIFA. The club offered this assistance, as well as its own timestamped documents to Real Madrid but they have chosen not to go down this route.

&gt; Manchester United acts appropriately and efficiently in its transfer dealings. The club is delighted that its fan-favourite double Player of the Year, David de Gea, remains a Manchester United player.",soccer

10579,"I'll go against the grain and disagree with the article when it comes to me personally, I dislike Russians way more than I dislike their government (I think I am allowed to say this in this thread as it is directly on topic).

It has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine etc but more with the attitude of the people towards politics and their own country. In my country, it is basically the national sport to shit on our government and be against it. The biggest print newspaper is mostly anti-government. The biggest online news portal is radically anti-government. Even our subreddit is constant shitting on our government. Ministers and even governments are brought down by media discovering them doing shady things and publishing it everywhere. And that's how it should be, skepticism of those who rule you is healthy, they should be under heavy scrutiny. And I'm pretty sure my country is not the exception, this is widespread in Europe.

At the same time, most Russians will rabidly defend Russia and Putin and just make them look worse through obviously brainwashed behavior, ""everyone HATES Russia"", complaining about ""western propaganda"" while being willing to accept media that is literally state-controlled... Also they seem to have very little interest in purely internal issues and mostly care about geopolitics which is pathetic - the more advanced a society is, the more it becomes concerned with ""polishing"" its internal problems (corruption, liberty, political process, fairness, taxes, equality, justice system, prisons, sustainability, environmentalism...) and less with stuff like expanding territory.

Why I dislike their government less? Listen to Putin discussing some issues some time, he usually makes a lot of sense, and when he criticizes some western country, he will never make a fool of himself. And he is head of government, it is after all his job to be an apologist. I disagree with a lot of things he does, but Putin is way more reasonable personally than his supporters (or even than most people who claim they are not supporters, but still defend the government).",europe

In the study, older mice who were transfused with the blood from young and healthy mice showed signs of restored brain activity and muscle growth""

""A start-up is offering people over 35 the chance to get teenage blood for $8,000 to fight aging

It might sound like science fiction, or a recent episode of ""Silicon Valley,"" but a start-up called Ambrosia is charging $8,000 for blood transfusions from young people.

About 100 people have signed up to receive an infusion, founder Dr. Jesse Karmazin said Wednesday at the Code Conference.

Anyone over age 35 can become an Ambrosia customer, said Karmazin, but most of the early adopters tend to be of retirement age. He also stressed that it's a range of people, and not just Bay Area technologists, who have signed up.

The donated blood typically comes from teenagers, although anyone under age 25 is eligible. The company buys its supply from blood banks, which also sell blood to pharmaceutical companies. So high-schoolers donating their blood are not aware that it might be used on healthy adults.

Speaking to a roomful of technologists, Karmazin explained that the company does not claim that it can cure aging. Instead, he's hoping to recruit hundreds more people to research whether the transfusions can help fight particular symptoms associated with aging. Traditionally, biological aging hasn't been treated as a disease, which makes it challenging to study.

Karmazin said those who have signed up have seen some positive benefits and haven't reported any negative ones. Blood transfusions come with a variety of risks, including allergic reactions.""

10683,"First of all, I am a firm believer that elo hell **does** exist. That doesn't mean that I blame my teammates for everything they do and never look at myself. Both sides of this huge discussion / argument are completely wrong and I'm here to chime in with some references from actual sports that do have a sense of elo hell in them. In fact, anything competitive, whenever it be a game or a sport, is going to be the same in a ranking system such as this.

---

First off, some facts.

1: Elo Hell exists, but it is different for every one.
---

The reason that elo hell exists is separate from everyone because of every single factor of said human being participating in the competition. From their skill level, to how healthy they keep themselves, **everything** affects their game, and in turn, if they are stuck in a certain bracket. Personally, I've been living with depression my entire life. I've had certain circumstances that has shut me down from any competition in video games because I was unable to improve at them. **Until OW made me realize otherwise.** OW made me realize how **wrong** people were. How much of what was wrong with me was put in my face. Then, I simply turned to **fix what was wrong.**

2: Stylosa was right when he said ""Rank doesn't Matter."" It is not a meme.
---

SR, is... for all purposes, just a number blizzard assigned your account to match you properly and rank you, approximating your skill level. Sure, you can use this as a baseline for your skill, but skill isn't even a factor in which most athletes even worry about. Most athletes don't tell themselves how they need to be *x* good to do *y*, they tell themselves: ""I need to improve *x* amount so I can be sure I can do my best at *y*."" However, for some reason Stylosa's statement is treated as a meme, and it disgusts me.

3: The gaming competitive community is not as encouraging as the sports community.
---

In Sports, almost everyone is encouraging to push you to your limits. To make you do this and to motivate you to never give up. As a low-silver however, I've had several people, from top 500s to professionals in an actual OW professional team, be extremely elitist to me and tell me that my opinion does not matter, and that I need to be *this* rank to have any worth in this community. I'm sure someone out there will completely tell me off for this post because of my rank. This is also the reason I left /r/Overwatch official discord, aside from other personal reasons. Pros and even coaches do not 100% care for the people below them. Remember Seagull telling a donator: ""Get Gud."" at someone needing help that was in Elo Hell? It isn't elitist since he was in the middle of a comp match, but I would have said: ""It's complicated. Not now."" Sure, you see some of these pros actually post videos of how to improve mechanical gameplay and other things, but they never tell you how to **really** improve. How to actually improve as a human being, both mind and body, to **truly** *rank up*, not just in SR, but in yourself. *Put that on a card, hallmark.*

4: Improving is not about increasing your skill level.
---
Sounds really damn odd. I mean, skill does correlate to your rank, standing, and everything else, right? Look at sports. There are a lot of instances where small-time players who really want to get into this team as a **goal**, similar to reaching a certain SR number **goal**, don't make it at all. They say that they work 200%, get up early and shoot hoops before going to school, do everything in their power, blood, focus, and tears, to reach their goal, only to *fail*. But that's the point. **Failure is exactly what you want.** Of course, purposely failing won't teach you anything or make you improve, but if you play your best in an overwatch comp game, and lose. That doesn't mean you've gone farther from your *goal*. It just means you found a way that wouldn't get you to it. Or in the case of OW competitive, you found your mistakes that you need to fix to better yourself.

There's a lot more factoids, but I can't think of anymore.

---

The second part is this post I made in a DM with someone.


    A lot of people see Competitive as just... the end goal.
    To get top 500
    To get whatever number.
    I believed that too.
    Then I looked back at actual competitive sports and realized it's really not about that.
    It's about the journey.
    Edison once said that those who never failed, have never tried.
    Rocky Balboa himself quoted that it aint how hard you hit.
    It's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
    Same with overwatch. It's not about how good or skilled you are.
    It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge.
    As well as learn from it.
    And recently from being motivated from Elliot's speech of how ""You're supposed to fail.""
    The SR system being completely rigged to make you have a higher chance of losing as you climb.
    Is exactly what it's supposed to do.
    When people just see it as a grind. As a number. As a goal. People tilt when they see it go farther from said goal.
    If I had to apply these quotes to overwatch, it would be this personal quote.
    ""It's not about how good or skilled you are. It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge, as well as learn from it.""

*“I have not failed, not once.  I’ve discovered ten thousand ways that don’t work.”* ―Thomas Edison

*“Life's not about how hard of a hit you can give... it's about how many you can take, and still keep moving forward.”* ―Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa

**""It's not about how good or skilled you are. It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge, as well as learn from it.""** ―TheGandalf's Shameless Rocky Balboa OW Adaptation

I made a quote. Eat my shorts.

---

My personal addendum is this. I've been dealing with low silver for weeks now. I personally feel I'm slightly above that level, but I'm not aiming to prove I'm at that level. I'm aiming to improve. My **actual** SR will be above what the **SR System is actually telling me.** because I'm not aiming to bring it up. I'm aiming to improve my personal skill. SR will slowly go up naturally, and despite throwers, griefers, toxicity, or whatever. This SR system only looks at **you,** not your team. Only you can bring you down, theoretically. Not your team.

My best advice? **Mindset.** Acknowledge that the road ahead of you **will be a hard one.** Acknowledge that all the shit that comes with OW Competitive will hit you hard. If it doesn't, enjoy your easy top 500. Nobody will care but your loyal fans that kiss your boots. But me? And everyone else that's stuck down here? Everyone else that is being beaten and smacked around by this so called SR system and Elo Hell that you implore doesn't exist? We'll work our personal ass off and make your 500 a crowning fucking achievement. Everyone is different. You might have it easy, but **some of us have to go through literal hell just to reach SR 2000.**

Either way, once I become better then **you.** Better then **Stylosa.** Better then **Seagull.** All the way from the bottom with only the blood, sweat, and tears fueling me. The vengeance from your insults, your elitism, your will of keeping my mind chained to the bottom of this ladder empowering me to go further. The dedication that will never falter until my last dying breath. Then I'll be able to finally be the one to prove you wrong. And to prove to the people with the same situation as mine, that it's not only a hard road, but a possible one.

So open up the Device Manager program on windows and go to Mice and other pointing devices and disable any that arent your actual mouse. Also do the same under the keyboards section.

This fixed it for me.

If this doesnt work, the best thing i can suggest (which i did on my old pc) is to download a mouse control setup program (google) and bind your mouse button 4/5 to a key you dont use in lol, like brackets or something. Then in game instead of selecting mouse button 4/5 you select brackets and lol thinks you are pressing bracket, but you are pressing mouse button 4 and the program is converting that to brackets.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c6606ae5fd6b40098a2b3163fc2867cc.png)  

&gt; Francis Albert Sinatra (born December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey; died May 14, 1998 in Los Angeles, California) was an Italian American Grammy Award winning jazz singer, Academy Award winning actor, founder of Reprise Records and member of The Rat Pack. Beginning his musical career in the Swing Era along with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a highly successful solo artist, releasing 59 studio albums and becoming the idol of the 'bobby soxers'.

&gt; His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned fifty in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, and scored hits with ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""My Way"". Sinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with ""(Theme From) New York, New York"", and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998.

&gt; Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and had three children; Nancy, Frank Jr. and Tina by his first wife Nancy Barbato. He was married three more times, to the actresses Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and finally to Barbara Marx, to whom he was married at his death.

&gt; Sinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century"".

10771,"The issue isn't with ""distraction"", it's with immersion. It's not the viewer's fault that the scene pulled them out of the show, it's the show's. Just because it didn't happen to you doesn't mean that the people who it happened to are wrong, it just means you have different thresholds for suspension of disbelief. If Ed Sheeran also had a giant green mohawk, as a silly example, then maybe you might be able to see yourself losing immersion.

The biggest issue with Ed himself was that he didn't have a character. If Ed was the dude who talked about his wife and kid or the dude who made the wine, I'd be much less pulled out of the world than I was. The other (bigger) issue was that along with Ed pulling me out of the world, the scene itself did too. 

Throughout the *entire goddamn series* we've been shown that the world is fucking *merciless*. It's a horrible place to live, and even in the same episode we see the peasants who Sandor stole from have perished. Hell, we've seen multiple scenes where soldiers just straight up raped and killed girls because they could.

And yet here we have a band of happy-go-lucky young men who drink wine and hunt and eat their catches, sing their merry songs, greet and host travellers, have children, love life, far removed from the people they're fighting for. 

I get it, it was trying to remind us that ""soldiers are people too"", but it was so ham-fisted that compounded with Ed Sheeran it shattered my suspension of disbelief. There were so many other ways to show a lighter side to the world, but they just shoved it in with a shoved in cameo. I mean ""Are you old enough to drink""!? Like come on, this shit is not good writing.

I want to clarify: Ed Sheeran did *nothing* wrong and anyone who says anything bad about him are fucking idiots. I actually thought his song was really well done, and I would've loved if he was actually a bloody character. My issue is with the creators of the show making the scene immersion-breaking by making some shoddy mistakes.

It's the same reasons people are frustrated at the weirdness surrounding Dany's army and Euron's army. It doesn't make sense with respect to the world we've been shown (although some of the explanations are quite good).

As a side: Compare the scene to Jim Broadbent's scene. Jim took me out for a second (as all new, famous actors in the show do) but he developed his character within a few lines. Mentor to Sam, likes him somewhat, dedicated to his job, etc... What about Ed's character? He's a Lannister soldier. That's it. 

TL;DR: Ed did nothing wrong, the writers screwed him over imo.",gameofthrones

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*!

Anyways, like the music of what your generation is, it spoke to you. As much as the animation was cool, the dystopian world that Akira was created, you were expecting it. Cool brash kid, sweet wheels, chicks that rocked, that was every kid at the time. It survives well, but since I am older now, it does not speak to me any more than Code Geass, or fullmetal alchemy.

No, it's actually a prime example: Billions were sunk into Fukushima and even more was about to be sunk into it. They were building two new reactors (#5 and #6) on the same site.

That's the problem with nuclear. Once you have committed so much money you won't just give up that investment, even if it is a stupid idea to keep running it.

&gt; As to the rest of your arguments against nuclear, you make some really good points!

Thank you.

&gt; I know how they work, the problem is the efficiency and scale to use heated salt to replace fossil fuels is a lot more impractical than I've heard anyone supporting that technology admit. You lose a lot of energy in trying to store the heat and it has limited life (I've read 5-6 hours of decent energy output). Add in to that the cost to run infrastructure to these plants which are quite remote, and factor in loss, and its practical, but barely so for the cost.

If you can support nuclear then supporting this should be a no brainer ;)

Even if you only get 5 - 6 hours out of it after sunset that still gives you ample time to make use of the electricity. You could for example keep the output running at full tilt, then use the electricity to generate hydrogen. When the morning rush starts you could burn the hydrogen in a standard (natural gas) power plant and keep your base load.

There are ways around all these limitations if there is a will. The problem simply is that the amount invested in these technologies is remarkably small compared to what nuclear for example has received and is receiving with very little to show for really.

&gt; I'll have to do some more research. I think the Chinese have successfully built or tested a thorium reactor based on the CANPAR reactor design which has been shown to be incredibly safe, so i'm not 100% convinced yet that Nuclear isn't a possibly bridge solution. However the red tape and lack of construction expertise does limit the timeframe, which could negate the usefulness of it vs alternative energies IF the developments needed can happen in the next decade or two.

Both the Japanese and the Chinese are giving Thorium a whirl. The Chinese are also building a few CANDU reactors. All of them are supposed to be ""safe"".

Here's the problem though: The way safety is determined is by calculating the odds of something specific happening. The ""calculation"" is really not much more than wetting the finger, sticking it in the air to determine where the wind blows from and then attaching a number to it. So risk assessments are pretty useless (What was the calculation? There should only be one serious incident with nuclear reactors every million years or so? Fukushima alone had three reactors go critical within free days, that tells you how much these calculations are worth).

Furthermore, operating manuals etc. Are all based on the assumption of what is / can / should happen. If you step outside the operating manual (it has essentially a decision tree the operators are supposed to follow) all it tells you is: Kiss your ass good bye.

Many nuclear apologists, for example, when it comes to Fukushima retain that it wasn't the failure didn't lie with the nuclear reactor, but rather that the tsunami is to blame for it. This is a very dishonest statement because it is **our** technology that failed. It does not matter what caused the failure it only matters that we did have one. This is the big problem with any of these ""risk assessments"", they operate on the ""it can't be what isn't supposed to be"" and if what isn't supposed to be happens we're fucked.

&gt; Ric Ocasek (born Richard Otcasek on March 23, 1949) is the vocalist and frontman for The Cars and a producer for several other groups, including Bad Brains, Suicide and Weezer.

&gt; Ocasek released his first solo album in 1982. Beatitude is a somewhat more experimental variation of The Cars' New Wave rock sound. A more synthesizer-heavy follow up, This Side Of Paradise, was released in 1986. A minor hit, ""Emotion In Motion"" accompanied the album.

&gt; The Cars split in 1987, and Ocasek disappeared from the public eye for several years, resurfacing in 1990 with Fireball Zone. One track, ""Rockaway"", enjoyed a brief stay on the charts, but his solo albums have seen disappointing sales, especially compared to his success with the Cars. He subsequently released other solo works throughout the decade, including 1993's Quick Change World, 1996's Getchertikitz (a collaboration with Suicide's Alan Vega), and 1997's Billy Corgan-produced Troublizing (which Ocasek supported with a very brief tour, his first since leaving the Cars). In 2005, Ocasek released another album, Nexterday, to little fanfare but positive reviews.

&gt; In 2010, Ocasek reunited with the surviving original members of The Cars to record their first album in 24 years, titled Move Like This, which came out on May 10, 2011. Read more on Last.fm.

10910,"What the techniques behind RAPM/RPM would help you understand is a player's net impact on his team's AST% differential, because that's exactly what they currently do for a player's net impact on his team's point differential.

You actually likely would want to adjust the technique to no longer consider the opposing team (making it simpler) in this case now that I think of it, because certainly the AST% of the opposing team is irrelevant to your team.

You're gonna just need to read up on how RAPM is calculated if you want more answers because I truly don't feel like explaining it in depth, and there are probably pages out there that would do a better job than me anyhow. What I have tried to explain to you very clearly is what it does, if not necessarily all of the details on how.

&gt;You haven't given me shred of evidence that ""off"" assist percentages can be found using RPM... 

That's because strictly speaking they're NOT. That's kind of the whole point, right? I'm saying raw off assist percentages are highly flawed and that the techniques behind RPM/RAPM offer a better way to solve the same fundamental question. But the entire point is that they aren't the same. They just address the same question.

&gt;We are looking for how a team moves the ball without their star player, RPM and RAPM nor their methods would help us in that regard. 

They certainly would, by telling us how star players impact AST% in general.

&gt;So why should we suddenly use RPM? (Which is impossible to do) 

It's not impossible to use the techniques of RAPM. I do believe RPM is proprietary so yes, that would be impossible. We should use it because it's better and on/off is deeply flawed. I'm blue in the face with explaining that by now.",nba

&gt; Agalloch was an American metal band formed in Portland, Oregon, United States in 1995. On May 13th, 2016, Agalloch announced their disbandment. John Haughm released the following statement regarding the status of Agalloch:

&gt; ""After being inundated by a barrage of responses, I feel that I should clarify some things. I take full responsibility for the decision to part ways with the other guys. It was difficult, well thought-out, and something that had been culminating over the past couple of years. I simply could not continue any further with the band as it was. I had to make a change as my motivation and inspiration had started to completely deteriorate. Whether this is the permanent end of Agalloch altogether or a possible fresh start, I don't know. I probably won't know for awhile. The band has simply been reduced back to its founding, visionary member for the first time in 20 years. Beyond that, the future is unknown.""

&gt; For twenty years the Pacific Northwest group defined what it means to combine influences from a variety of musical genres into one brooding, colossal, and cinematic sound that provides the soundtrack to existential themes concerning man, nature, loss, and death.

&gt; After two demo releases in the late 90s the band released three full-length albums: Pale Folklore (1999), The Mantle (2002), and Ashes Against the Grain (2006). “The Mantle” has since been heralded as a classic for having been one of the first albums to combine elements from black metal, neo-folk, progressive rock, post-rock, and ambient music. The influence of this record can be heard in many so-called “post-black metal” bands today.

&gt; In 2008 Agalloch began re-releasing their demos, B-sides, and EPs under their own Dammerung Arthouse label. In 2010 their fourth album Marrow of the Spirit made number one on numerous critic’s top ten lists. In between each of these full-lengths the band pushed on the flexible boundaries they had developed around themselves through a series of EPs that found the band experimenting with post-rock/instrumental rock (The Grey, 2004), neo-folk/psychedelic folk (“The White EP, 2008) and a mammoth twenty-minute epic work entitled Faustian Echoes (2012) released through Dammerung Arts. Their fifth and last full-length album The Serpent &amp; the Sphere (2014) has continued to earn praise for solidifying the now identifiable sound of the band.

&gt; Agalloch earned a reputation for explosive and emotional live performances. They sold out tours across Europe and the US and played a variety of major international festivals including: Roadburn, Inferno, Ragnarok, Tomahawk, Noctis, Asymmetry Fest, Maryland Deathfest, Scion Fest and others. The band took special care constructing the environment of each and every show with wood, incense, and imagery taken directly from their home in the Northwest. Such care made an Agalloch show more than just a typical heavy metal concert.

10982,"This thing was ugly all-around. I lost a lot of respect for the Manning family. 

If you remember, Archie Manning was campaigning against the Chargers quite openly. And distastefully. Then Peyton joined in. And Eli sort of sheepishly went along with it.

The problem for San Diego isn't that the Manning family argued against San Diego, the problem is that they *told the truth about the organisation*, which is that it's not a very good one. The Mannings extracted a pound of flesh from AJ Smith and the Spanos family. If they were going to have their prodigal son drafted, the Mannings were going to air all of the Chargers dirty laundry.

Do the Chargers fans care? No. Because they don't believe there's anything wrong. But you know who does care? Other players and their agents. Other teams and their GMs. You don't talk about the problems of other teams openly when you're a Manning. But they did. And they didn't damage the reputation of the Chargers - they did it on their own; they confirmed to other people in the NFL that it's not a team worth doing business with.

The fans think whatever they think of the Chargers. Good payroll, seem to be there, blah blah. But the people in the league were empowered to stand up to the Chargers. You saw Vincent Jackson do it. Marcus McNeill did it. Acrimony. It's not a nice destination for free agents if there's a reputation of having to deal with bullshit. The team has been forcing the city to give it handouts for decades now and threatening to move. The team, under the past 3 GMs, the latter two who are totally different than Bobby Beathard have had problems attracting free agents and retaining players.

The Mannings said what everyone whispered in private. San Diego is a bad place to play. But AJ Smith confirmed it. Now you see acrimony. The Chargers may be messed up, but you don't do that to them when you're the Mannings. You just don't.",nfl

11025,"Rant incoming:


The characters are pretty much all ripped off from other popular LNs. It's kind of hard to describe them, though. Everyone is cliched to the point where it hurts to watch, including the MC and, unlike 8man (whose character archetype and even he himself ironically become cliches), he doesn't notice those cliches.

I'll never understand that type of character in anime. How can one not have any hobbies or interests whatsoever? Unless it's in a damn Kafka novel, that type of character just doesn't work. Especially in this type of medium, where one's living conditions and surroundings and, probably most important of all, history and past experiences, are barely explained and everything is focused on relationships between a small cast of characters.

If you want that kind of character in your story, you have to make like classic Russian novelists and describe how a wheat field looks, who maintains it, how it came to be and how it fares in bad weather across 250 pages in a 1500 page book. Only if you put extraordinary detail in the setting can you make a character like that work. Those writers even upped the ante by describing their characters in even more detail. I understand it's easier to start from a completely blank slate character who only has a name and then add cheap character development later on, but that never turns out well. A character like that simply isn't a well written character. A certain character can be flawed but still well written. This type of character cannot ever be considered ""well-written.""

The entire medium of light novels is so damn cheap it's infuriating. Do the writers of light novels not have a shred of dignity as artists whatsoever? How can they express themselves in such a boring, unsatisfying way in a setting that's been done a million times with a few small changes, and with characters that pander to the worst audience on this planet? Perhaps that is the reason why 95% of all LNs ever written, in my opinion, are garbage. Just a quick money grab with no substance or heart put into it whatsoever. A plagiat of a plagiat of a plagiat which plagiarized something that was inspired by a western plagiat. That's what light novels are.

11029,"And it would be the absolute same outpouring of response if a group of extremists started targeting doctors or teachers or humanitarian workers (and they do mind you!). The idea is that these people actively do and are, even more, defined by their role in the community makes them more ""prominent"" in the eyes of the people. 

Look, its not a matter of importance (as I've noted before). Its that these people (monks, doctors, teachers) are, in our minds eye, defined by their role as peacemakers and bringers of good. When you think about common folk like you and me, you're initial thought is not ""these are the portents of peace and goodness and models of society!"" Absolutely not. Our view of common people, like it or not, is often turned towards the ideas of a bunch of glutton, self centered, physically defined people. 

People can value others in different ways but that doesn't simply mean we discount their importance. We value a monk in a way that is different from the way we value a doctor or even a trash collector. We value a monk for his/her teachings of philosophy and religion while we value a teacher for his/her teachings of practical knowledge, a doctor for their ability to cure, even a newspaper man's ability to bring the news on time. A community will rally when those values are infringed upon. What you see here is an example of that. 

Don't limit yourself to what you just see here in the news. As I said, look at it in the grander scheme and you'll come to better understanding of why people do things like this, extremists or otherwise. Attacking a physical manifestation of an idea (i.e. the monk) is enough to get anyone riled up. ",worldnews

Turkish teams haven't even made it far in Europa League recently and you're telling me you're up there with the other giants ffs


If Real, Barca, Bayern are world class then  teams like Liverpool, Napoli, Arsenal, Sevilla are CL quality teams(leaving MU out due to clear bias). Tottenham who finished 2nd in the PL didn't even make it out of the group stage. And you know as well as I do that Besiktas making it to the knockout stages would be a major accomplishment even if you won the league. 

Pretty sure Galatasaray's ridiculous run to the quarter finals almost a decade ago was the furthest a Turkish team has ever made it in the CL.

I'm saying this as a Turkish person who has been watching multiple leagues for years now, the TFF quality is around the Dutch league at this point. 

To say a team like Ajax wouldn't use Joe Allen, Berahino, or Arnautovic in their first team is ridiculous . Stoke are also known for beating the bigger teams in PL hence the ""cold, wet Tuesday evening in stoke"" memes.

Are Stoke a mid-table team? Absolutely. However, Stoke are also in one of the elite leagues.

Chicago actually was pretty successful against gangs in the 90s, and locked up many gang leaders. While that tactic pretty much eroded the gang structures in Chicago, they never followed it up with getting rid of or barely reducing drug trafficking. So, instead of a handful of large, organized gangs fighting over drug trade, you now have many more smaller gangs of mostly teenagers, who fight over individual blocks. 

This isnt to suggest that Gang leaders and dictators like Saddam Hussein should remain in power, but this country really needs to start figuring out how to handle the after effects and power vacuums when they get rid of such people/groups, since their current strategies only seem to make it worse in the end.

I used to think this, but I doubt it now. These play directly into Trump's agenda. 

A few years ago the US announced you wanted to sell natural gas to us. [Trump openly announced that this is his goal](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/339712-natural-gas-exports-centerpiece-of-trumps-energy-plan_). And the profits from that will go right to large Trump donors and states that voted for him. Congress didn't pass this to ""defy"" Trump but because it will [mean tens of billions of dollars to their donors](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30052) and 50% more expensive gas for German industry. 

[Trump already extended sanctions and prevented Exxon from doing business in Russia.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/21/trump-administration-says-it-wont-grant-any-exception-to-russia-sanctions-not-even-to-exxonmobil/?utm_term=.ada1377c2eac). If Trump was going to roll back sanctions or the like, he would have done it for Exxon - it would have been pretty defensible since that really just hurt Exxon and not Russia. Now our state oil company, [Statoil, is drilling where Exxon would have](https://www.rosneft.com/press/news/item/185549/).  

Trump being ""against"" greater sanctions is a great selling point but frankly no one cares here about that and few believe it. 

Germany, France, Italy and more are against them since they will hurt our economies. Its easy for the US to be for sanctions that will benefit them. ",europe

11120,"&gt; It is heading that way,not today,not tomorrow, not even in 10 or 50 years.

I think we're looking at star trek levels of futurism there. We'll continue to have deep inequalities for a long time. The human race continues to expand at a breathtaking pace, problematically so in those environments which do not sustain the local populations. Economic inequality across the world naturally triggers large scale migration in to more prosperous environments and economies. 

I think before we get anywhere near a truly globalised world, there's a few prerequisites :-


* Technological advancements allowing us to ascend beyond inherent limitations in various environments of the world, providing economic equality across the populations. 
* Religions which triggers strife (war) by seeking to limit people's rights and progress (and which attempts to spread itself aggressively) takes a back seat within our societies.
* We let go of nationalism and embrace the change (as you've pointed out).
* Government(s) act in the best interests of more than their term of service and work towards the best interests of all.

I suspect before we get anywhere near economic equality in globalism (the trick which would remove people's fear factor), we're going to have some horrible events within our populations as growth overwhelms our ability to sustain and service it (50-100 years is my guess). Instead we'll continue see globalisation across only rich nations, and all the politics and unfairness that goes with that. ",europe

&gt; Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American folk-rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel formed with fellow musician Art Garfunkel. When Simon &amp; Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, Paul Simon. This was followed by There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as Loves Me Like A Rock and Kodachrome. In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular Graceland, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the successor album The Rhythm of the Saints which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre.

&gt; He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical The Capeman with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997. 

&gt; Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to Edie Brickell. 

&gt; In 1994 Paul Simon held 14 sold out concerts in Nantes (France) with International professional fusion players: Nino Manore (Italy), Francis Mc Gowan (UK), Gissele Masarde (France), Nikša Sviličić (Croatia), and others. Read more on Last.fm.

This case could set a precedent for the other clubs and essentially make FFP useless (which is what I said it would be in the first case anyway).

If the sponsorship passes, you would expect that very quickly the other clubs will start announcing new sponsorship deals on everything - from training grounds, dressing rooms, neighbouring buildings, the carpark, etc. etc. Melwood may come to be called 'The Boston Red Sox Liverpool FC Standard Chartered Training Area' for another £10M a year.

The city of Cheb alone located about 50 kilometers north of Weiden (Upper Palatinate), have to remove about five tons of waste from illegal garbage dumps every year.

Because bundes in games, specifically League, have set a standard of always being sale priced skins in a big bunch. The only time a bundle wasn't anywhere from 10% to 75% off separate skins was last year's SKT bundle when the Ward was 1rp but otherwise everything cost the same. They have the price high because they know how monumental and impactful the skin set is. They know people would even pay more than usual for the bundle because team skin sets are like that and such a focus was put on this year's skins.

&gt; if anything they'd make MORE money total from it being on sale lmao

That's exactly what he's saying though. Are you stupid? Everybody is saying ""If the bundle was on sale we'd actually buy it but considering it's basically buying all 6 skins + the ward full price, we'll hold off"".

11574,"This article treats sony dropping vinyl as if it were a huge error in judgement. It wasn't.

Sony didn't adopt CDs. Sony and Philips *created* the CD. Sony pulled a marketing move to try and get everyone and everything to jump ship by declaring the vinyl format dead when it didn't matter if it was or not, getting their new guy in to replace vinyl was the move. For a long time CDs were practically the only way to go - and I'm sure sony made a mint off having their format in almost a full monopoly.

I'll start with the social aspect. You know how people complain about how ""empty"" the world feels. In part because group finder makes it so you don't have to build groups and go to the dungeon anymore. 

The Mythic system addresses this in the same way as the rated vs unrated system does. It forces you to socialize, interact, and strategize/experiment  which are opportunities to MAKE friends.

The other reason is for more specific to RBGs. Prebuilt teams with communication will generally stomp randomly made teams. If you want a YOLO team, it isn't that hard to find. However you want to generally encourage as many premade teams as possible, so they can queue against eachother. A system with ranked solo queing would make queue times for premade teams even longer(or lower the quality of games greatly for non premade teams).

A lot of the time, patients either beat the cancer or die within a few years. Sometimes it comes back, but not always.

Unfortunately, I'd have to disagree with you. Some of the most significant money in baseball is coming from the cable television contracts. While the population in Oregon is greatly surpassed by North Carolina, there is only one professional sports team in the state, and only two professional sports teams on the west coast outside of California. 

In terms of the value of a regional sports network cable TV contract, it's worth lot of money. The fan base in NC and VA would be regarded as torn between other baseball teams and other professional sports teams, while the team in Portland will have a lot of the fans from the west coast, stretching pretty far east into the midwest, and as far west as China/Japan/Korea.

[Oh wow, I see why people ship Oscar and Rosalie.](http://i.imgur.com/mbwScZV.png)  

A lot of stuff happened in this episode.  
We see that Rosalie is completely in love with Oscar. And more important than that, Rosalie knows that she's in love with Oscar. But she thinks that she cannot declare her love, which is understandable considering the time.  
Unfortunately, Polignac was sick and couldn't go to the ball. We instead met her daughter, Charlotte, who's also an unpleasant character. Like mother, like daughter, I guess.  

Jeanne is back, still doing what she does best: lying. At least in this episode she seems to feel a bit of sadness about her mother's death, even though she didn't show it. Or maybe it was just her surprise to see Rosalie here.  
I really liked [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/N8Myava.png) by the way. It really shows the two different personality of the sisters. One is cold, with a look a la du Barry, aiming for money and power. The other one is fragile and unsure, she's also lying but she only wants revenge.  

Nothing is more satisfying that Oscar being Oscar: she stood up against Polignac and even asked that Charlotte apologize!

11938,"&gt;It seems we have basically all the healers we might need.

I disagree, I think there's a lot of healer archetypes that could be added to OW.

So, what could be added? 



* A builder hero would be good for a start. Paladins has 2 of them. One (Grohk) deploys a healing field similar to S76's, so let's ignore that since that mechanic is already present in OW. The other one (Ying) deploys clones of herself that periodically heal the closest ally. The clones can also be detonated to damage enemies. Something something heal-bot summoning Omnic idea.

* Another one could be something like how Auriel works in HotS. For those that don't know, Auriel can burst heal an area every couple of seconds. The amount she heals for depends on a charge meter (think Zarya). So, Auriel chooses a champion (a teammate), all the damage that that ally does (as well as Auriel's own damage) charges her hope meter.

* Original idea! Put Ana's grenades in Junkrat's gun. Oh, and make them apply a heal over time (that doesn't stack) instead of burst healing. I'm taking about the healing part, not the anti-heal, of course.

* Then there's Paladins' Seris, who has very fun gameplay while having very simple healing mechanics. Her heal is pretty much Mercy's beam, channeled over 2-3 seconds, with a 5 second cooldown. Why would this be something you'd pick over Mercy if it was in Overwatch? Well, the heal could be stronger than Mercy's, if she was a main healer (so you get better value out of 1 heal, but have to pick your targets more carefully because of the CD).

I'm not speaking in totality - you are partially correct when you say religion can be authoritarian. I know how and why science is a great method to discerning a wide type of truth. Many do not however, and I believe such inability arises in a lack of religious understanding. Innate trust (faith) that scientists (priests/politicians) have gathered and interpreted the data (text/polls) correctly. ""Science"" as a label is all that's needed for truth, just as ""God"" was before.

12034,"Several glaring issues with the video.  
  
First of which, he invents an entirely new system which could (not really) work, but provides no supporting evidence as to why the current accepted theory is false.  
  
Second, his system has some pretty big issues, first of which is his magical extremely powerful magnetic field which would be required to curve that much gas. That would play hell with all navigational equipment, even the humble compass would be rendered useless.   
  
He also doesn't seem to understand atmospheric refraction, which has been well tested and well proven which is why the sun disappears rapidly and before the light goes away. That's explained much better with a round Earth than the single brightest light source magically becoming invisible because it moved too far away.  
  
Could a massively powerful magnet passing through the sky excite neon to create a color spectrum as seen at sunset? Maybe. Could it be done without wreaking havock on electrical and navigation systems? Absolutely not.  
  
Pilots have to reset their plane's gyroscopes every 100 miles or so to maintain an accurate reading. Why is this?  
  
A large pendulum in a vacuum can be used as a clock by placing 24 ticks in a circle around the point. Why?  
  
I have personally experienced the Coriolis effect, I missed every time I didn't account for it. Why?  
  
The planets we observe follow a gravitational model which has yet to be proven wrong and requires the sun be as massive as observed, not magically tiny and close. Why?  
  
We can observe moons moving around Jupiter as it is a spherical object. I can see the moon is spherical with a 30$ pair of binoculars. Why are they spherical but the Earth magically flat?  
  
And finally, my favorite point to bring up, are you able to provide a 2D map of the earth which accurately predicts the distance between any two points?  
  
A global model can do this. Therefore, you have 3 options.  
  
A) Disprove the mathematical proof Theorema Egregium which says there is no possible way to map a 3D object perfectly to a 2D plane of the object.  
  
B) Find an inconsistency in a distance provided by the global model  
  
C) Prove that the Earth is an infinite flat plane which would allow a 3D model to be perfectly mapped on a 2D plane.

I think he did a good job of describing what he characterized as 'gravy'. By tying it into councilor overspending he established his definition of 'gravy' as areas of obvious waste with absolutely no public benefit. The only other specific example of 'gravy' I can remember him giving during the campaign was when he spoke about contracts that didn't receive enough competitive bidding.

Essentially, he made the point that he would be able to bring the budget in without cutting any legitimate services and insinuated that there was so much waste (gravy) that its elimination would facilitate his budgetary goals. Anybody with sense, even talk radio guys like John Tory who largely supported Ford, admitted that his numbers didn't add up. They knew it was nonsense to suggest that there was so much waste present that it could offset the deficit. I'm sure Rob Ford also knew it was nonsense, but it would be a lot harder to attain victory of he ran on platforms like eliminating water fluoridation and letting all parks fall into disrepair and disuse after cutting their budget. 

That's the point they are trying to make. The 'gravy' was a fairy tale. There was never enough 'gravy' to effect the budget in any meaningful way. Actual cuts would be necessary (if raising taxes was off the table).

Most guys play to win games as well as for the salary they get paid to do so. They love football. Albert strikes me as the type who views it as a job, not a passion... A job where he already got paid huge portion of his pay in advance with no penalty for not working hard from here on out....

Meanwhile 3 at the back in the same situation we only need 1 winger, then someone to compete with an oft injured Ramsey (but that isn't necessarily needed, we have wilshere, cazorla, elneny, coquelin, chambo). Honestly chambo needs minutes or he's off, we can't guarantee him a spot over bellerin and there's no way he gets in over mesut and Sanchez/lemar in a front three. We either don't buy a new cm or chambo is gone.

Thus best case scenario is we stay three at the back and we buy a winger good enough to replace Sanchez, and maybe a Ramsey replacement if we don't mind chambo leaving.

12301,"If I had an existing team with decent to good scoring ability, and was looking to add one more person, then it's really hard to judge but Rodman might be one of the best. He adds great defense, and a ton of extra possessions via rebounding. 

If I were to take a championship contender with good shooting and ball handlers already, I'm confident that Rodman is one of the best, because he's the best at providing value without usage: https://skepticalsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image_thumb19_thumb.png

The article I mentioned above describes Rodman as the best ""third best"" player in history. That is, he is the best glue guy ever. He is better than other glue guys by a wider margin than Jordan is better than other scorers, so if you were to do an all time fantasy draft pick, Rodman should arguably be your first choice - you can fill your scorer roles later while sacrificing less. The people listed in the top 5 here are better first options, sure, but a team also needs to fill its other roles, and Rodman is the GOAT at doing so and therefore arguably top 5. 

It's really too bad we don't have RAPM data, which might show him to be overrated or, in my opinion, way underrated. Box score is useless for him other than to note his GOAT rebounder status.   ",nba

The interesting take away for me here is :

1. Women who are good at math don't automatically pursue STEM, which is interesting! Should they be further encouraged? But then there's...

2. Women who studied STEM fields have the same job mis-match as women in non-STEM fields. Which is to say they follow into STEM less than men do.

*So does that just mean we're shoveling women into a field they don't, in the end, want to pursue?* After all, we already know from gender-blind resume studies that women actually have a *better* shot at being hired if the employer knows they're a woman.

One end says its all 'death by a thousand misogynist cuts.' But I don't see how that argument can hold water if women are better represented and more successful in other fields that are still 'traditionally masculine.'",canada

&gt; Harvey Danger was an alternative rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1992 and rose to prominence in 1998 with the iconic single ""Flagpole Sitta"". Released from their debut album, 'Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?', the song helped the group build its college radio fan-base. The band released their last album in 2005, 'Little by Little' (also known as 'Little by Little...'), after the five year hiatus that followed the release of their sophomore album, 'King James Version'. Harvey Danger has a devoted cult following (with many free downloads available from their website) but the band is widely labeled as a ""one hit wonder"", mainly due to limited mainstream radio airplay and a lack of decent record deals. 

&gt; Still, Harvey Danger has attracted U.S. attention due to their critical praise, with the All Music Guide calling the release 'Little By Little' ""a smart and compelling pop album"". In contrast, the band is little known in Europe, the aforementioned issues compounded since the band focused on selling themselves in America (especially Seattle) and thus made it very difficult for fans to get albums in Europe. The original drummer, Evan Sult, moved to Chicago and now drums in the band Bound Stems. For a short-time, he was replaced by Michael Welke, formerly of the band No. 226. 

&gt; As a symbol of the group's close connection to its fans, they published their last album as a free download along with other materials. In 2009, they announced on their website they've called it quits. According to them, their decision was mutual, and they felt the band has run its course. The single ""Flagpole Sitta"" remains popular on various radio stations as well as having notoriety from being the theme song to the popular British comedy program 'Peep Show'.

&gt; On March 6, 2016, bass player and founding member, Aaron Huffman, died of respiratory failure. Read more on Last.fm.

Did you know that men make up the vast majority of homeless people? Men are also the majority of suicide victims, and men are many times more likely to get injured or die while doing their job. This is largely because some jobs are traditionally considered women's work, and others mens work. So men get funneled into dangerous positions like taxi driver, soldier, construction worker. Women get funneled into jobs like receptionist, bank teller, etc.

There is a small percentage of men who are privileged. You cannot point to that tiny privileged group of males and use it to deny men who have no part of it and practically no chance of taking advantage of it. That's the very essence of undeserved discrimination.",canada

12414,"&gt;This is a big one: Income inequality has increased dramatically over time in the US.

This is something politicians really hit on hard, and I don't deny the trend is troubling. But there is also GOOD news economically: The size of the American middle class is shrinking. That may sound like bad news initially, until you look at the data and realize the reason there are fewer people in the middle (and lower) income bracket because people are moving into the upper income bracket.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/25/upshot/shrinking-middle-class.html

What I got from these data:

- The percentage of American housholds earning less than $35K (inflation adjusted) fell from 40% in 1967 to 34% in 2013.  
- The percentage of households in the middle income bracket fell from 53% in 1967 to 43% in 2013.
- Meanwhile, the percentage of households in the upper income bracket (earning more than $100K) increased from from 7% to 22% in 2013.

This tells me that overall, the American middle class is shrinking because people are generally getting richer, not poorer.

Certainly, there's an adjustment in style, and certain players appear to have improved significantly, Sterling being the best example, but I'm still not completely sold. For those who love Pep, every time City played well, it's further evidence of his brilliance. For those who hate him, every time they play poorly, it's more proof he's a charlatan. 

Reality is that he's probably somewhere in between. The objective measure in football is results, and he did about as well as Pellegrini in the end. Not bad, but not exceptional.",soccer

12514,"I liked it. It mixed humor and gravitas very well, and Michael Keaton was a very effective and multi-dimensional villain. I will confess that I did spend several minutes early on in the film trying to figure out how eight years had passed since the battle of New York shown in The Avengers (2012) and this current film in 2017. Did I miss a time ""jump"" in one of the other MCU films? I know Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is set more or less immediately after Guardians 1, and we'll get them all caught up in time for Infinity War, but this seems like the opposite problem. Has anyone out there made a MCU timeline that explains this, or is this an oversight on the part of the filmmakers?
Anyway, I think Sony/Marvel are on the right track with this re-boot, both in terms of tone and action.
Speaking of action in general, I know that most crime (and therefore crime-fighting) takes place at night, but it is so hard to follow fast-paced, rapid-edited fight sequences in the dark. I appreciate when directors find ways to have action sequences happen during the day, and I think that night sequences are fine, but they need to be edited a little differently. Or is that just me?
Night or day, though, it's still easier than watching Michael Bay's Transformer battles, which a fight choreographer I knew refers to as ""filming forks in a blender.""

So this one guy shows up uninvited...from out of town....with his girlfriend in tow.  We felt sorry and interview him anyway, I go first.   The guy was actually fairly nice, a little twitchy, but he seemed to have a large amount of book knowledge.  He was working at an IT Tech school, so he learned the network course material inside/out.  I figured this out quickly but was still impressed with his knowledge and said something like... ""You've got a great understanding of the principals, I would love to see how fast you pick up real world experience"" Thought he would realize I was complimenting him and letting him know he was being strongly considered.  He only heard me imply he didn't have real world experience and lost his shit.  He almost come across the desk at me while yelling about how all of his lab work was ""real world""

He finally settled down and upon conclusion of my part of the interview, he offered to introduce me to his girlfriend in the parking lot.  I declined.

12600,"Here's an account of my first breakthrough Salvia experience (which is also the first trip I've ever had):    
    
Back in 2005/06 I played around with Salvia a few times. It was legal in PA, although the main reason I was doing it was because I was already being drug tested as part of signing up for the Navy. I tried hard to get regular dried leaves to work, but I didn't really feel anything substantial until I got my hands on some 13x extract.    
    
Set/Setting: Friend's House (Basement)  
Time: Early Evening    
    
T+0s: Took a large hit via bong of Salvia 13x extract. I looked around at my 3 friends as I held it in (we were all sitting in a circle around a candle on the floor), and I exhaled shortly after.    
T+10s: Lost track of peripheral vision; candle flame began to smear; tracers accompanied movement.    
T+20s: Was zoned out on a tingling sensation all over my body, along with what sounded like howling wind all around me. I saw the candle flame fall down and disappear, which briefly startled me, until I realized it was ME that was falling backwards, because gravity decided to change on me. I found this funny, so as I was falling I looked at my best friend on my right and giggled.    
T+30s: I didn't know if my eyes were open or closed. I was flat on my back looking up at the ceiling, yet in my mind I was looking down through the floor I was laying on. Gravity got really heavy. I felt as if I was being sucked into a black hole. My legs and torso were stretching out like a piece of taffy, into the floor.    
T+?: I lifted my neck to look at my feet, but I couldn't find them. They were already sucked into the floor, being pulled into a completely separate dimension. This dimension was cubic in shape, yet all sides stretched off into infinity. I was looking at the center of this cubic universe, from which a thin, flat ribbon stretched from one end to the center, did a loop, then continued on to the other end. Upon closer inspection I realize this ribbon was made up of tiny squares with a single dot in the middle. They resembled plant cells, yet instead of containing genetic material, these cells were the building blocks/instructions for our reality.    
T+??: With horror I discovered that my body has already been stretched out all the way up to its waist, and was being sucked into this ribbon, slowly becoming a part of it. I felt for my arms, but couldn't feel them. The floor was up to the bottom of my rib cage now. I summoned every remaining ounce of strength I had left to open my eyes (I guess they were closed), look at my friends, and blurted out a weak, ""help me...,"" to which they all laughed. I then realized I was at the butt end of a universal joke.    
T+???: I felt played. I was devastated. Not only was I about to stop existing, all of my friendships had been a lie. With this I silently resigned to my fate, my eyes beginning to tear up. The floor was up to my neck when suddenly...    
T+?!?!: It stopped! I finally stopped being sucked into the floor! I quickly start feeling my arms and torso again, to which I promptly shot myself right up off the floor, tripped and fell over, stood up again, then nervously paced around for about a minute, afraid that if I stopped I'd be sucked back into the floor again.    
    
Total experience time was about 5 minutes, although ever since that experience I've always had some slight level of disassociation with reality. It was so real it caused me to completely question my existence. Hell, sometimes I ponder if I'm still in the middle of the 
same salvia experience to this very day. After all, time is completely meaningless on salvia.

If I were to purposedly run it with alike people who want to progress and actually learn the raid and get it done, I'd be willing to set 900 for normal, 910 for heroic, maybe even 895/905 assuming only a partial clear, it's enough for the lower bosses if people stick to mechanics. The only problem is that a typical progression raid and a PUG group are at least somewhat mutually exclusive. Not impossible, though! Last week I've been in a casual group (advertised as such) with the min. ilvl 895 and it actually pulled off a very decent 5/9 clear of normal Tomb with little to no derps simply because people listened to advice/tactics from those a bit more experienced.

If the director had wanted to make crowd-pleasing, one-watch-and-done movies like Hacksaw Ridge that look good but don't stand the test of time, he could have easily done that.

But he purposely decided to challenge his audience, to offer a movie that doesn't have a Movie Hero for the audience to attach themselves to, no linear narrative for the audience to turn off their brains to follow, and so on.

There are international political and corporate influences that certainly limit African countries' access to markets.

In my current country, the president just spent who knows how much money re-vamping his giant white statue just 10km from my house, and will pay people to dance for him during his reception during the upcoming wrestling games. 

Meanwhile the Govt last year had to deal with massive teacher strikes because some teachers weren't getting paid enough, and some werent getting paid at all. I think the govt was fine with this because it accomplishes their goal of disrupting the education system. And hardly anyone is analytical+literate enough to doubt the government in this case.

When Lucio 2.0 was announced and released, a lot of people were saying they would be more willing to play Support now.

People saying ""Time to main Lucio"" or ""He finally looks fun!"" were heavily upvoted.

I'd argue some of the Lucio changes were trying to get more of the DPS crowd to pick him up (higher damage, faster projectile).

It's hard to feel it out, Lucio's Play Rate has always been high in comp (and still is). His play rate in QP has always been pretty good (usually 2nd most played, after Mercy). I wonder if it's just the same people though.

12876,"There are two government programs. Medicare which covers pretty much everyone over 65 and Medicaid which covers the poor. The rules for coverage under Medicaid vary widely state by state. 

The general idea in the US is that we'll cover the truly needy, but if you can pay for your own care, you should. But, no one agrees on who's truly needy. Let's take a 25 year old able bodied drug addict. That drug addict can't get and keep a job. So, can he pay, or can't he? One group says he can't pay so the government should cover his care. Another group says he CAN pay if he hadn't made bad choices and gotten himself addicted to drugs. His bad choices are NOT my problem. Whether he can get government coverage depends on the state he's in. 

Kids get caught in the middle. Often, they are covered, but their parents don't bother to fill out the paper work, or get their coverage. As far as I know, most of the time, when kids get major illnesses, hospitals find a way to get them the care they need.

12898,"As a Cavs fan i really WISH that we manage to trade Lebron and Keep Kyrie.

Honestly, what do we hope for keeping a 32.5yo Lebron that will probably leave next summer anyway?

Why would anyone decide to get rid of Kyrie, a clutch superstar, for a player that, despite being the best in the game, will not ensure our short term future?

Yall should all shut up with the No Trade Clause. NTC mean nothing if Lebron ACCEPTS THE MOVE.

Looking at his behavior lately, it's clear that he is bored with this situation and Kyrie creating waves just made it IMPOSSIBLE to build a successful season (meaning, beat the Warriors) even if Kyrie stays.

So, knowing that, what team would Lebron accept to be traded to? A team with assets to give back too?

I honestly only see the Lakers. Lebron ain't going to the Clippers to play with Deandre (We would probably ask for Blake). Not many teams are in markets that Lebron want to build up the rest of his career.

To be honest, even if i HATE the idea, the Lakers seem to be an exit for Lebron as he would probably accept to be traded to LA if they keep Ball and Ingram.

Taking in account that i want to rebuild WITH KYRIE, i would send Lebron to LA for:

- Randle (will be double double machine that gives us rim protection)
- Clarkson (productive SG in good contract - get rid of JR next season)
- Larry Nance Jr (Why not. Young, athletic and cheap)
- Kuzma (yes, i take anyone with potential)
- Deng (to make salaries work)
- 1st round picks in 2019-2020.

Next season i can use any of these assets to get rid of Deng. Even Love could be used this way. 1st round picks won't be worth a lot with LBJ and maybe PG in LA. But they will be good to dump JR, Korver etc.

Anyway, all i am saying is that Cavs are better of getting it over with James. Thank you for everything KING. The Lakers will be a good match for the rest of his ending career and this trade will give us a lot of assets to rebuild in 1 season.

12919,"That would depend on the court and their relations with their subjects. It's not true that pagans had no rights under Sharia in general. Medieval Islamic law organised society around castes with Islam at the top, followed by the Abrahamic religions which were afforded special considerations, to pagans and atheists at the bottom. The way the caste system was configured allowed for upward mobility towards increasingly priviliged beliefs, but disallowed what was perceived as regression. Their rights were more limited and as a whole they had to submit to Islamic rule, but nonetheless they had rights, they were subjects with some legal standing. There are historical precedents for pagans even achieving protected status as dhimmis as well. The Chaldaean pagans, which practiced some weird quasi-Indo Hellenstic Babylonian astrology, are one example. Obviously there was a preference for pagans to convert to Islam, something which was often not true for the standard protected religions. Very similar to contemporary Christian thinking of the time, paganism was seen as a deviation from religious truth. The very first Dhimmi contract, the Constitution of Medina, included pagans as to having rights. Later developments were not charitable.

As for idolatry, every major monotheistic religious institution looked to it as a form of heresy, a subversive reversal backwards to paganism that corrupts the purity of the religion. Thus they were heavily persecuted within Islam, as was the custom of the time. What's quite interesting is that because of the mobility mechanism, religious uniformity was policed also in the protected minorities to ensure that they would not slide backwards into pagan elements themselves. Minorities which already practiced idolatry were allowed to continue to do so in accordance with their customs, unless they were targetted for conversion.",canada

They don't have to bribe them by keeping favored programs running to avoid an election. Action can be taken swiftly and mercilessly, which is frankly what we need.

13185,"I looked into it a little more with Ronaldo's case. People said he paid back for his transfer in shirt sales in less than 2 years.

Well, estimates say that annual Madrid shirts are about 1 500 000 (its a little more now, but let's assume it's the average number since Ronaldo's transfer).
Let's assume a price of 80 euros / shirt. 
Let's also assume that Ronaldo's shirt makes up for half (low estimate) to 70% (high estimate) of Madrid shirt sales.

That means, every year, Ronaldo generates a revenue from 64 to 89 Million Euros. 

But that is only the revenue. Madrid only gets about 15%, maybe 20% tops of the actual sales price. Let's assume 20%. That means Madrid makes between 13 and 19 Million euros from Ronaldo shirt sales.

That means at best, Ronaldo ""paid back"" for his transfer fee in 5 years .... and his shirt sales don't even cover his wages anymore.

However, marketing benefits go far beyond shirt sales. There's the rest of the merch, which adds up. 

There's also the much less measurable but very real general impact on image. When you field one of the all-time greatests, you attract better players. You inspire more fear to your opponents. Rich countries / corporations / emir will pay you an insane amount of money just for a friendly game, or meeting the players, or any small event with the players. And most of all, there's an insane amount of money made from publicity deals.

So people overestimate the amount made from shirt sales, but they underestimate the less visible part of the iceberg of marketing revenue.",soccer

For instance, if I'm telling you a story about my experience with my Tauren druid...

So I was flying along, and I'd gotten to Uldum a while ago. Originally I went there at level 82, which I thought was a little low. My druid is a scribe, though, and I wanted to learn the Origami Beetle. To my surprise I found that the zone wasn't as high of a level as I thought. I started killing stuff, and got the technique pretty quickly, and then staarted gathering whiptail, and was generally having a good time. So when I did hit level 83 I was pretty excited to go back. I've been doing a bunch of stuff, including some fishing -- and some of that sold very well, so I'll keep doing it even though my druid's fishing is only level 300 at the moment so I'm catching lots of crud. But I just did the quest to go into the Vortex Pinnacle. There was a quest to kill Asaad, and I noticed that the experience for the reward was pretty high -- then saw that the things in there are elites, and oh hey, I guess this is a dungeon. Time to leave... wait. I need to jump out the portal, and I'm not really fond of heights. But hearthstone on cooldown, so... here goes nothing. Oh! No big deal, I'm back on the platform thing.

No.

[http://stateofdps.com/](http://stateofdps.com/)

I don't think mages have ever been 'gimpy as shit', they've consistently been top10 which is impressive in a game with so many dps specs. Arcane is currently #1, though that site still hasnt been updated yet to show the new raids.

Arcane is a rediculous return of investment on complexity of rotation vs dps you get out of it. I greatly outgear our mage and he still outdpses me often just because of how hard it is to keep my rotation (as a destro warlock) 100% optimal while handling all the raid mechanics.  And then theres the cooldown management I have to deal with, if procs go off at the wrong time or hero is called for when mine are down..theres no way I'll beat him. Dont get me started on having my biggest DPS cd be a 10min cd that doesnt reset on death, which means only getting to blow it every other pull when learning a fight.

&gt;Only windwalkers if you wanna say they don't have a single better DPS spec, going ONLY by DPS, but really there are a lot of classes worse off all things considered.

&gt;Feral Druids are still not very good and telling them to play boomkin is basically like telling them to reroll. They want to play a melee spec, not a ranged. Oh and survival hunters because they still exist.

&gt;Then you have DK's/Enhancement shamans who do similar damage to rets, maybe 45k-80k more ST according to WCL Mythic Goroth at Max Percentile, but have far less utility and no immunity, which is obviously super important this tier.

&gt;When you take all that stuff into consideration, rets are actually the 3rd best melee DPS, only to be outdone by warriors and rogues, that both just got nerfed. No good guild cares about a DPS margin that small when you bring so much more to the raid. If it's a choice between a ret vs warrior/rogue (before these nerfs) then yeah okay maybe the ret is benched. Ret vs. any other melee? Ret probably gets the raid spot.

&gt;Source: In a top 60 world 7/9M guild, already been benched for avatar (ret is benched too) and will be for KJ as well (ret won't be benched). Also, our ret was slotted for our mistress progress kill when I wasn't and would have been in for maiden too if he wasn't sick because tanks deaths are a thing on that fight, kings can be helpful, and rets do a ton more damage when they stack their damage CD's with the maiden buffs than most other melee classes.

&gt;TLDR: Ret's aren't really that bad.

&gt;Edit: Forgot about Havoc, but Havoc isn't very good either. They only really shine on maiden because they just hold their burst CD's for when they have the maiden buff and do insane damage. Otherwise their damage generally is lower than most melee and the only thing they have going for them is they can cheese some stuff with netherwalk.

[NASA History](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4308/ch1.htm) - This was the introduction of their new Administrator after NACA was dismembered and reformed into a ""*civillian*"" agency which had a DoD mandate (military company masked as civilian). 

The Administrator was a Hollywood Studio Executive and also worked for a film company Ansco/GAF.

&gt;These answers, which circulated via the NACA grapevine late in the summer of 1958, **appalled some NACA employees, did not make much sense to most, and made none of them very happy.**

They had an aeronautics agency with very competent people but decided to put a movie studio executive in charge. Doing that shows video production was more important than the stated functions of the agency.

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/el-fua

I'll leave it around for those interested in a slightly different take:
-----------------------------------------------------

A drunk was interviewed by a news team.  He went on for minutes explaining the concept of ""fua"".  He used to be a seminarist (self-improvement), so it all makes sense.  If you are not a spanish speaker, I have included a transcript and translation (bottom of this post).

http://youtu.be/zROd2y0_F24#t=161

Someone made a nice flash game on fua:

http://www.kongregate.com/games/HectorFV/el-fuaaa

During today's Under-17 soccer final in Mexico City, thousands of fans could be heard saying ""fua!"" as the Mexican goal-keeper would punt the ball (for rivals, it's become tradition to scream ""puto!!!!!!!!!!"").  On the clip below, you can hear the build-up as the goalkeeper sets up the ball, and then....

http://youtu.be/HeT-ztuQ33U

And here is a transcript of the first YouTube clip I shared above...  I removed some irrelevant content from the beginning, and left the last paragraph because it explains the ending to the flash game derived from this meme.

Spanish:

Ya no puedo, pero voy a sacar el fua.  Y lo voy a sacar.  Por que? Porque tengo que dar el extra.  Fua!  Caracter!  Voy y saco!  El fua significa cuando sacas el caracter del estomago y dices, ""Lo voy a hacer.""

""Es que ya no puedo, ya no puedo, ya no puedo.  Como no?!""  Fua!  Fua!  Y saco el caracter, y saco la fuerza, y saco el poder.  Eso es el fua!  No importa lo que hagas.  No importa lo que realizes.  Lo mas importante es el dar el extra.  El fua!  Fua!  Significa dar el extra.

Luz que se proyectas del universo...  eso es el fua!

Cuando las personas ya estan muertas...  ""Ya dejalo muerto.""  No!  No, no, no, no!  Fua, fua, fua!  Y lo revives...

------------------------------
English:

""I can no longer go on, but I'm going to bring out the fua.  Why?  Because I must make an extra effort.""  Fua!  Character!  That's what I bring out!  The ""fua"" is when you take character from your stomach and tell yourself, ""I will do it!""

""But I can't go on...  I can't go on...""  why not?!  Fua!  Fua!  And I bring out the character...  the strength...  the power.  That is the fua.  It doesn't matter what you do.  It doesn't matter what you accomplish.  The most important thing is to put an extra effort.  The fua!  Fua!  It means to make an extra effort.

Light that projects itself from the universe...  that's the fua!

Maybe the first half of the film was a fun ride with new lovable characters (I'm a huge fan of John Boyega and his character, and Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac were great too!). But after a while I just started getting disengaged. You've got the whole Kylo Ren part of the plot without any explanation as to why he is the way he is or how the kid could have grown up so wrong, no deeper look into his psyche... and so by the time you get to the emotional crux of the film, it's ironically both predictable and non-sensical.

But let's look at the high born women we know: Cersei Lannister is our evil queen,  she had princes and a princess and that's done now. 

But who else did?  Yara Greyjoy? No. She became a leader of the family's fleet,  chosen by her father.  

Brienne of Tarth? No. Her father raised her to be a fighter. 

Lyanna Mormont. She may be expected to have children,  but she intends to fight alongside her men, just as her mother did. 

Sansa Stark. Well she's been married twice now and both marriages I would say ended badly,  I don't imagine her marrying ever again. In fact,  she'll likely insist one of the men do so. 

Dany Targaryen. Conquerer and queen. Opted to never bare children age her still born,  and doesn't seem to want to marry again, but will use it as a bait tactic.

Margery and Olena Tyrell were not one for sitting back and letting the men make decisions.  They recognized their role, but rose above that to meet their own desires. It was only one other woman of a powerful house that took that away from them: Cersei Lannister. 

Ned's ideas were antiquated,  much like everyone else's ridiculous idea that Arya in Winterfell means she must marry and bare children. Westeros has changed since season 1, let's stop pretending that everything is just as it was back then.  Remember, they need to train women and children how to fight.

2. 5 hours scattered throughout the day.  Mostly just quick news check during work hours.


3. 3 years on various accounts.  I'd be a pretty good addition because I have lots of css experience through web development and I have a good balance of memeing shitposts and more in-depth analysis.  I follow NBA and college ball pretty heavily.


4. Favorite NBA memory has to be when   Hedo Turkoglu's Magic defeated LeBron's Cavs in the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals to get to the finals.  Turkoglu is my favorite player, and I honestly just laughed my ass off when he got caught for doping later in 2013.


5. Honestly the only thing that needs to change about /r/nba is how fast it's changing.  This sub produces and aggregates an insane amount of content.  With the natural limitations of reddit's algorithm in place, the mods have to make dynamic hot content threads accessible as possible on both desktop and mobile.  For example, the top team subreddit posts section is nice, but too niche and the important shit will get x-posted anyways.  Redirect traffic to something that will catalyze the serious discourse and/or memery this sub does so well at.
