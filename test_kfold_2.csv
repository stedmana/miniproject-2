You meet the girl of your dreams. She's into EVERYTHING you do. You talk about playing video games, and SHE LOVES THEM. You like to rock climb? MY GOD ME TOO!! She loves guitar, and always wanted to learn! She was going to buy a motorcycle this summer already! She's just been waiting until now to get that first tattoo, because she loves them, and has always been really into that! 

Then, after nine months of doing NOTHING but FUCKING, you find out that you two have nothing in common. 

Comics, Blues Rock, Motorcycles, Skateboards, Arcade Games, Playing Guitar, Playing Drums, Singing, recording, writing video games, Painting,Kayaking, Rock Climbing, ect ... 

All things my recent Ex claimed to 'love', and after 9 months of dating, I realized that not only did she not want to be involved in ANY of these activities, but I suddenly didn't have the time for them either. 

The worst part is I'm pretty sure they don't realize they're lying. In the most recent case, it was like anything she would 'claim' to be into, was something she was always into, and had examples of when she started being interested in that from years ago. The problem was that, yeah, maybe she played some pac-man a decade ago, or imagines that playing music might be fun, but if it's something she doesn't do, actively, on her own, when you're not around ... then it's not something you have in common. It's something she only cares about because she wants to be with you. ",AskReddit

I've been working on being more cautious with my PWR charges as well to ensure that I am using them a bit less aggressively and can hold onto them for the largest damage points in the fight, so long as I'm not holding onto them for too long. 

How much you're firing away with applying Atones also depends on how long the encounter is, as you can be very aggressive with applying Atones if the fight isn't going to be super short. 

For SMend I'll generally use it if a target is reasonably low HP and needs some spot healing. Using it on the Spear debuff targets on Desolate Host or just anyone that drops too low. Its pretty high HPS but is just more costly than Plea, so you have to make sure that you're being as efficient as possible with SMend casts to reduce overheal. ",wow

Some might not think this is a big deal, but I do. I'd like to be able to tag people in photos without giving them access to the entire album... sometimes I like to tag people in photos just so **I** can remember who was there.. not necessarily to give them access to all of my pictures.

89,"Because any healthy couple is made up of two individuals, who have their own personalities and voices and needs. The couple as a unit matters, but people in relationships should be *people* first. If they aren't, then they're unlikely to treat a potential partner as a human instead of just a toy. On OKC, your profile is supposed to be about you personally--the rankings and questions and stuff matter, and there's no way to accurately be that personalized as a couple.

And like, if you're really going to insist on diving straight into ""You must date us both as a couple"", that's just not healthy. It's unfair to the third. The couple gets to know each other as individual human beings, but the third isn't supposed to look at them as individuals, just as a unit. That's the difference between a triad developing naturally, and just slotting a third in because you want one.

But yeah, in my experience at least, good poly people are looking for people, super open about their partners and to their partners, and maybe hoping a triad will develop but also willing to date independently. Couples actively looking just for a third who has to treat them only as a couple are almost always unicorn hunting. Not always. But almost always.

&gt; The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo has prompted tributes around the world, but in mainland China, there has been no coverage in Chinese.

&gt; Xinhua and CCTV news issued brief statements on their English sites stating that Liu Xiaobo, &amp;quot;Convicted of subversion of state power&amp;quot;, had died.

&gt; Chinese-language sites appear to have steered clear of reporting the story altogether - a news search of &amp;quot;Liu Xiaobo&amp;quot; on leading Chinese search engine Baidu brings up no domestic press mentions of Mr Liu since February.

I admit I took a strong interest in history and have read a lot about the histories of religions, so I'm not suggesting that ignorance is a solution, but it also suggests that most negative religious stereotypes come from the perspective of other religions.

I fully believe in our attack and midfield we are in a better position on paper. However our lack of depth and our continuity of selling and loaning players is killing pretty much any chance we have at a trophy this year, we lack so much depth, maybe it's the reason Conte stuck with pretty much the same side through all pre season to get them extremely fit for the season ahead.

That's not true.  We can't know for certain what outcome we would have gotten if Canada had been insistent that he be sent back here to face justice from the beginning, but we *do* know for certain that Canada was under no obligation to send our own agents to interrogate him, immediately after he was subject to torture, and without his lawyer present.  That was a clear violation of his rights, an implicit endorsement of the abuses perpetrated by the US, and the nucleus of his claim against the government.

290,"&gt; Most anime is trash today, well most anime back then was trash as well. The quality of anime hasn't changed in the slightest. It's just the fact that you're able to see more that you realize there are a lot of anime you really don't care for. There was a lot of garbage in 1980's, 1990's, 2000's. Those decades aren't solely defined by their greatest anime.

You're missing the point. It's not about the anime today being trash, but the localizations. Fansubs weren't perfect, but they generally were consistent, made sense in the context of the show, and had good typesetting and video quality. Official streams have traditionally had ""professional"" translations that often have distracting mistakes, poor typesetting, and poor video quality. 

&gt; Amazon Prime is not a service I really care for, and I could do without. I don't view it as necessary in the slightest for me. So I hate the idea of having to pay nearly triple the amount of what the service actually costs.

If you only want the 'best matchups' at events, why even invite 16 teams and have a group stage? Might as well just invite 4-8 teams and go straight to BO3 playoffs then. 

Remember when Optic won Eleague Season 2? C9 won ESL season 4? NIP won IEM Oakland? Dignitas won Epicenter? Na'Vi won ESL New York? VP won Dreamhack Vegas? All of those finals were exciting, and not because the ""best 2"" teams were in the finals, because good CS was played. 

Just like in my OP

There is a very high level of parity in professional CS right now. Anybody can beat anybody, and that's what leads to interesting matchups and entertaining CS.

409,"No offense but shit, motherfuckers forgot how good pre-knee injury Kidd was...and even post-injury Kidd was bonkers for a few years.

You gotta keep in mind that Lebron's ability to finish makes the passing lanes that much wider- everyone knew Kidd was going to pass and he still led the league in assists (or was top 3) for pretty much a decade.  It's the same way MJ was able to average a near triple double that year he tried to play PG kinda, even though he clearly wasn't the level of passer his assist totals might make it seem.  When you're a scorer at the level of MJ, passing lanes might literally be two or three times as wide as those that a guy like Kidd might get due to the difference in the defense's focus.

If anything, I compare Kidd to Westbrook, except with Rubio's brain.  The dude was the best rebounding guard of all time even without his team feeding them to him and was Magic-esque on the fast break.

In my book, Kidd is up there with Nash and Magic and Stockton and CP3 (and some guys today like Huertas or Teodisic or Rubio who are on their level as passers but are so lacking in other areas that they can't take advantage, the fact that they're all Euros is coincidence) with guys like Bird, Lebron and even natural points like Isaiah on a tier just below.",nba

You have a lot of effects over-lapping and it seems like, even during clips you make a point to add slows, flips, colour changes. This only makes the video harder to watch and increases your time editing. 
Be more conservative with these kinds of edits as the more you use them, the more they lose their effect.

Additionally, your intro is wayyy too long and really ambiguous. This maybe the result of trying to match the music, but if that's the case you need to find another track, or just cut down the intro, fade in and I literally wouldn't be able to tell the song didn't just start there, and you'd still have your beat drop sinc. Intro should be 15 seconds at VERY MOST, going beyond that only loses you viewers.

The potential for ill has to do with the chance that a troll reports a legitimate player and due to the inevitable occurence of human error manages to inflict a punishment on them.  Reporting a success (or perhaps even just a potential success as is the case in LoL) becomes a positive feedback loop that encourages the troll to increase his volume of attacks.  As trolls collectively increase their volume of attacks, the likelihood of false positives goes up even more.

Bottom line, a solid reporting system may stop the weakest of trolls out there, but committed trolls are always going to find ways around the system and potentially even subvert it to their own devices, and the ones left to bear the burden of such a system are erroneously punished legitimate players.  Just like hacks, you can't really directly combat them because your efforts are only ever going to stop the most blatant offenders, but not anyone with any level of sophistication.",Overwatch
584,"&gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments. The case of Coffin v. United States (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes.

Most modern democracies also have presumption of innocence directly written in their constitutions.

&gt; The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: ""Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.""

All of this taken from Wikipedia with a quick google search.

Your second comment (courts declaring people ""not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"") has nothing to do with your first comment. Presumption of innocence is a real thing, codified in many constitutions around the world, and indirectly pulled from the 5th, 6th and 14th amendment of the US constitution.

Basically, you are *presumed* innocent until proven guilty. That doesn't mean a crime didn't happen.

Civil litigation goes through the same process, it doesn't just immediately happen and the accused party is somehow now found guilty. Even in civil litigation the accused party is still innocent until a judge makes his or her decision based on the facts and evidence presented to him or her.

The NFL is a private organization with their own rules and codes of conduct. Smoking marijuana is legal in California, yet any player for the chargers, rams, raiders, or niners can be suspended for violating the leagues policy against drugs.

If you do go back, try joints or a pipe. You could hit a bong, but it has the capability to really mess up newcomers. I stay away from edibles. My brother and one of my friends split one.

-Slavery and sex slavery;

-Genocide;

-Massacres;

-General oppression of non-islamic beliefs including forced conversions to islam and non-muslims being made second class citizens.

663,"Yes but my point is the longer we wait to buy a striker, especially with other teams in for high quality strikers, the less there will be available and the worse deal we're gonna get. The onus is on us to buy, not the other team to sell so patience and waiting for the right deal isn't helping us near as much as strengthening there position. Player + cash exchanges are exceedingly rare, the simple fact is we're going to have to pony up big cash for high quality players and the board doesn't seem willing, which is especially aggravating when we've sold so many players recently. 

You think if we keep waiting, say Milan buy one of Belotti/Morata and we go for the other, we're gonna get a better deal than now? They'll bleed us dry even worse than they're trying to now, there is little supply and we have high demand and all the teams know that.

Board has been spending cash, but not enough for what the market is now. Not since Torres have we really spent, just looking for bargains and it worked out last year, went from our A choice targets to Luiz on deadline day (who played great but i guarantee wasn't a top 3 CB target for Conte). I understand market is ridiculously inflated but thats something out of our control, all the big teams around are spending and shoring up their team, we easily have the worst striker out of the top 6 without costa and any striker that could put us back near the top would be 70+.

I know Spurs haven't spent anything yet but they've only sold Walker. We've sold Ake and lent out Zouma, countered by Christensen and Rudiger coming in fair enough, but we've also lost Chalobah and RLC, likely to lose Matic as well and only have Bakayoko in. Costa is also gone, and we're down to 14 first team outfielders.

The way the board has gone about transfers this summer is imo terrible. Selling to heavily without any replacements lined up or coming in, I know we're negotiating now and have been throughout but other teams know how desperate we continue to grow as we sell and they're gonna crank up the price and we'll get more excuses from our fans about the price being ridiculous and its good we didn't give in.

[THIS](https://www.berlin.de/sen/inneres/verfassungsschutz/publikationen/im-fokus/im_fokus_linke_gewalt_2009-2013.pdf) is the pdf download for the source material.

* Age: 72% are 19-30 years old. 35% are between 21 and 24 years old.
* Family situation: 91% of them are single
* Living situation: 43% (!!!!) are living with their parents.
* Job situation: 34% have no job, 27% are still in school, university. 47% have a job/apprenticeship
* Education: 29% have Abitur (qualifies for University), 38% Realschule (middle ground) 17% have Hauptschule (may or may not be able to read and write)



59% of their criminal acts have been directed against people, 81% of which were directed against police (15% right wingers, 4% civilians). Left wing crime has, compared to the years 2003 to 2008, doubled in the years 2009-2013.

What we have here, is a sizeable mass of millenial overgrown teenagers, of which more than half does not work or add anything to society WHATSOEVER. Overwhelmingly living WITH THEIR PARENTS.

This is what is fighting the bourgeoisie, destroying the bondage of classes. A bunch of young, single men - barely out of puberty (if at all), living with their mothers. The most overprivileged class in the history of mankind.

Something is seriously fucked up in our society.

In fact, it is just as possible that we'll have *better* relations with the Serbs outside the EU as it is then in their interest to keep up the good relations. Right now, there are few consequences when Orban takes Putin's side or run a propaganda campaign against the EU. If a non-EU Serbia did the same, we could say ""oh, then perhaps you aren't interested in trade anymore?"" Of course, this clearly didn't work with Turkey (to a large extent because we never said that), but imagine the damage if we had let them in instead.

Ok, next time you go to school ask one random person that you encounter if he/she thinks that you're European. I'm gonna save you the unnecessary work, they won't.

Sure, your pals think of you as culturally European, and I mean why wouldn't they, you're just like them, you like/dislike the same things, have the same values etc.

You can't force people to associate that with something else, no matter how racist or hurtful you think it is (because that sure is the impression I'm getting of you).

I don't get the point of you asking ""Do you think I'm European?"" anyway. You're just waiting for someone to say (understandably so) no, so you can be scandalized at it.

&gt; ""You have no fucking clue, do you...?
Everything I say is just ignored because it cant get past your giant overinflated ego. It is a significant problem but you cant see it because you have no empathy and clearly don't even understand the game.""

I can't accept the argument because I have a counter-argument. If I had no counter argument, I would accept the argument. It is as simple as that. 

Why are you arguing the point of whether or not *your argument* should be accepted, rather than the argument itself? That does nothing here other than you personally attacking me. On top of that, I find that it's very hypocritical that you're making the argument of ""over-inflated ego"" yet you won't yield to the fact that this is what you're doing, so much so that I had to ask for a moderator to intervene *whom also sees the same problem that I do with the way you're conducting the argument.* You're making this into an argument about me personally rather than the point, and that has been apparent from the first thing you even responded with:

&gt; The chance doesn't matter. What DOES matter is that it completely ruins the game for one team, and unbalances the game for the other team. But you can't see that because you are blinded by pride.

So please stop.


Moving onto the argument itself, the mathematical chance of the behavior occurring is in-fact a counter argument. To state that it's not is silly. I'm going to make a very simple analogy that will explain why it is silly, and I hope you can understand this one:

Imagine we have two miniature clones of Earth, A and B, that we can observe for testing purposes, specifically two for following a methodology similar to having a *control* and contrasting it with a *variable,* a practice I'm sure you remember from high-school science. 

On each Earth, imagine we can play God, and we possess the power to directly change the percentage of how likely it is for any one person to experience or be grieved by, lets say: terrorism, to any percentage we desire. If we change the entirety of Earth A's population to having a 20%--one in five--annual likelihood of being affected by terrorism, and Earth B's to 0.2%--one hundred times less--this will produce drastically different results for how people carry out their daily lives. 

I assume that on Earth A, overall satisfaction for quality of life would be *far* lower. I also assume that people would go through extra precautions on a daily basis, which would effect how they ultimately lead their daily lives in the attempt to minimize their chances of being affected each day.

Can the same be said for Earth B? I don't think it could be. If I brought forth the example that 65,640,000 people live in Britain, only 131,280 would be affected by terrorism annually on our Earth B. That's not enough to warrant changing your lifestyle. At all. 130,000 out of 65,000,000? Subtract those two and you have 64,870,000. You can't even reasonably feel the difference between those numbers, it's so infinitesimally small. Nothing would change for the average person in your daily life when compared to Earth A.

If, like you argue:

&gt; The chance doesn't matter.

this percent in my analogy could be as high or small as you want to make it, and to logically follow your argument, people would have to act the same in each Earth regardless of the percent. This completely throws your line of logic out of the window. Utterly. It completely ruins it from the de-facto perspective. 

Lets now bring this analogy into Overwatch.

So the main differences between my analogy and what the state of the actual math is in Overwatch, is that the competitive player-base is roughly 120,000 people. Bronze makes up roughly 1,200, 1% of that. Bronze *and* Silver makes up roughly 4,800. This is where most of the frustration occurs for games being thrown, as this is where new account MMR starts, before any comp games are completed. If there are at any given time, a concurrent of 10 streamers doing this challenge, which I do believe is an *extremely* generous allocation of such a number, it works out to be 0.02% of the playerbase of Bronze and Silver which this applies to. This is one-thousandth of the 20% Earth/terrorism analogy, and we determined that one-hundredth was already insignificantly low.

My analogy also deals with something that is irreversible, entertaining results such as life and death. This is an experience which is repairable. It's far less significant than the implications of the Earth analogy, yet it's still enough to be insignificantly low. Not to say that it would ""not be a problem,"" but not enough to seriously change your daily way of life and expected life experience.

If you can't fathom how little 0.2% matters, let alone 0.02%, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J6BQDKiYyM

Just wait until he reaches 100,000,000, take 1/3rd from it mentally, pause the video on 70,000,000, etc, and take away 1 and 1/3rd ""$100,000""s. This demonstrates how insignificantly small what we're dealing with here is. Then apply it to the 1000 times smaller example, not the 100 times smaller of the analogy.

Vuhdo = Way better than healbot or anything else, takes a little set up but google will help you here as well.  I reccomend this especially for resto druids as it is the best at tracking our HoTs with little graphical representations that makes healing a breeze.

Also please make sure that you are using mouseover macros for all of your heal spells, this is so vital for us to be able to rejuvenate people quickly as it i has no global cooldown, but you still see clicking druids who have to click on each individual person to cast on them, its twice as slow at best.

In the elections PIS and PO first won together against postcommunists SLD collapsing because of corruption scandal. And everybody expected them (PIS and PO) to form a coallition, because their programs were almost the same, they both came from Solidarity and AWS party that was a continuation.

But they drifted away, partly because PIS had slightly more votes, and decided to make a coallition (very controversial at the time) with far right LPR and left populist Samoobrona instead of PO, to avoid sharing power with similar big party.

This only lasted 2 years and ended with premature elections because of many crisises in the government (abusing power to wiretap opposition and journalists, corruption and sex scandals in Samoobrona, and PIS believing polls that gave them more votes if they do elections). They did and PO won :)

Then came 8 years of losing all elections, and Smoleńsk crash, and Jarek was the more populist and cynic brother of the two. So they turned into this populist far-right and socialist mix. If you compare quotes of PIS from 2006 and now it's the complete opposite. They praised rule of law and how good our institutions are, denied any ""conspiracy"" during Round Table talks with communists in 1989.

there's a distinction to be made between the two but it's not as though they're totally separate and never interact. the surgeries are just for those trans people that want to bring their bodies more in line with their identity; not all trans people get surgery--some can't afford it or don't have access, some don't care for the results, some don't want to take the risk, and some may feel that hormones alone are enough. so in that sense some *do* simply ""identify as the sex they identify with"" (either with just hormones, or by just transitioning socially--i.e. living as a man/woman as much as they're able to without medical intervention). there's a myriad of reasons they might do this.

How Shaq gets a pass is beyond me though. I guarantee you Shaq believed he was going to win titles in LA before he signed. So it is not like he thought he was choosing between money and winning.

I agree with theaxeasssasin the director is shit, but I just could not stop thinking about this movie for some reason. 

So the way I see it Jonah has multiple personality disorder. One being Jonah who's religious, kind and saved. The other being Buster the hermit Y2K conspiracy theorist. They both wanted to leave but Jonah couldn't leave his family and he was too poor to take him with him. Buster was impatient, so he disguised himself as the drifter from the hotel and used Jonah to help him get money to take their family and leave. After Jonah yelled at Buster in the car Buster got pissed because he knew that Jonah would give up on their dream for his family. So Buster came back appealed to Jonah then betrayed him and killed his wife and daughter. I would say the drifter is a 3rd personality but I'll tell you why I don't think so later.

After the funeral he splits into Buster and Jonah. A year or two passes and Buster either forgets about Jonah or doesn't give a shit until he's on the bike and sees the religious program. Buster knows that being a hermit wasn't the right choice so he comes into contact with Jonah. Jonah went and faked his death and lived on the boat to search for answers from God then gets dismayed. When they met, Jonah tried to kill Buster not only because he hates himself but because Buster killed their family.

Its not much but I think it's better than nothing. I think the psychic was supposed to symbolize that people just hear what they want to hear.

In other words, 2%HP/5 below level eleven.

Not only is Gragas' passive far more potent below level eleven, it's also usable in combat and you can not prevent it in any way. Sure, you have to activate Gragas' passive, but you do that easily with his W which costs 30 mana.

All I remembered was my mom, in her broken English, referring to her as ""ouchie grandma"" because of this when talking to me about her.

I do remember when she left.  We drove a long way to an airport (apparently St. Louis Intl. but I didn't know it then) and fighter jets landed and taxied around.  They were probably F-15s or F/A-18s but it was early in the morning and I was too young to know what kind they were anyway, only that they had two engines and two tail fins, but I don't remember if they pointed straight up (F-15) or slightly outward (F/A-18).  We visited an air museum while there and got to sit in an old fighter cockpit.  It was then a long trip home and for years I always thought it was just in the town a little ways down south.

I'd say no, because the mean of B is skewed by that £60 monster, and £9 wasn't much of an outlier in world A. £26 in B would be well over three times the median price, whereas £9 is just over double the minimum in A.

&gt; Korn (stylized as KoЯn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1992. The current band line up includes five members: Jonathan Davis, James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, Brian Welch and Ray Luzier. The band was formed as an expansion of L.A.P.D. They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde, Skrillex and Nas.

&gt; The band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind, in 1993. Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer's Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996. Follow the Leader is recognized as Korn's mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998, along with the following album, Issues in 1999. The band released Untouchables on June 11, 2002, and later released Take a Look in the Mirror on November 21, 2003, both peaking in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol 1, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. See You on the Other Side was released on December 6, 2005, and Korn's untitled album was released nearly two years later on July 31, 2007. Korn III: Remember Who You Are, the band's ninth studio album, was released July 13, 2010 via Roadrunner Records. In 2011, they released an album called The Path of Totality and with the album, they added sounds and instruments of dubstep with their nu metal sound.

&gt; The Get Up! Songfacts reports that Korn's 10th studio album, The Path Of Totality was produced by various dubstep, drum and bass, and electro house artists due to the band's desire to fuse their traditional sound with electronic elements. released on December 2, 2011 in Europe and December 6, 2011 in the US. Davis explained the album title: ""The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That's how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again.""

&gt; Korn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos.

&gt; Korn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide. Ten of the band's official releases have peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations — two of which they have won (for ""Freak on a Leash"" and ""Here to Stay"").

&gt; Korn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having ""in your face!"" vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California.

&gt; They were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.

Who really wants to fight against TSG or turbo that win by sheer damage? There was even a thread about what comp was most interesting to face on worldofpvp, and most people said RMX in spite of how much people complain about it. 

I'm not saying legion is fantastic, but it would be a lie to say it is all mages and no comp variety.

1467,"""Mainly, I mean that economic development has nothing to do with the way nations are/were classified.""

&gt;What makes a nation third world? 
Despite everevolving definitions, the concept of the third world serves to identify countries that suffer from high infant mortality, low economic development, high levels of poverty, low utilization of natural resources, and heavy dependence on industrialized nations. These are the developing and technologically less advanced nations of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. Third world nations tend to have economies dependent on the developed countries and are generally characterized as poor with unstable governments and having high rates of population growth, illiteracy, and disease. A key factor is the lack of a middle class—with impoverished millions in a vast lower economic class and a very small elite upper class controlling the country’s wealth and resources. Most third world nations also have a very large foreign debt

Justice system sometimes makes mistake and convicts innocent people - keeping them alive sometimes allows those mistakes to be rectified.

Lessens viability of a lot of potential exploitative tactics that apply even in cases of people pleading guilty and testifying to a crime. For example - far riskier to blackmail a person into falsely taking the blame for something by threatening family, when you know you will have to keep that person fearful and compliant for a long time, vs for a few months until they get executed.

Putin is an ex-KGB authoritarian. What is with some people's hard-on for Putin like he's some sort of hero? 

&gt;Democrats have been demonizing Russia very badly recently.

This line is repeated so much it's ridiculous. Mitt Romney was running against Obama saying that Obama was too weak against Russia, if you don't recall. Obama, the Democratic president, tried to ""reset relations"" with Russia during his first term. 

The Democrats have had a firm stance against Russia for two reasons: The election hacking and espionage efforts against the US elections and US itself. 

And the Russian attempts at interfering in the EU and attempting to destabilize Europe, culminating in actions like bribing the Ukranian president to turn down a popularly supported EU-trade deal in favor for a Russian-Ukraine deal. 

This then led to a protest-turned uprising which unseated that government, and served as Putin's justification to invade Ukraine and annex Ukrainian territory and providing anti-air missiles to rebels which led to a civilian airliner getting shot-down. 

&gt;and make someone else do WWIII

No one is pushing for war with Russia that I'm aware of. Sanctions do not lead to WWIII. Economic, diplomatic, and espionage-style retaliation is not ""starting WWIII."" ",conspiracy

This all ruins the replayability of the title (when blizzard tried to force everyone to end-game). We have a lot more nubs at higher levels now (including complete failure to even work towards the objective in battlegrounds), gearscore is a bit of a pain (more-so in WOTLK) for OP DPS classes that could top charts with low GS. Also, now that I have five toons at end-game (and could get a new toon there in 2-3 weeks with casual play), the joys of figuring things out, see and trying new things is gone.    

TL;DR - Can get through the game quickly, effectively, acquire bragging rights, wealth, be above average on my toon an all without even putting in the slightest bit of effort. The game is easy and the rewards are handed out.

1733,"&gt;While that would never be feasible on console,

Except loads of console games already have text chat, and have done so for a few hardware generations now. Consoles first widely supported keyboards (and mice, too) with the Dreamcast and that's continued on through each generation since, either via platform-specific hardware (e.g. chatpad add-ons to controllers) or simply plug-and-play USB. Both the Xbox One and PS4 support keyboards. Games like Final Fantasy XIV, which is cross-play with PS3, PS4, and PC, *rely* on players having access to at least a keyboard, if not also a mouse, in addition to the controller. (In fact having all three is by far the best way to play FFXIV, regardless of which platform you're on; combat is best with a controller, period, a mouse really helps for UI navigation, and a keyboard is near-vital for communication and setting up macros.)  

Now you've also got things like the Nintendo Switch which is hooking up your mobile to handle chat, too.  

On top of that, console Overwatch does seem to already have the chat box in place. If you play against AI, the bots are able to send the usual victory messages (e.g. ""GG :|"") to where the chat box is/should be, indicating that the ability to display the chat is already there.

**tl;dr:** The thing you say will ""never be feasible"" has already existed for years and there's no reason whatsoever for console Overwatch players to not have access to it.",Overwatch

1735,"I don't believing in harming other living things if it is not necessary.  However I believe something being 'necessary' is a contextual decision, and one that there is no absolute standard for. Under any given hypothetical, a decision could unnecessary or necessary based on the circumstances. 

What motivation would I have to treat a cognitive alien species in the same manner as I do livestock? If those circumstances dictated it was necessary, I would not find it immoral. Appending the terms 'alien' and 'cognitive' to a species in no way changes my position on how to treat them. 

I'll side step your denial of God  since there can be no productive (in as much as any discussion is productive) fruit from that line of discussion. The thrust of that passage was to point out that humans have evolved to eat and the eating of meat critical (based on studies done by anthropologist) to our success as a species and the development of cognizance. 

Every dietary association agrees that a 'well managed and informed' vegetarian diet can be healthy at all stages of life. Unfortunately those qualifiers (used explicitly and specifically in scientific papers) disqualify the vast majority of the population from ever falling under the umbrella of those studies (aka those studies are not credible evidence that there is not necessarity to kill animals in order to eat them) . The average  omnivorous human does not have a 'well managed and informed' diet, so the studies done about the '1%' of vegans are not scientifically viable to he used to generalize for the general population. A basic understanding of statistics would show that studies that target specific, self-selecting populations are not useful science for generalizing the behaviors of a larger population. 

So even in spite of my (relative) ignorance on this specific field, I can look at the population sizes of the studies done (one study had ~140 people across the entirety of Ireland) and see they are bad science. 

Any good scientist should be skeptical of any result, especially in today's academic atmosphere of 'publish or perish' and significantly misrepresented statistics. 

In short, there is still a necessity for killing animals, and that is to eat them. Killing animals in order to eat them is not immoral (as opposed to killing them for sport  or for trophies). 


The presence of a brain and a central nervous system are not required for sentience. If you're using some specific, exhaustive definition you need to share it so we can use like terms (and to keep you from moving the goal post) . I already define sentience as 'the ability to feel or perceive things' and then provided the evidence that organic plant matter possesses these capabilities. 

I have no idea what a Chalmers is (Google says he is a philosopher?). I'm not sure what point you're trying to reach here. 

You realize that plants also react to their environment and nutritional needs? Is it because you lack the ability to perceive their responses that you think they don't have one? I assure you if a plant is lacking in water or nutrients you can visually identify that through changes in the plants structure/appearance. 

If neither law nor religion is a framework through which to discuss morals, then how can any moral decision have any foundation? To be more specific, how do you decide that an action is moral or immoral (excluding any religious or law based factors)? Are you arguing for the *innate morality * of an act? I have already demonstrated that absolute morality is fallacious. 

I mean literally by definition, when slavery was legal it was acceptable. In fact, there are moral systems (not yours obviously but other such systems exist) that still allow slavery. While most of these systems have disappeared (and those that do have never allowed colonial style slavery in the first place) some still exist and are wildly popular. I assume by 'acceptable' you meant morally acceptable, in which case yes there is morally acceptable slavery (for me personally). Since your moral system has no foundation (except your personal fiat) I laugh in the face of your judgement. 

Colonial style slavery is morally unacceptable, but that is because of the way that the slaves were treated, not because of any innately immorality of a slave system. The foundation of my moral system is God, and he allows it. The foundation of your moral system (such as it is) appears to be you, and you don't allow it. I know who I will listen to. ",funny

Generally speaking, such sort of expressions are childish. Those officials who use those words, I think they want to show the Chinese government that the Dalai Lama is so bad.

Stirring stuff. Makes me want to internally champion the Tibetan cause while doing nothing substantial at all. 

A bit naive of the Dalai Lama to think that the Chinese leadership actually believes its own propaganda.

1787,"I wish that were the case. You can shut those people up with good performance and putting them in their place when you carry their asses to a win kicking and screaming.

Im going to regale you a tale of the past week of OW competitive for me. And this isn't the first time its happened (though not this bad).

I managed to climb back up to 2450ish, 1-2 games away from plat. Had lots of good matches, close games and highly competitive and fun rounds. I wasn't angry at any of our losses, or people playing sub optimal picks, we all talked and worked together.

Enter sunday: 15 game lose streak. EVERY-SINGLE-GAME, thrower, or a duo/trio that joined up to purposely throw. Now i'd say about 5 of those games had people just tilted, ok w/e just mute em and move on. But the rest? 100% purposeful sitting on the side building torb turrets in the basement. 

What is the response to that? WHAT can i do? The best damn answer anyone can seem to give is to just stop playing the game and play it later? Really? Just stop playing and it'll go away? I wish. Next day was pretty much the same, but as i slipped back towards 2200ish rating the ratio of tilt rised and more and more people just joining up refusing to work together. 

Then today. Today was special. I've played 3 hours so far. Im down to 2000 rating because i've gotten paired up with premades that purposely throw to lower their SR, while tanking mine since our team based rating is roughly 150 higher. 3 separate ""teams"" have done this to us today, i got matched with them different times at least twice each. Took a break, came back oh look another 3 man just throwing great. 

This is the reason i avoided competitive all this time. The fear of people just being shits and throwing games for no reason. I read on here that its never been this bad, but i find that hard to believe. I honestly don't know what to do for this game anymore. Quick play is 100% unplayable and filled to the brim with trolls and try and make the game as shitty as possible. Comp is apparently becoming unplayable the lower i sink into SR due to games that are out of my control. Everyone's answer is to just come back later lol. I'm not tilted, defeated if anything but not tilted. I just wanna play GOOD GAMES, games where both teams are trying and not working on being sad children to each other. ",Overwatch

That got to be stupidest sentence I heard in a while on Reddit (and I go on the Donald for fun). If you are hungry the pain is the same in every country, if you are homeless too.

Salary practices in germany are insane. Minimum wage is brand new (couple years). What do you think will happen with this mounstrous influx of highly motivated, undocumented worforce? That they will pay them 9€ an hour? Think of the competitive advantages of this immigrant workforce for an employer. They even have lower special minimum wages.

Once a sizable part of the low wage workforce will be non declared, taxes revenues will drop, therefore public services. Less police to protect citizens? More Shariah. Less education? Less new business, more shariah, more racism. 

On the long run, Angela Merkel installed a major crisis to come, the state will fail, and when states fail in multicultural states we got wars. The reason is mostly Hubris, Germany assumed it could do BETTER than Europe country with strong immigration population for decades (France, Italy, UK) who faced or are facing those problems.

Since Germany is a country it always assumed it knew better what was ""sehr gut"" for Europe. It always failed and ended up in drama.

Pekka Rinne and Ryan Ellis are UFA's after 2020.

Roman Josi is UFA after 2021

Subban, Ekholm, Forsberg, Arvidsson, and Jarnkrok is a pretty decent core group of players to have signed for $25m all together until after 2022 playoffs. If Saros develops into the goalie we are hoping he will and signs a nice contract with us that makes up for losing Rinne hopefully. Ryan Johansen will hopefully be signing a contract with us soon and I imagine it will be long term so he will be part of that core as well.

Josi and Ellis will be huge losses unfortunately, but I am pretty happy with the way our team is looking for the next 5 years.

&gt; Spoon is an American indie rock band from Austin, Texas. The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer/guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno. Current members also include: Eric Harvey (keyboard, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Rob Pope (bass, backing vocals - replaced Joshua Zarbo in 2007).

&gt; After releasing their debut LP Telephono on Matador Records, the band signed with Elektra in 1998, but the contract was dropped soon after the band released A Series of Sneaks. In response the band released a two-song single titled The Agony of Laffitte (referring to Elektra A&amp;R man Ron Laffitte). Eventually they signed to Merge Records.

&gt; Spoon has been met with widespread critical acclaim. Girls Can Tell, released in 2001, sold more copies than both their previous releases combined. Kill the Moonlight accomplished the same feat a year later. Gimme Fiction was released on May 10, 2005 and continued the trend of increasing popularity for the band.

&gt; Britt Daniel wrote much of the soundtrack to the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. Four tracks by Spoon are also featured.

&gt; The band released their sixth studio album Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga on July 10, 2007; those who purchased the first pressing also received a bonus disc titled Get Nice!.

&gt; Transference is their seventh studio album. It was released on January 18, 2010 in Europe, and on January 19 in North America, to moderately positive reviews.

2037,"&gt; I find the major 7th and minor 2nd much crunchier

Minor 2nd forms a tritone with the fifth, so it'll incorporate some similar dissonance if that's involved or the root note, but then it's also a semitone up from the root, so kind of a double whammy of dischord. No idea what maj 7 adds to that, such a sad/sweet sound (assuming you're over a major chord), but I'd have to hear it in the same chord together or in sequence.",movies

As far as your mental block goes, really, it's just a game. It's easy to lose track of that and go, oh, but ranked is SERIOUS. But it isn't. It's a game, and it's fun.

And you're twisting in the wind as hard as you can saying that I'm judging her VA?

Do you know what the term ""voice actress"" means? Actress. Actresses act. That's probably not her natural voice. It's something she chose to fit the character.

I don't give a fuck about the voice actress's looks when I'm talking about porn between two fictional characters who don't exist. I'm fucking amazed that if I had just said ""voice"" and not the term ""voice actress"" then you wouldn't have gotten twisted up.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

2183,"Is This It by The Strokes

I'm not too sure its ""changed their lives"" by some drastic margin, like saved them from depression or made them into a super-human being. To me, I don't think there's a record in particular thats changed my outlook on life, but maybe it has indirectly. When people say an album ""changed their life"" it's usually because they've put a value on what the album means to them, and have seen the effects over time.

In my case, Is This It by the Strokes I discovered wandering around YouTube. For me, it was my introduction and initiation into guitar-driven music. I heard something that was amazingly good, catchy, and just GOOD. Good music, through and through. Musicianship, artistry... it was everything most pop music is NOT. And it kind of started this thirst to find more artists, albums, genres, of the sort.

Is This It by the Strokes paved the way for me to get really into GOOD music. It showed me that there's amazing stuff that goes, arguably, under the radar. Not only that, but there's amazing music that wants to STAY for the most part under the radar. It's the reason why I like most of the bands I like, the reason why I learned and delved more into music and genres and history, and the reason why I care. It turned me into a goddamn hipster.

Hopefully that will go some distance to help show you how music changes your life. Did it change how I think? About music, yes. About life? In some ways, I suppose. Did it change my life? Well, as music is a big part of it I'd say yeah.

I'd say hell yeah.

Completely true and not a myth at all. Passive football against Dortmund became more and more normal for every year under Klopp. I watched every match by them. There's a reason why we lost 1-0 in every match under Klopp. Almost every team gave zero fucks. They got an early goal by our terrible defense, and camped it out the rest of the match.  You could argue it was a result of us being down for the majority of the time as opposed to other seasons, but it doesn't change the fact that parking the bus happened way more. I have never seen more boring football than that last season.

When landing a plane there is a console known as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system is to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway for landing the plane. Each time the plane strays off course, the system corrects it. The pilot explained that they would land successfully despite ""having been in error 90 percent of the time."" Emery take it from there, stating: ""So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which is correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct, which becomes the next error and so on"" So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag where we cross the true path.""",AskReddit

2360,"Cap has a brain intuitive enough to calculate the trajectory of his throw, ricochet a metal disk off of multiple walls, hit his target and then have that metal disk return to his hand. His brain is essentially a super computer. 

IMO, he should easily have been able to determine exactly how strong Spider-Man was after literally competing in a test of strength with him on three separate occasions. 

Even if he wasn't able to calculate the kid's strength, Cap at least knew that in terms of raw strength:

Cap &lt; Bucky &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Spider-Man 

Since we already know Cap can lift a few tonnes, it doesn't take a super computer brain to figure out that Spider-Man could lift quite a few more considering how easily he overpowered both Cap and Bucky in terms of raw strength.

Point being, silly to say that Cap tried to murder Spider-Man and even sillier to say that Cap had no idea how strong Spider-Man was.

Also, I have a shit memory for details). I do remember that my dad loved it, which was weird. He liked watching movies, but in my entire life I can remember him getting excited for very few, and most of them were James Bond movies that came out before I was born.

Anyway, I never got around to watching it again, unfortunately, and now I'm not sure I could get through it.

My dad died two months ago. While we were going through his stuff, we found a box marked ""stuff Evrythng likes"". It had all sorts of stuff he must have either saved from my childhood, bought because I said it was good or bought because he remembered enjoying it with me. It had VHS and DVD copies of a bunch of movies, some CDs, books, comics, even some toys in it. And it had a both a DVD and VHS copy of tombstone in it. This is a man who refused to buy a vcr because we had cable and he didn't understand why we would ever want to watch something twice, and he remembered enjoying watching tombstone with me so much he went out and bought it twice. 

I have the box sitting next to my entertainment center, but after finding it I can't bring myself to open it again.

Freedom of speech allows for that. While some people are dickish about it, criticism of faith is allowed over a free country and for good reason. It allows science to operate without interference, it allows questions to be asked, it allows for debate, it allows for freedom of religion. You don't get to tell other people what they hold sacred.

&gt; I'm sick of people who tell me we should remove religion from schools

People aren't trying to remove religion from schools. If you want to prey at school... you can. If you want to read the bible or Quran at school... you can. Religions education is important at school and will always remain in schools, though the focus over time has now been from ""Teaching people the religion their parents follow' to ""Understanding a variety of religions and the effects they've had, the beliefs they hold"" it's a more objective approach to teaching religion where things are explain well and are discussed. There are also plenty of Religious Schools in the world, catholic schools, jewish schools, muslim schools which have a heavier focus on the religious elements with the school playing an active role in the practice of the religion.

&gt; ""separate the Church and the state""

Again something very important. The state is supported by the tax payers. Let's take America for example because it doesn't have an ""Official religion"" and has many issues with separation of 'Church and State'. For a start church refers to any religions hand in politics, it just so happens that in the west christianity has had the biggest influence.

Here's America's rough religious breakdown:
* 70.6% Christian
* 5.9% Non-Christian Faith
* 22.8% Unaffiliated (Atheist, Agnostic, Non-Believers, Nothing but Religion not important, Nothing but Religion Important)
* 0.6% Don't Know

All of these groups pay taxes to the state. As a result it would be unfair for the state to then spend the tax money of the non-Christians (Who make up 29.4% of the countries population) on statues and such for religious purposes. To support one religion over the others. It also stops religions from effecting law and using law as a way to mess with other religions. Separation of church and state is the reason why churches don't pay taxes in America because of ""No Taxation without Representation"". By having separation of church from state laws come from a more balanced perspective rather than being based off of faith (Which you might see an issue with) but is an issue in a society that has such a diverse group of people. In America however a large amount of senates are religious and the times they have used tax money to fund religious projects naturally if caught, they've been punished for it because that's now how tax money is meant to be spent.

&gt; and ban religious symbols in public and the Church teaching because it's ""hateful""

If a church wants to build something on their land then thats okay, no one is stopping that. However what people get pissed about (Rightfully so) is the state building religious symbols with tax payers money, the rule is if they do it for one religion they need to be open to doing it for them all... and with the amount of religions there are, that would cost insane amounts and you'd have no space... and thus it's decided that the state cannot erect religious symbols. If you want to wear a cross round your neck, display one in your garden, have one at a church then no one will stop you. If people were to be able to stop that American's would have the train wreck that is the Ark Experience... ironically funded via huge tax breaks by a local down... which are likely to bankrupt the town because the Ark is making huge losses (And he's now cutting staff pay illegally).

&gt; choose their religion when they grow up

While I don't agree with the crowd who thinks parents should never teach their children a religion. I believe you should leave the door open for other beliefs. If your child grows up and decides that they don't agree with the beliefs they were brought up with... then there should be no issue with them changing religion or leaving religion behind all together. Challenging your beliefs is important for both believers and non-believers. Critical think skills are important and following something on blind faith isn't generally a good idea, be that religious beliefs or newspaper articles claiming things. The difference is between forcing and encouraging. If you're encouraging your kids to go to church on Sunday that's fine, it allows the door for them to go ""no I would rather not"" it gives them an option but also teaches values of respect. While I don't follow a religion if a girlfriend's parents do I while I would tell them that I don't subscribe to their beliefs, if they asked me to go to church with them I would out of respect for them. Forcing children to follow a religion however is indoctrination and can get abusive. The key difference is Force or Encourage. Encourage does use force and is done through understanding and discussion. Force is doing without thinking for the other persons actual wants. That goes for if a child does end up changing or loosing faith as they grow up, forcing them out because of that isn't fair. Everyone holds different beliefs even if they subscribe to the same religion and they display them in different ways, to deny someone a chance to choose their own religious path be that one of faith or one of scepticism goes against the idea of personal freedoms.

You want to focus on the Alex Jones statement because it's the only one you have any answer for, but you have to twist my argument to use it in your favor. I wasn't genuinely arguing to trust Jones at all.

I was arguing that a stopped clock is still right twice a day.

So, they got it right. That's great! Why should I trust them on every single thing until the end of time, again?

Feel free to dodge this question as well. Nothing is going to come out of this dead thread but us talking to each other about shit we won't change each other's mind on.

Especially if you can't represent my argument in a fair manner and actually debate based on the points I put forward.

""They've lied before, and issuing reactions isn't enough to trust them instantly""

Is not the same as

""Alex Jones lies so I don't trust MSM""

Really? That's your takeaway? I think you should trust Alex Jones and not MSM? 

Your argument seems to be the exact opposite. Don't trust Alex Jones because he lies and trust MSM because they don't. ""Someone who has always been honest with you,"" are the words you used to make that extraordinarily clear.

My point is simply that I think it's better to wait to form an opinion than to jump the gun because ""muh huffpo sed so""

Don't worry, I'm totally prepared to respond as long as you want to keep going. I just can't believe that someone would so adamantly try to make me trust the mainstream narrative. You've got WAY more than enough on your side. Why don't you want people on my side to exist?

Don't you want to find the fault in your logic? I'm thankful there are people on both sides so we can check and balance each other

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/7203e205d0db49519d45cabd6e575f2b.png)  

&gt; Scars on Broadway is an alternative metal/experimental rock band which formed in 2003 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Jules Pampena (drums), Dominic Cifarelli (bass), and Danny Shamoun (keyboards). Malakian is member of the alternative metal group System of a Down.

&gt; The first song released for the public to listen to was 'They Say' on the 28th March 2008 via the band's website, http://scarsonbroadway.com, and MySpace.

&gt; On December of 2005, Malakian said in an interview that he ""could release ten solo records tomorrow."". He also said, "" I have tons of material laying around. After these albums,"" (Mezmerize and Hypnotize) ""I'm gonna go off to learn how to brain and do something on my own, just like Serj. And no, System of a Down is not breaking up. We're just gonna do like KISS and put out our own solo records.""

&gt; ""Ghetto Blaster Rehearsals"" (2003) was supposedly a leak of new Scars on Broadway material, but in a 2007 letter, Daron announced on his website that these tracks weren't in any way affiliated with the current Scars on Broadway and that the music is from an unnamed disbanded project from four years ago (featuring Casey Chaos on vocals). 

&gt; The band's website featured a countdown timer, counting down to 15:00 PST of March 28, 2008. Additionally, above the timer, in quotation marks was the phrase ""They say it's all about to end."" When the countdown ended, the song ""They Say"" was made available on the site. The song is also available for listening on the band's official MySpace page, it is no longer available for free download.

&gt; Scars on Broadway played their first live show April 11, 2008 at the Whisky a Go-Go in Los Angeles, CA. They have also confirmed to be playing with Metallica at KFMA Day 2008 in Tucson, AZ. On January 22, 2008 Scars on Broadway were announced to be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 26, 2008. On May 17th of that year, the band also performed at the sixteenth annual KROQ Weenie Roast, along with Atreyu, Bad Religion, Flobots, Flogging Molly, Metallica, The Offspring, Pennywise, The Raconteurs, Rise Against and Seether.

&gt; On May 2, 2008, Scars announced on their official website that their debut album, Scars on Broadway, was to be released on the 28th and 29th of July.

&gt; In late 2008, the band entered a hiatus, with Malakian citing a lack of enthusiasm and ""his heart not being into touring"", as the primary reasons for the band's cessation. In April 2010, the band ended its hiatus, announcing a gig which will take place at The Troubador, Los Angeles on May 2, 2010.

&gt; On January 11, 2012 it was announced that they are currently recording their sophomore album and it is expected to be released sometime in the Fall. 
On September 12, 2012 It was revealed that an EP will also come out, sometime around the release of their second album. 
On September 22, 2012 Scars on Broadway performed at the Epicenter Festival in Irvine, Ca. 

&gt; They are now touring with Deftones. Read more on Last.fm.

I wanted to do an audio documentary and interview the old siblings so I could get the full facts on tape but they died before I got my shit together.

It's final! Aubameyang stays with the BVB

The decision has been made: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will not leave Dortmund this summer. The ""internal"" transfer window, which Dortmund imposed on it's striker, is closed according to Kicker sources.

This tuesday Dortmund met AC Milan in Guangzhou, the club which was considered the favorite for a Aubameyang transfer after the China deal didn't happen. According to Kicker sources there were talks between the club bosses, yet a transfer won't happen.

The ""internal"" transfer window, which Dortmund imposed on it's striker, (Watzke to ""Welt am Sonntag"": ""We'll wait a few days, but we won't wait long."") is closed according to Kicker sources. No further talks were held with Milan either.

This means the Borussia will start the new season with the Bundesliga topscorer. Only a unlikely offer of far above 100 mio. € could possibly convince the BVB to change their minds. Aubameyang is under contract until 2020.",soccer

needing 60%+ is bullshit and false because the system doesn't care about your winrate only your mmr.

You attribute that to her like she did it on purpose, when in reality it was a present that was handed to her by Illyrio who was an advisor to her and her brother. The Dothraki marriage was also his idea, and he was the reason she and her brother got the Dothraki army. The Unsullied was handed to her by one of those 'idiot adversaries' I mentioned because he thought he could have a dragon on a leash. She didn't have to fight for that, it it was hardly a clever ploy.

In other words, the three biggest accomplishments you attribute to her can barely be called her accomplishments. She got the second son army because its leader was blown away by her beauty. She got ships handed to her by the Greyjoy siblings because they happened to have no other option. She'd already be dead and poisoned by now in season one if she wasn't saved by Jorah, yet another advisor. Her imprisoning of her dragons was a huge mess up Tyrion remedied. He was also the one who got the Harpy leaders out of hiding and in one spot to deal with. Yet another win thanks an advisor because she couldn't handle enemies she couldn't see. She is by far the least capable leader in the series, and she's gotten as far as she has thanks to luck, stupid enemies, and her stellar advisors. You can be a fan of hers all you like, but acting like she's had it rough is just flat out wrong.

Closing ports to NGO vessels is ever more likely the closer the election looms, as the migration issue is dominating this electoral campaign. Once closed, I doubt they will open again any time soon.

A less obvious effect will be felt over time by various measures the EU (and its member states) have agreed upon. These include but are not restricted to propping up the Libyan coast guard, enacting new rules of conduct for NGOs, maybe even establishing a border force on the Libyan-Niger border (which was discussed this May) or migrant camps in North African countries.

The EU can do plenty *if* the member states agree to do something. The last bit is of course where most attempts to do something fail. 

I still base my hope on the fact that national leaders understand another migration crisis spelling the EU's end. This might force them to agree to harsher measures or grant the EU a more powerful mandate. While the ECBG remains harmstrung by the member states, the basis for an effective border force exists. It ""merely"" requires a slightly stronger mandate and a mighty increase of its budget and permanent personnel.

--------

One idea which could be a true gamechanger is a liberal-conservative, pro-EU movement. I personally imagine it to be a true votecatcher to flaunt European unity and a more restrictive view on migration. 

To disentangle the EU from compulsive progressiveness will be a necessary undertaking if it should ever represent the peoples of Europe, simply because quite a number of Europeans are not progressive.

Let me keep this simple. Climate change is creating more extreme weather such as longer, hotter, and drier weather during summers. These conditions improve the odds that when a person causes a fire to ignite that it will take hold and expand.

Sure, they were funny to make fun of and sometimes very simplistic, but it was that voice that was so universal and relatable to some of us that were feeling real emotions like this. I promise you, as someone who has been there before, the feeling of hopelessness that comes with a disease as cruel as depression leaves wounds that really don't heal. You look back even long after recovery and feel desperate to find a way to tell your former self that there is a future for them. And some of us never recover. 

I cannot begin to imagine the pain Chester went though, and the suffering his family feels in this moment. The blame for him leaving his family behind must be placed solely on the disease that claimed his mind. Suffering in this manner isn't a joke, or a meme. It's a reality for so many more people than we possibly realize, and talking openly and candidly about these emotions and feelings are the only way we could ever hope to incite real change in the perception of mental illness.

Presidential pardons can cover any federal crime, can be preemptive (Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for any potential crimes, even though Nixon had never been charged with anything, and Nixon never admitted any guilt), and can be given to any American, including family members(Bill Clinton pardoned his brother for drug convictions).

Whether he can pardon himself is a more complicated story. It's not explicitly prohibited, it's never been done (obviously), it would probably be political suicide (though who knows with Trump), and it would certainly be challenged in courts. It comes down to common law questions. You cannot serve as your own judge, a pardon is something given from the President to someone else, things like that.",worldnews

Got an important question, how to manage my songs from the phone.

What I'm doing now is for every song put the name of the Anime as an artist and in album put ""anime""

But the problem is that when I have a full album of japanese songs which aren't from a specific anime, they won't be played together...

I thought maybe change everything to something more reasonable:

Artist's name in Artist (As in GARNiDELiA, ClariS and such) and in the album put the album name or if it's a single song or those I don't have the rest of the album- the name of the anime

Maybe.. But every album has its own pic

So if I have a KonoSuba album I'll gladly put a pic of Konosuba

But what about Kuzu no Honkai for example? Choose the pic of the album or Kuzu no honkai pic..?

3460,"I would argue that it is outright collusion.  Draitsaitl is the hot topic these days, but strategic RFA offer sheets are much more likely to be successful if you pick the right player and the right team who is up against the cap.  The fact that it NEVER happens should tell you everything you need to know. 

For example:

* CGY has about $9.8M to sign 5 forwards.  Lazar and Bennett can very likely be had for less that $3.9M AAV, especially on a short-term bridge deal.  But the cost of this would be a second round pick and both players are better than a second round pick.
* NYI has about $9.4M to sign 2D and 1F and they are desparately trying to free cap space to re-sign Tavares. DeHaan could also be had a bridge deal.

The point is, it doesn't have to be a Weber-level deal to shock the world and improve your team.  But nobody is willing to be that ruthless to improve their team, and the middle-level players are losing out.

asked him to lie about the decision, and say that it was a mutual agreement. (It wasn't, Don grew up a Red Sox fan, and loves them, in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if part of the reason he choose a NL team was so that he wouldn't have to commentate against his favorite team very often.) Don himself said that they asked him to do this, and that he refused.

All I know is that Don handled the whole situation with the absolute class, and until his final game was the same Don Sox fans had known for the last 15 years, never once making it seem like the announcement was made public 2/3 of a way through a losing season. NESN looked like fools in the end, and honestly, many people are still bitter about it (including myself)

&gt; Deaf Havana are an English alt rock sextet from King's Lynn in the UK. The band was formed in 2005 at the King's Lynn campus of The College of West Anglia. The band's early releases along with constant touring developed a strong fan base in the UK music scene. The name Deaf Havana came from their former guitarist Sebastian Spitz, but the name itself has no literal meaning.

&gt; Deaf Havana was formed when the original members met at the King's Lynn campus of The College of West Anglia. The bands roots can, however, be traced back much further with Ryan Mellor, James Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson all attending Smithdon High School and playing together in Various local scene bands. At college, these members were joined by Tom Ogden and Sebastian Spitz, this early lineup saw James singing and Ryan taking guitar/unclean vocal duties.
The band quickly got down to writing songs and an early 7-track demo, titled White Lines But No Camera, which was recorded August 2006 at the Lodge, Northampton. The band toured this lineup until the departure of Sebastian and the introduction of Chris Pennells, formerly a member of the band ""Something About Dave"", who took over guitar duties. 

&gt; In late 2006 the band began writing songs for their debut EP, entitled ""Evangeline"". Two songs were roughly recorded, titled ""The Smiles Were Forced"" and ""Where It Begins"", which were uploaded on to the band's myspace page; open to opinions and criticism from their rather small fanbase. The EP was soon recorded and mixed (with ""The Smiles Were Forced"" being dropped from the EP's tracklisting). The EP saw the light of day at the beginning of 2007.

&gt; Around the same time, Ryan Mellor handed over guitar parts to James, and took on the role as front man.

&gt; October 2007 saw the band begin work on the songs that would become their first release.
On the 21st of June 2008 the band announced the signing of a 1 EP 2 Album deal with Wolf At Your Door Records as well as the recording date for their debut E.P.

&gt; The E.P. was eventually recorded by Jonny Renshaw from Devil Sold His Soul and was mixed by Matt O'Grady (You Me At Six, Architects). In October 2008 the band released this recording through their label, the E.P. titled It's Called the Easy Life received strong reviews from various musical publications. On the back of this success the band begin to receive some recognition. January 2009 saw the band complete a UK wide tour with We Are The Ocean - The Urgency, and around the same time, release their first music video for ""Oh Howard, You Crack Me Up"".

&gt; On the 25th May 2009 the band entered the studio to record their debut studio album. The full-length titled ""Meet Me Halfway, At Least"" was released for exclusive pre-order from Wolf At Your Door Records on 7th September and was released on iTunes and shops on 5th October 2009.

&gt; There has been two singles to date that have been taken off this album. ""Friends Like These"" was released, with exclusive B-side ""Hey Baby, This Is Our Song"", on 17 August 2009 for digital download through iTunes and other online outlets. A video was also released on the likes of Scuzz and Kerrang! Their second single, ""Nicotine And Alcohol Saved My Life"", will be released on 15 March 2010 for digital download. With the single, there will also be a remix of ""Friends Like These"" by Essex-based 6 piece, Kenai. The video was released on the music channels and online on 22 February 2010.

&gt; Before the release of the album, Deaf Havana embarked on the ""Metal Hammer Introducing"" Tour along with Young Guns and The Casino Brawl. This tour took them all over the UK. A week after the last date, Deaf Havana played a home town show in King's Lynn as an album release party. Support for this show came from Underline The Sky and All Forgotten.

&gt; 2010 see's Deaf Havana on several tours across the UK and Europe; A headlining UK mini tour with All Forgotten and Francesqa in March, a European tour with Emery in March/April, and a support slot on Emarosa's UK tour in May. Just before the start of the mini tour with All Forgotten, it was announced via the band's myspace and facebook, that Ryan would not be embarking on these future tours with them due to personal problems. To take his place on the tours, Deaf Havana enrolled Max d'Albiac from a band called Brides.

&gt; On 10 May 2010, it was announced via the band's Facebook and Myspace, that Ryan would unfortunately be leaving the band due to the same, unresolved personal reasons that caused him to pull out of the recent tours. Deaf Havana would be continuing on as a 4 piece. As a result, they are getting rid of all screams in future releases, mainly because they feel it would be wrong to replace Ryan.

&gt; The band have already started to write the follow up to 2009's ""Meet Me Halfway, At Least"". A few days after announcing the departure of Ryan, Deaf Havana released a new demo track on Myspace and Facebook, entitled ""My Life Is Average"". This saw the band going back to how they were before the line-up change in 2006, opting for a softer sound, yet still incorporating the sound they had established over the previous album and EP.

&gt; On May 29 and May 30, 2010, Deaf Havana played on the Kerrang! Introducing Stage at Slam Dunk Fesitval at University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield and University of Leeds respectively. At these shows, the band opened with a new song, of which the title wasn't revealed. On August 7, 2010 they will play at the Hevy Music Festival held near Folkestone, Kent.

&gt; On the 19th of May the band released the video for the song 'The World or Nothing' from their new untitled album, the song is not a single and isn't released as a download, the song furthers the band's progress into a new pop punk sound.

&gt; Fools and Worthless Liars was released on the 7th November 2011, coinciding with London Barfly and Norwich Arts Centre release gigs. The album peaked at #1 on the BBC Rock Album Chart. In late November and early December the band toured Europe as direct support to Skindred before returning to the UK to support Architects on their tour through mid December. The band are to perform their own UK headline tour through April 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

3558,"Back in 2000 I studied Environmental Chemistry under professor [Stephen Lincoln](https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/researchtuesdays/2011/06/01/stephen-lincoln/) of Adelaide University. Of all the academics I studied under, this man impressed me the most with his intellect and teaching ability, and he taught that the whole global warming thing was simply part of a natural process, various reasons why CO2 couldn't be to blame, etc. We were examined on our understanding of that, too.

So, fast forward to recently and I was reflecting on that experience. I looked up the old prof to see what was up – surely, if he was still employed, he would have capitulated to the 'consensus' narrative. But, to my surprise, not only have his opinions remained intact, he's now dean of the Environmental Chemistry faculty (previously inorganic chemistry) and has authored a tome titled [Challenged Earth: An Overview of Humanity's Stewardship of Earth](http://booksplea.se/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=1508490&amp;google=AUD).

It was rather incongruous, so I went and searched to see what the environmentalists were saying about him, and they are basically invalidating his opinions by calling him a 'nuclear shill'. I.e., his belief is that nuclear is the way to go. That seems smart to me, especially in Australia where there aren't ever any earthquakes and there's plenty of geologically inert earth where nuclear waste could be stored safely.

Anyway, that's my 'cool story' :)",conspiracy

After that its all rather minor things. A decision with Leo (2.9m) is likely the hardest one, but Moore, Leivo and Carrick would headline the UFA/RFA after that. 

So cap space becomes available and a 1 year Thorton becomes a possibility (32.3M of space available as of today), especially considering Bozak (who is very weak defensively) is gone. Babcock knows Thorton and his abilities. 

I honestly do not know if it will happen, but the Leafs will likely be looking for a rock solid 2 way 3C to replace Bozak, unless they have Nylander switch to C and push Kadri down the line. You can see that it is indeed possible that they pursue Thorton as they were rumored to be doing so this year, but the big difference is that next year they will have the cap space and an open roster spot.

3645,"I don't really know much about shadowpriests, but I've looked a bit at logs for you and the top people for your ilvl. 

First of all, your opener is a bit different from others. It seems opening with Vampiric Touch (start casting before pull so it casts right as the boss is pulled) then Shadow word pain into double mind blast and then double mind flay. But that might because of procs from trinkets or similar. 

The glaring issue though is that  you're casting less of everything than people with same ilvl. Either you haven't learned how to stagger your movement to cause as little downtime as possible, or you have too little haste. (or maybe even you just sit still and don't cast anything here and there, but I don't think that's the case) 

For example on Gorgoth you did 40 mindblasts vs a top logs 63, and his fight was shorter than yours. On that note your mind blast damage did a lesser % of your total damage than it did for him as well, (6% vs 15% roughly), so here's probably the case of prioritizing wrong abilities. 

It's not too easy for me to see what you do wrong because I don't know how abilities interact and what is RNG and similar, but for you I think it would be very interesting to pick someone around the best in the world (for your ilvl) and see how they play then go back and see how you played the same fight. 

https://howtopriest.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=9804 interesting forum post about haste. 

Another thing I noticed was that you spent a lot less time in Void Form than him. Possibly related to haste, but if you want to improve I suggest throwing away any notion that you're doing 250k less dps because of poor legendaries or other things out of your control.

Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

The flames are less physical on the offensive side of the game they're a more skilled based team with little to no physical presence. Edmonton right now has a really good mix of skill along with physicality and this year proved they can beat teams in a multitude of ways. Calgary can only win one way because all their forwards are the same type of players. Edmonton has the diversity to be able to play however they see fit. The Ponda curse to me is much less about being cursed while playing in Anaheim because it's obvious that the flames are not built to be able to beat a big physical and frustrating team like the ducks. ,hockey

I agree, that is wrong and the drive for assimilation was terrible 



What was half decent about 
&gt;taking children from their families

was that a lot of these families are incredibly dysfunctional for a myriad of reasons and leaving a child in a situation where abuse (physical, psychological, emotional) can occur is not good for the child. 

There are so many cases of FAS in the aboriginal community that you cannot tell me that keeping these children with their families is best for the children.  

There ***should*** be a boarding type school available for FN children to go to so they can meet other FN children and develop connections within the FN community rather than the FN community balkanising themselves. 

There is nothing wrong with offering room &amp; board &amp; education for those who wish to access it.

3800,"I guess I should've phrased it a bit better, maybe something other than ""nerf"" perhaps. I'm mostly thinking that while Roadhog wasn't inherently unbalanced, he wasn't exactly much fun to play against. Never felt good to be 2 shotted as D.Va, Reinhardt or Winston...    
    
I don't think old Reaper was bad by any means (even before the buff he could still be a menace to the enemy team), but Roadhog's higher damage, longer range, higher health, ranged crowd control and powerful self heal didn't really give Reaper any particular edge over Roadhog - he was considered bad for no fault in his kit, but that there was a hero better in practically every way than him.    
    
I guess alternatively you could reduce Roadhog's fire rate and magazine size (so that he's a slow but powerful Tank)? Would also make him more unique.    
    
(about the Take A Breather point(s) - the healing is the main bonus. It means the Healer(s) can heal a different teammate while Roadhog can handle himself. The 50% damage resistance combined with the 300hp self heal will allow Roadhog to negate certain abilities - using Pulse Bomb on Roadhog as he uses Take A Breather will allow him to heal a net 100hp instead of taking a net 100 damage. Genji's Dragonblade and Reaper's Death Blossom will be even less effective than they are against Roadhog. That and Roadhog has flat out higher health than Orisa while having a similar hitbox. While I can't be sure yet, I don't think it should be underestimated so soon.)",Overwatch
3801,"&gt; Let's take the technology ranking. You can see that the University of Toronto is 24, Waterloo 47, and McGill 76-100.

In every single ranking in every field, the best Canadian university is lower on the list than several American universities. There isn't a single broad subject in higher education in which Canadian universities outperform American universities. 

&gt; One thing about university rankings is that the universities at the top are virtually indistinguishable from one another because they're all so good.

Utter nonsense. They're apparently not indistinguishable considering there aren't many spots where universities tie. The ranking system I linked to does allow for ties though. If it were the case that all those universities at the top are equal, then there'd be more ties.

[Let's look at the field of physics.](http://www.shanghairanking.com/SubjectPhysics2015.html)

The US has almost all the top spots. Canada's best university, the University of Toronto, is in 44th place. Are you saying that the University of Toronto is actually just as good as the top universities like Harvard and Princeton? To make that assertion would indicate that you're either incredibly delusional or willfully dishonest.

You seem pretty desperate for mental gymnastics to obfuscate and explain away facts that you don't like. Canadians are so accustomed to hearing nothing but negatives about the US and positives about Canada, that when someone provides evidence that shows the US outperforms Canada in a certain area, Canadians basically wig out and can't rationally and sanely respond to it.

&gt; the average Canadian university is better than the average American university.

Lol. Let's translate: ""Even though American universities lead the world in every field, I'm going to warp the nuance of the discussion and boldly claim that, according to my own metrics, Canadian universities are ACTUALLY better, because that's what I want to be true and what I want bedevils my sense of reality!""

&gt; Fact is, Canada's higher education system is world-class and has nothing to envy to America's.

Canadians have such an all-encompassing, overcompensated inferiority complex that dominates their perception of reality so strongly, that they can't admit anything positive about the US. If a subject doesn't allow you to pretend you're better than the US, your brain shuts off.

It's all crits, but I don't believe its dot ticks.  Its not every time, but its a good precent of the time.  So basically we are the only tanking class with a really high amount of crit.

Druid tanks are easy to learn a rotation with, gearing is pretty simple, and lately, Blizz has put in the 2 and 4 piece set bonuses something for bear tanks so now teir is a good option when in wrath it wasn't as much.  What was interesting to me was 2 items that were the same item level, One was a rogue cloak, and the other was a tanking cloak with dodge on it.  The Rogue cloak actually offered more dodge % from the agility than the typical tank cloak with dodge on it.  So thats one thing to take into consideration.  Sometimes the ""tank"" item for your back, ring, relic slot isnt always the best choice.  And certainly any tank item with parry or block is useless.",wow

Ultimate Pete does make it with a load of hotties funnily, but the one thing they all have in common is they're all outcasts too. If a nerdy kid watching this spidey trilogy Marvel are doing needs to see him get with a smokin hottie in order to feel better, maybe that's not a message that's even gonna help in later life anyways. life doesn't get better. It's grim and dark and full of assholes, trumps and haters.

I just think maybe it doesn't matter that Flash isn't a jock and is smart. He's still a rich, popular asshole douche who bullies Pete. This is a school where the hottest and most popular girl is also in the nerd team. I kinda like that because it reflects the value that being intelligent is no bad thing in and of itself. With the rise of anti intellectualism in the world at the moment, this is a more important thing to portray on screen than aspiring to be with the hot girl.

Maybe modeling the fact that Peter, by virtue of being a truly selfless hero, can win over a fully formed human woman with a personality instead might have more value to teach both young boys and girls watching.

On another note I do recommend ultimate spidey, it's got some pretty cringey Bendis moments in there but overall I found it a gripping series because they tried new things never before seen in Spiderman. I got the marvel unlimited app and read it all alongside ultimates and ultimate xmen. ",movies

First of all he has to think about adding players to fit into the team's offensive and defensive schemes. Not all players are ideal matches for your team. 

Secondly in order to field a full roster, he has to account for filling every position which means you're  drafting players who wouldn't necessarily be first or high second round draft picks, i.e. a long snapper or punter, etc.

If you're not drafting for those positions as well, instead filling those roster spots with undrafted free agents, then ultimately several of those 52 picks would be cut anyway.",nfl

A pet-peeve of mine for this series is I BELIEVE Shinsou deserves a spin-off.

I don't know how far the mangaka has already fleshed out the universe's future, so a concurrent spin-off narrative might be difficult, but Shinsou's struggle against stigma and his development would be such a good basis for a shounen-drama or seinen story.

* He would probably train under Eraserhead, go through a training montage like Deku cause physical fitness is a basic must-have for heroes, and customize his own Batman-esque utility belt and mask (a built-in adjustable voice-filter would help him trick people into responding)
* Exploring the advanced ethics of his quirk - like what crime scenarios he should avoid using his quirk even if it would be a quick resolution
* Get accused of some horrible crime and have to prove his innocence without relying on his quirk cause the victim(s) is traumatized or comatose and can't be questioned.
* Deal with low-key harassment as students outside of his class or those who outwardly support him potentially start being passive-aggressive or secretly disgusted
* Discover new limits to his quirk and have the surrounding stigma deepen to counterbalance the power-up.
* Meet a charismatic nemesis/rival whose made it their goal to ruin Shinsou's reputation... (Possibly someone else with a mind-control-type quirk)

I want to see him overcome all that inevitable adversity and keep hold of his own dream of being a hero (edit: or not, maybe face despair and then later renew his conviction! That could fit his story, whereas it wouldn't fit Deku's story)

On the surface, he initially comes across an an intelligent and articulate guy because he forms coherent sentences, supplies links, and writes fairly well in paragraph form, but the second you get into an actual debate with him, you start to realize that appearances can be deceiving.

He continually ignores all points that contradict his preconceived beliefs, he brushes away any and every one of his opponent's arguments, no matter how logical and factual it may be, he posts a million and one straw man arguments in an attempt to discredit his opponent, and he resorts to childish insults. He is too proud to admit when any of his claims are incorrect and he is the type who always has to have the last word in any debate.

&gt;*""Jewish Palestinians were given land under the United Nations Partition Plan in November 1947. They were a minority population given a majority of the land.

In fact, his tour stopped at a venue like 20 mins from my house, but I was busy that night. I wish I could have seen him. 

Let's see, my favorite all-time album is Face-Off by Pastor Troy. I listen to every single song on that album and it also has my favorite rap song, Vice Versa. His voice, the way that he is on the fence with God and the devil and his beats just make it complete. P. Troy is a grinder and, with the exception of one album, he makes music purely for the fans. I love Lil Wyte and Doubt Me Now is pretty awesome. He might as well be a junkie, but he has a lot of force for a little white guy. Marshall Mathers LP, absolutely.

4177,"I've got a couple things to say to that. First, the ""approaching full employment"" claim. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are 6.8 million unemployed Americans and 6 million job openings. Those numbers are pretty close together and unemployment is going down so that's good right? But then add the 1.6 mil that didn't look for work in the 4 weeks prior to survey and so aren't ""unemployed"", another half mil of people who simply aren't looking because of a perception of low job availability, and the real kicker: ""The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), at 5.3 million, changed little in June. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.""

Part time employment isn't enough to get by and it's not exactly stimulating the economy. These statistics also ignore people who are working multiple jobs. This also ignores the rising cost of education in order to qualify for jobs that provide reasonable benefits and have room for advancement.

My absolute biggest gripe is that we don't even *need* ""full employment"" in this ridiculous country. Productivity per worker per hour has grown at an astonishing rate over the last century (four decades even) and advances in efficiency and automation are only going to improve that. But compensation for that productivity has lagged far behind so buying power per work hour has stagnated for [at least fifty years.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) We're at a point where we don't actually need everyone to work in order to provide for everybody's needs, we just have a ridiculous social hangup against ""handouts"" and ""welfare."" We could cut the work week for almost everyone to twenty hours, employ everyone, and still be more productive than at any point in history, while giving every single American a higher quality of living through decreased stress and more time to explore other interests. When people don't have to work all day to survive they invent things, they philosophize, they make art. They do all of the things that have made the great classic civilizations interesting to study.

4208,"#Random Non-Buccaneers Thoughts

Here are ten random non-Buccaneer thoughts.  

1.	Andy Dalton will a darkhorse MVP candidate. Mariota too. 

2.	When Brett Hundley came out of college, I had a 1st round grade on him. I stand by that assessment and believes he’s a great QB lying in wait. On the subject of backups, I think at some point this year the Bills may take a look at Cardale Jones and may be pleasantly surprised.


3.	Jared Goff is going to be a great QB in this league. Fans, especially those on r/NFL have been quick to write him off. He’ll benefit with the addition of McVay. Speaking of 2016 picks, don’t dismiss Laquon Treadwell yet. Despite the poor rookie season, I think he’ll turn it around). 

4.	Patrick Mahomes ends up the best QB from the 2017 class and will become the next gunslinger in the vein of Favre/Stafford/Cutler. 


5.	Browns are going to finally escape bottom dweller status. That offense is going to be better than you think it is, and they have just enough pieces on defense now that they’re going to pester a lot of teams. I think they have a 5-11 floor and a 9-7 ceiling, but they’ll be competitive in every game. 

6.	The AFC Championship Game will feature the Titans and the Patriots. The NFC Championship Game will feature the Packers and the Giants. You know where I’m going with this. 


7.	Demarcus Ware is retired now, and with his retirement, you’re about to be introduced to Shane Ray, who may be in the running for DPOY this year. 

8.	If Kenneth Dixon stays healthy and gets more touches, he’s going to be a beast in Baltimore. 


9.	This is Tom Brady’s final season. But actually. 

10.	The hottest seats in football belong to Todd Bowles, Chuck Pagano, and Jim Caldwell. With the (stupid) firing of Dave Gettleman, you can now add Riverboat Ron to the hotseat too. Because Jed York is an idiot, Kyle Shanahan can also be considered a hotseat candidate. 

#Grading the Writer: Revisiting the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of my 2016 Predictions. 

Here's a link to the [2016 predictions post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4nq9ay/offseason_review_series_tampa_bay_buccaneers/) I reference below. 

*The Good*

**Projecting Jameis Winston's Stat Line: ""Projected Stats: 4,324 yards, 60.4% completion rate, 28 TDs, 16 INTs.""** Actual stat line: 4,090 yards, 60.8% completion rate 28 TD's, 18 INTs

**Projecting Mike Evans' Stat Line: Projected stats: 87 receptions, 1,328 yards, 11 TDs.""** Actual Stat Line: 96 catches, 1,321 yards, 12 TD's

**""With ASJ’s piss poor attitude and immaturity, I think Brate will take the starting TE role...The possibility of Cameron Brate supplanting him [ASJ] as starting TE is strong, and I wouldn’t be surprised if ASJ is gone by season’s start. I think Brate comes out on top here, with ASJ possibly being traded.""** Well, that dick head got cut. 

**On Donovan Smith: ""Donavan Smith had an extremely tough job last year, stepping into the LT spot as a rookie and having to protect the blind side of a rookie. Smith looked slow, lost, and seemed to get penalties at the worst times...The jury is still very much out on Smith, but I was hoping to see more flash. r/Buccaneers is pretty high on him. I’m not.""** Smith finished 2016 with a PFF grade of 42.0 overall, good for the 69th ranked tackle. The step forward we were hoping to see in year two did not happen. 

**On Verner vs. Banks: ""I think one of these guys winds up off the roster, and I think it will be Banks.""**

**On our projected season record: ""Last year [2015], I projected we would go 7-9. We wound up 6-10 so I wasn’t terribly off...we’re going to go 10-6 this year [2016]""** Off by one game the last two years. But was pretty close on this one. 

**On Lavonte David: ""We saw the best of Lavonte David when Bill Sheridan allowed him to have more free reign in blitzing and dropping into coverage...We’re excited for Mike Smith’s scheme, as it will give the opportunity to capitalize on Lavonte’s underrated strength as a pass rusher. I think he’ll return to top form this year.""** Sure enough, Smith's scheme let David return to All-Pro form (which hopefully the AP will recognize). He was all over the field and looked like he was back to top form as a pass rusher. 

**On JR Sweezy: ""...but in Sweezy, we overpaid for a guy who most Seahawks fans would say was a huge liability for them. PFF rated Sweezy the 66th overall guard with a 46.0 grade. Not exactly awe-inspiring.""** Sweezy never saw the field due to injury, which allowed Pamphile and Benenoch to learn by fire and test their readiness. Both had their pains, but the Sweezy signing was pretty bad, injury or not. 

*The Meh*

**On Brent Grimes: ""We paid the right price, and while I don’t see him returning to top tier form, he’ll certainly be less of a liability than Mike Jenkins or Tim Jennings were last season.""** Grimes actually looked like he was back to top tier form this season, and despite tearing his Achilles and being on the wrong side of 30, he looked even better this year than with the Dolphins in 2015. A great acquisition at a great price. 

**""On Marpet: ""Want a bold prediction here? Marpet will get All-Pro this year. Mark my words.""** All-Pro teams haven't been named yet, but from an NFC perspective, Marpet is going to have trouble getting named this season. Regardless, he took a huge step forward, and has arguably become the best lineman we have. He's nowhere near his ceiling yet. 
*The Ugly*
**""I’ve been a fan of this game long enough to see that poor behavior in college is usually a predictor of poor behavior in the NFL...Though Spence sent a month’s worth of clean drug tests to all 32 teams, I remain suspicious of his ability to stay clean.""** In reality, Spence has been a valuable asset to our team as a rookie, and he really came into his own later on in the season. Knock on wood, but he seems well removed from his checkered past and prior transgressions from college. He is going to be a valuable building block for our future. 

**On Chris Conte: ""When the Bucs signed Chris Conte last year, there was a collective rage amongst our fanbase. Conte proved us wrong and became one of the most reliable cogs in our otherwise porous secondary. I can’t imagine this was a large deal, but it’s an important one.""** Conte played solidly for us in 2015, but 2016 was a huge step back for him. His performance against the Raiders was one of the worst games I've ever seen from a safety, and he'll likely be gone in 2017. 

**On Kenny Bell: ""The hype machine around Kenny bell has been huge on r/Buccaneers, and with his return, we’re hoping he provides a speedy and sure handed target for Jameis. Projected Stats: 51 catches, 740 yards, 7 TDs. I dunno, this is probably a bullish and wildly off prediction. He may not even make the roster.""** Those projected stats? Quite off. Bell didn't make the final roster. 

**On Roberto Aguayo as a 2nd rounder: ""What he does bring us though, is almost absolute reliability with extra points, short to medium range field goals...""** Aguayo brought us none of that, and his lack of reliability made games more stressful than they should have been, at times. He will need to take a big step forward, starting with the preseason or risk losing his job to competition.

#Wrap-Up

If you’ve read my previous Buccaneer posts here, you’ll notice that they’re often full of self-deprecation, a reflection of the state our franchise has been in since our Super Bowl victory. The ineptitude of our past is no more. We have a capable and promising quarterback we’re prepared to lean on, an innovative coaching staff, and enough pieces on both sides of the ball that we will compete in 2017. 

Despite the pieces in place, I still consider this a developmental year and am not expecting a well-oiled machine that takes us deep into the playoffs—at least, not yet. As David Mamet said, ""Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance."" At the start of last season, the Buccaneers had one of the youngest rosters in football. The oldest? The Atlanta Falcons (who blew a 25-point lead in the Super Bowl, by the way). There’s something to be said about “old age and treachery” in this league, and the Buccaneers don’t have those grizzled veterans yet. In time, we will. 

What we lack in experience, we make up for in a locker room with more passion for football than we’ve had in a decade, as well as high energy guys who have helped shake our losing culture in the same way the John Lynches, Derrick Brooks types, and Ronde Barbers of the past did. 

Tune into Hard Knocks this year. You’re going to see the start of a very special couple of years for us. It’s about damn time.

1) (most likely) The 'it' refers to the Canadian rules they spoke of just prior which is no mention at all other than that they must be Canadian citizens and that they thus prefer this to a requirement of being born in a Country.

2) The 'it' refers to the Australian system of being solely an Australian citizen and they prefer this compared to the American system of being born in the country.

Both system they prefer instead of a requirement of being born in the country.  So asking why they think being born in Canada would be a good rule is misintepreting what they said.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e99ae52e9d884c9a96b00cbffa4ed500.png)  

&gt; Iced Earth is an American power metal band that combine heavy metal and speed metal/thrash metal genres in their music. The band was formed by Jon Schaffer, the lead songwriter and rhythm guitarist, in Tampa, Florida in 1984. The original name of the band was Purgatory but was then changed to Iced Earth.

&gt; Iced Earth’s music is often described as the style of Iron Maiden combined with 80’s thrash metal. The most distinctive element of the band’s sound is the stuttering right-hand gallop of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer, which sounds something like the ‘eighth-note, two-sixteenth-notes’ gallop made famous by Iron Maiden’s bass player/songwriter Steve Harris (in such songs as “Run to the Hills”, “The Trooper”, and “Caught Somewhere in Time”), varied rhythmically. Overtop of this gallop are typically laid strong melodic hooks, sometimes doubled by two guitars playing in harmony. The vocals are often high-pitched, but express a full range, while the rhythm section uses thrash and power metal techniques such as double-bass-drumming to keep the speed and energy high. Iced Earth’s drummer is known for his frequent use of drags and flams on the bass drum.

&gt; Today, Jon is the only original member in the band, having changed multiple guitarists, drummers, and vocalists. The two most recognized vocalists of the band are Matt Barlow and Tim Ripper Owens, the former vocalist of Judas Priest. Matt Barlow ended up marrying Jon's sister, making Matt the brother-in-law of Jon Schaffer.

&gt; Iced Earth lyrics tend to deal with theological issues such as punishment and sin, destiny, heaven and hell, the Antichrist and the apocalypse. Many of the band’s recent albums have been concept albums written around a theme, e.g. the antihero Spawn (The Dark Saga), horror movies (Horror Show), historical wars (The Glorious Burden) and the double concept about the anti-christ (Something Wicked).

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infertterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

At the pathway leading into the Obsidian Dragonshrine they found Wrathion, who was bemused by skeletons occupying the shrine even though the dragons had abandoned it for some years, musing that his father would never have approved. Chromie and the adventurer confronted Wrathion, thinking he may have known something, and Wrathion was ashamed that Chromie suspected him simply for being a black dragon. As Wrathion explained, he knew nothing about the attack and was simply visiting Northrend for ""[his] own amusement"", but was surprised to see a demonic infestation at the Obsidian Dragonshrine. He reminded Chromie and the adventurer that if they were looking for someone who might take umbrage at a dragon, they should start with the undead and whoever was controlling them. Chromie agreed that Wrathion made a fair point and the two of them left him to search inside the dragonshrine.",wow

And then he would be just another guy that can swing a mace kinda well. Because as a paladin Uther would lose any connection to the Light he has had after the purging due to regret and doubt. Now Arthas sees a city in ruin AND his mentor rendered powerless. If he had a wish for vengeance before now it would be cemented. If we assume that Uther helped with Stratholme we assume he would also follow Arthas to Northrend. There he would eventually end up **dead** just like Muradin and Arthas' story would proceed as planned.

4331,"It doesn't?

Didn't he get himself suspended for a game in 2015? Or what happened in the Vikings game last year when he had almost as many fouls called as catches?

I love what Beckham has brought to this team but lets not pretend for a second that it hasn't affected his play at all. And even if it hasn't, it's still a pain in the ass that the team doesn't want to deal with - they don't want to deal with the media questions and the circus that surrounds it. As he gets older, if this becomes a repeated pattern, teams are going to go after him from a mental standpoint. Beckham can't concede that mental edge.

I think a lot of the drama that surrounds him is blown out of proportion (eg not showing up for OTAs) but nevertheless, he needs to understand that he plays in a market where your life is going to get placed under a microscope regardless of what you do, and it only gets more intensified the better of a player you are. He doesn't need to be a choir boy like Eli or Jeter but he does need to just go meh whatever and let it go. He doesn't do that - custom cleats, tweets at the ""haters,"" and so on.

Bottom line, he can catch 10 balls for 120 yards and 2 TDs in a game, but if we're driving for a game winning field goal and he commits a stupid foul that pushes us out of FG range, that negates everything else he did in the game.

You're entitled to your opinion, but I feel like you watched a handful of shows, then wrote a handful of paragraphs loosely related to AOT in order to make your ""controversial"" opinion seem more grounded and researched, when the truth is that you have very little substance in there. 

You have a flawed premise to begin with, AOT and plenty of other anime are not about the fights. Even Naruto or One Piece are not, at their heart, about the fights. They're about following the plot and the characters to their final destination. Seeing if Naruto becomes hokage, seeing if Luffy will become Pirate King. The fights are just things that happen in the meanwhlie, that are exciting for the viewers. In AOT the basic plot is *will they survive?* And all of the titan fights, and battles and so on are just stepping stones on that journey. Of course, you could say that of course they will. It's a freaking anime. No, not even that it's an anime, it's a freaking *story,* so of course 99/100 the good guys will prevail in the very end. But that's true of anything. JJBA can be seen as boring in that light too, since of course JoJo will win in the end. But it's an enjoyable watch anyway to see how it happens and why it happens. Same in AOT. While you were hating on the lack of fights there, the characters were actually being developed, the world was being further fleshed out, and the show was trying its best to convey to you the same sense of hopelessness and dread that the characters are typically feeling. Which is not standard fare in anime, and one of the things that I always enjoyed most about AOT. 

As for the internet spoilers you read.... First, that's your own fault for reading spoilers to a show you may be continuing. 2, I don't know what sort of spoilers you've seen, but things happen further in the storyline that simply can't be predicted at this point in the story yet, things that are both genuinely surprising and also change so uch of the ultimate direction of the show. If these are boring twists to you, then you're simply objectively wrong, because I don't see how they could have been more exciting or significant. ",anime

4409,"&gt; The point is that as long as the matter hasn't gone through all the possible appeals, which could take decades for a civil suit of this magnitude

You began saying they were delaying *""until the paying party feels they can take the hit""*, now you have shortened to *""decades""*. This alone is a huge difference.

Still, this is not true. Assuming the appeal decision is coming soon, the only possible ""appeal"" is a ""cassazione"" judgment which, albeit long, won't take decades. The decision of first instance was published in october 2009, which means that the whole second instance appeal is taking less than 2 years. 

The third (and last) instance would probably take a little longer, I don't have precise data, but let's say about 3 years. It is not impossible (altough really improbable) that the court of cassazione sends the case back to the appeal court. That could take something like 2 more years.

So, they are probably delaying the payment 3-5 years. Let's even say that everything takes more time (appeal judgments tipically take more than 2 years), it will still take less than a ""decade"".

They play totally differently within their systems. If you have a Deep Cover 3 like Seattle does, Earls side to side ability is inherently more beneficial. But put him on, say, the Bears and you lose Earls playmaking because teams can just pick on the guys underneath him. 

Berry is more plug and play. He can fit into any system in the NFL and succeed. He's a jack of all trades but also a master of few. He's better at man coverage and in the box run defender. He could step onto 32 of 32 defenses and instantly make them better regardless of scheme. He's made Pro Bowls in different systems under different coaches. 

KC has let corners go each year because they know EB can make up for their failures. Seattle has, for the most part, kept a consistent core.

At a time when they should be gently preparing the audience for reality by prepping the audience to look forward to young players coming up from Grand Rapids to try to make their mark in the NHL and getting the audience hype about the team's commitment to drafting and developing, instead they actively kill hype for our prospects in things like that interview...

...and I'll never be over Holland's “Anthony Mantha was a spare part in the Calder Cup playoffs a year ago. Why does anyone think he is going to be the answer in Detroit?”

Instead of playing his cards with savvy he's been actively derailing interest in and excitement for the team's prospects at every turn.

The thing is, most of them sound good on their face, but lack roots in reality. I mean the simple fact that it starts off with, ""All suggestions should be fair"" tells you a lot about the mindset here.

If you believe it is possible to create a system that is fair to everyone, we have a fundamental disagreement. I don't think that particular society is possible without a shit load of culling.

That belief is actually what brings me here. I don't believe the ends justifies the means. Ever. 

I wholeheartedly believe that if Hitler had succeeded, there would have been a peaceful, fair society for those who weren't slaughtered.

I believe if the NWO/TPTB/Illuminati were able to succeed in their plans, those that would be left would consider themselves in a fair, just, peaceful society as well.

It's not the result I have a problem with, so much as the means of getting there. 

We really need to start accepting that equality of opportunity and equality of Rights are not equal to equality of outcome. Things will always be unfair to an extent, unless you remove most of what makes us human in the first place.

All you have to do is make sure everyone thinks and looks exactly the same, while all having the same social standing, earning the same amount of everything, and contributing the same amount of everything. Otherwise you need absolute mind control.

I'm not a fan of those outcomes. Like I said before, I'll take this point by point when I have time. This is a rough overview of my thoughts while the thread is still alive lol",conspiracy

Once you accept your SR is meaningless, and that all the ranking is essentially meaningless, you can start to actually have fun with it.  The truth is, because Overwatch is a team game, the SR will never be truly accurate; you could theoretically be in Bronze just because of pure bad luck (although I will concede it's pretty unlikely).  

I haven't even gotten into the throwers, the griefers, and all the other problematic players currently infesting Overwatch Competitive.  

I won't pretend to have solutions, but Overwatch Competitive is just flat out not worth it right now, especially for someone like me who thinks gold weapons look garish.

Stalin was a complete bastard and almost as bad as hitler. But i have to face that before him, it was even worse of a shithole. Let alone hitler's plan to genocide all of eastern europe.

So i'll stand by my idea that the *post stalin* era, the one without all the massacres, in the USSR was a noticable improvement.

I loved when Rin's past self shone through when Nitori called himself a lost cause. Rin's such a huge believer of working hard for what you love, which makes him a great leader.

And here's where you're wrong. Everything was agreed upon when Turkey signed the treaty. Articles 12, 15 and 16 of the treaty are pretty clear. The islands situated at less than three miles from the Asiatic coast remain under Turkish sovereignty and Turkey renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the treaty. Imbros and Tenedos are exceptions to this. All other islands don't have to be specified or named. It's simple. Turkey keeps everything that's within 3 nm of the coast, except for some named islands like Samos which it also gave away to Italy.

The same goes for honor (the old system). With 4 you could get 3x honor every game and after 7-10 games you would get the banner... even though they say multiple honors from the same people mean less/honor means more from someone who doesn't do it.

&gt; Era Istrefi (born 4 July 1995), sometimes known as simply Era (stylized as ERA), is an Albanian Kosovar singer and songwriter. She rose to fame after releasing her debut single ""Mani për money"" in 2013, which gained a positive feedback and attention from the public. Her following songs ""A po don"" and ""E dehun"", gained the same success. In June 2014, she won three Videofest awards for her music videos, including ""Best New Artist"" for her work in 2013.

&gt; In 2015 Era gained success with her song ""Njo si ti"" with over a million views on YouTube in a week. Her first duo featuring well-known Kosovo rapper Ledri Vula, ""Shumë pis"", became a summer hit.

&gt; In January 2016, Istrefi began achieving international attention due to the release of her single ""BonBon"", which drew comparisons to the work of Sia and Rihanna. Following the single's success, she was signed to American record labels Sony Music Entertainment, RCA Records, and Ultra Music in February 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

4775,"UBI isn't just because of automation. Part of it is the idea that you get rid of a ton of separate welfare programs (tax deduction here, credit there, reduced bill for this and that, a cheque being mailed for this, a different one for that, etc) and just institute 1 simple program that gives everyone some simple-to-calculate sum of money to spend as they like.

Supposedly the simplified administrative burden would reduce costs, and the other benefit is that often people know what they need better than the government. IE maybe some people who qualify for food stamps but not for electricity assistance would be better off the other way around because they grow their own food but their electricity bill is absurd. UBI just gives them the money and lets them decide.

Of course that means some people will spend food-stamp money on drugs instead but the thinking is they might not if they had enough money to really feel like they can turn their life around and didn't feel discouraged.

Obviously the above is up for debate, but it's part of the justification for UBI, alongside the idea that automation will inevitably reduce the number of jobs available (which is also up for debate, so far automation has created new jobs while making some obsolete).

So if the point is to just reduce the administrative costs and to give money instead of food-stamps or bill reductions, then tying the way you get money back into taxes accomplishes those goals as long as we make the tax code behave like a UBI (ie you always get X amount of money back regardless of your income).",conspiracy

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

*The Red Sox and Astros still don't make up.

*The Mariners might be out of the AL!

*The players demand a union and subsequently ask that no one talk about unions after the thread was spammed relentlessly.

*The Red Sox and Astros still haven't made up.

*The AL and NL refuse to trade during the ASG.

&gt; There seem to be at least 9 bands with this name:

&gt; 1) Japanese Heavy Metal band. One of the members, Heath, is the current bass player of X JAPAN (since 1993).

&gt; 2)ParAnOia hailed from Stoke-On-Trent in Staffordshire, UK during the 1980's. Thanks to the internet there has been an upsurge in interest in the band over recent years. The band came out of obscurity in 1983 with their first releases on Rot Records; a 7"" vinyl single entitled 'Dead Mans Dreams' and then an album 'Shattered Glass', which received rave reviews in the music press. The tracks on this page, most of which are live studio recordings are free to download, are and are all previously unreleased and unheard. Although the band decided to 'call it a day' in the latter part of the '80s and no longer perform together, the band members are still very close.

&gt; 3) Lesser known Basque Rock band, one member later formed Keike

&gt; 4) East-German Punk band formed 1983 in Dresden in the former German Democratic Republic. Officially Punk never exist in GDR but there was an active scene with a lot groups in underground. Paranoia was demoralised by Secred Security Service in GDR and splitup later, parts of the members form Kaltfront. In 2007 there was a reunion for a few concerts.

&gt; 5) Polish Grindcore Band

&gt; 6) A thrash metal band from California, U.S.A.

&gt; 7) Metal band from Switzerland, first and only record 'Resonant Outbreak' was released in 2006.

&gt; 8) An international drum &amp; bass trio that includes UK producer J Mogs: http://www.youtube.com/paranoiarecordz 

&gt; 9) Maine-based songwriter Jakob Battick recorded an early four track demo under the name Paranoia in 2007 around the time that 1800s Sea Monster was breaking up before going on to do his Swollen Spring Violets and Mt. Moon projects.  He now records and plays under his own name or as Jakob Battick &amp; Friends.

&gt; 10) An Australian grunge band, formed in 2007 and disbanded in 2009.

&gt; 11) Hungarian punk/melodycore band.

&gt; 12) Norwegian hardcore punk band.

&gt; 13) German Oi/Streetpunk band from Brandenburg. Read more on Last.fm.

5057,"&gt;In 2007 the sentiment was that the failures in Iraq were because we'd bit off more than we could chew and not that we illegal invaded and destroyed the nation for selfish interests.

Those aren't mutually exclusive reasons. And the notion that we had invaded for selfish reasons was hardly unpopular by 2007 in the U.S. media. Only conservative outlets were keeping up the charade.

&gt; The media's treatment of the occupation is that it was 'untenable', which is the fucking problem since the treatment should have focused on what American GIs were doing to the local populace. 

If you think that those things weren't well-covered you were living under a rock. It was practically common knowledge by 2007 that the troops were generally not welcomed and far too many civilians were being killed.

&gt;. And now you still continue this idiotic line of thought that Iraqis can't govern themselves, using the evidence that the nation fragmented from instability and divisivness caused by the U.S invasion.

The U.S. invasion did not cause the Sunni/Shia split. It ""put the Shiites in charge"" only to the extent that we held elections and the vast majority of Iraqis are Shiite and voted for Shiite representation. That was democracy. And the subsequence Shiite government treated the Sunnis terribly. So yes, they were largely unable to effectively govern themselves at the time and did not seem to value consensus building or religious reconciliation. The U.S. invasion didn't cause any of that. The democratically elected Iraqi government did.

The U.S. fucked up. You can pretend all you want that I'm defending the U.S.' actions but that wont' be true. 

However that doesn't give the Iraqis a pass at all for being unable to resolve their infighting when given the opportunity to. 

Dissolving the military was only an ISIS-creating bad idea if the subsequent government can't govern effectively and ends up alienating Sunnis. Well, that happened. ",worldnews

dont mute everyone at the beginning of the game.

instead-

communicate with your team. its a TEAM GAME. go play diablo if you dont enjoy playing with others.
When someone is being toxic just mute him it takes exactly 1 second to do so.
i know that sometimes there are games where all of your team and the enemies are being unfriendly and there you can and should mute all. but thats maybe 1 out of 30 of games. 
muting everyone at the start is 100% the wrong attitude.

As for the handful of strikes balled, without watching the video I can't say but MLB, not even MLB Umpires but MLB encourages umpires to manage the game, one of their tools for doing so is balling strikes that catcher fucking murder.

5155,"I know a lot of fans have shit on Carroll for what he said, and he's definitely not worth his contract, however, he is right. I think it's hard to play in an ISO-oriented offense. Think of it from a role player perspective. The ball doesn't move around at all, and when it does get to you, you're expected to shoot and make every shot. When you miss, it stands out a lot more vs. being in a ball-moving offense. It's really hard for the role players to get into any type of rhythm. Doesn't excuse Carroll for being terrible because he's an NBA vet, but I think it's difficult to play ISO ball.

5156,"Sakura opinion is not unpopular at all, not even within the fanbase of the series. It's kind of a shame - She was horrendous at first but during the first few arcs of part 2 she was actually kind of cool, but eventually it became abundantly clear that as long as she kept being Sauce-cake's bitch she was getting absolutely nowhere. I don't think I've EVER seen a character with a feature as damaging to their own development as Sakura's obsession with him - If she got over him, she'd most likely have a much different, and probably far superior development. Basically all women in Naruto spin around on some guy, but hell at least Hinata (More or less the only female character with genuine development, besides maybe Tsunade and to a lesser extent Ino) used her love for Naruto positively, she could achieve her goals and overcome her self-esteem issues to the point of even slapping sense into Naruto (Which she would've never managed to do earlier in the series). Sakura's obsession with Sasuke is a complete road block for her since she can't even raise her voice against him, she's a scardy little kitten as soon as he shows up. But eh, the character development in part 2 is easily one of its worse features, so who knows if it would've been much better.

As for Yoko, meh she's a pretty fun character. She's not essential to the story but she contributes a few different emotional angles that others characters couldn't contribute, so she's useful to the narrative in that sense.",anime

It makes for kind of an interesting question: if plugging into the Matrix is a far superior individual experience than unplugging (i.e., living life in the Matrix, the way it's presented, vs. living in the dingy, dreary real world with its food-paste, for example), is it really a bad thing to prefer to stay in the Matrix?

The movie comes down *hard* on the answer of ""Yes, yes it is.  The real world is always preferable to what the Matrix offered.""  But it was also told from the point of view of fanatics (I don't mean that in a negative way; just that they're true-believers in their answer).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9cc50f697bcc4737919865392afd4a09.png)  

&gt; David Jon Gilmour, known as David Gilmour (born 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, who was the guitarist, lead vocalist and one of the songwriters of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd.

&gt; Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who raised her family at Grantchester Meadows, later immortalised by a Roger Waters song on Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Gilmour and his siblings were encouraged by their parents in their musical abilities. Gilmour has a younger brother, Peter, who has been a guitarist for a slightly longer time than Gilmour. Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he ""didn't enjoy"" but where he met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett, along with bassist and vocalist Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1954, Gilmour bought his first single, Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"". At age 13, Gilmour was given his first guitar, a Tatay, by his neighbour, Gilmour started learning how to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.

&gt; In September 1962, he studied modern languages to A-Level and, along with Syd Barrett, went to Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the languages course, Gilmour would eventually become a fluent French speaker. Gilmour and Barrett spent their lunchtime practising guitar together, Barrett would often refer to Gilmour as ""Fred"". They were not yet bandmates, however, and Gilmour started playing in the band Jokers Wild in 1962, which Gilmour left in 1967.

&gt; Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former front man and guitarist Syd Barrett.  Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (due to his deteriorating mental state), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the ""Pink Floyd"" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""(Itself about Syd), ""Wish You Were Here"" (about Roger's father) , ""Time"", ""Dogs"", ""Echoes"", ""Comfortably Numb"", and ""Run Like Hell"".  When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994).  Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member.  On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8.  The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof.  Rumours of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be.  Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiasm to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.

&gt; Much to everyone's surprise, Gilmour and Waters reunited once again on July 11, 2010 for a charity performance for ""The Hoping Foundation,"" an organization that supports Palestinian refugee kids.  At Ronnie Scott's club in London, the duo performed four songs together: ""To Know Him is to Love Him"" (a cover of the old Teddy Bear's song), ""Wish You Were Here,"" ""Comfortably Numb,"" and finally (after a special request) ""Another Brick in the Wall Part 2.""  Once again, just like after the Live 8 Reunion, speculation began regarding future reunions.  No official Pink Floyd reunion has yet been set, but Gilmour did promise that he would join Roger Waters for one show on his 2010-11 ""The Wall"" tour, performing ""Comfortably Numb.""  The show that Gilmour is set to play is being kept a secret to surprise fans and (most likely) to prevent scalpers from selling tickets at outrageous prices.

&gt; The door now seems slightly ajar that David Gilmour and Roger Waters may possibly work with each other again, either as a duo, or as Pink Floyd once again.  On Roger Waters facebook page, he wrote: ""We (played together), and it was fucking great!  End of story.  Or possibly beginning.""

&gt; As a solo artist, David Gilmour has released 3 studio albums; David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On an Island (2006). In September 2008, he released his first live album Live In Gdansk , a recording of a concert he and his band performed in Gdansk Shipyard during his 2006 On An Island tour. In addition, he has two live DVDs - 2002's mostly acoustic ""In Concert"" and 2007's Remember That Night.  Read more on Last.fm.

5414,"&gt;It's as though whoever came out with 'the sun' explanation doesn't realise that we are intelligent enough to know that there is a reason why the heat of the sun is affecting the planet more. 'It's just the tilt of the Earth facing closer to the sun.' What, like what happens every year? lol

**Seriously!** I wonder what the overlap is with flat earthers, given the lack of basic scientific literacy.

Like, really? They think climate scientists aren't already thinking about the Sun, the single largest energy input to the climate system? 

&gt;The Earth, animals and humans win if we use a cleaner, safer and renewable fuel source while the fossil fuel industry continues to win by upping their fuel costs if we stay on fossil fuels. It is that simple.

Not to mention people seem to forget that fossil fuels are, by nature, limited. They're produced at a rate that, globally speaking, is vastly outpaced by our consumption.

5543,"Something to go along with the ""law of large numbers"" point.  Every game you have 9 ""random"" players and yourself, so think of it like this;

Each player is has a skill level between 1 and 10.  

Each individual player has a set number

Every game has 10 random [numbers] players and the team with the higher number wins.

If you are in the game then you have 4 random numbers on your team and 5 on the other, so if your ""skill number"" is 6 or above you are more likely to win

Obviously if rng isnt on your side its possible to be a 10 and get four 1's on your side while the other team gets five 8's [14&lt;40], but as OP stated, in the long run, if you truly are better than the competition it will even out.

Don't put emphasis on the short term wins and loses, just improve every game.  If I lose a game but I learned from it and improved from a 5 to a 6, then I just went from ""more likely to lose"" to ""more likely to win"".

&gt;I know this is a very old thing for most people, but I think that the Hero Limit should be removed from QP or at least set to 2 or 3. Currently people are treating QP as competitive that doesn't actually give you SR or CP. When people are saying this game is dying, its because when you leave comp to play QP you are stuck with comp again. I remember when quick play was fun, you could go with teams of 6 hanzo's or like 3 lucio's and 3 symmetra's. It was always very fun, but ever since blizzcon 2016 it felt like a less competitive competitive. I wont really think that the hero limit should be totally removed but maybe like 2 or 3 hero limit. Make it so we can still have super crazy comps and such. The 1 hero limit in competitive is good. But quick play should get its old no hero limit back. I liked it in the arcade but when people play the arcade most go towards gamemodes like total mayhem or ctf and such. No limits did not seem very popular. But it was very fun. I played so many games with the craziest and weirdest comps. They were amazing and worked well. All of this stuff most of the player base wont remember. It seems like most people are newish, by meaning after blizzcon. I do have to say those people are missing out by not have playing it. Especially with the new hero, Doomfist, there wont be that rush to choose him. It will just be select who you want. Could there at least be something like how we had the pages like when you had the old pve events like junkenstiens revenge or uprising where you could select a difficulty, could there be a page like that where you can select a 1 hero limit or a no hero limit. It wouldn't really split the player base anymore because those people selecting no hero limit would have probably gone to the arcade, but being able to select it in a easier position would make it played more and more fun. Just like the custom game browser being moved to a easier to see place, it is being more popular. The same should happen with no limits or old qp. This probably is the least popular opinion in Overwatch, but I think it should be tested or at least thought about, the community needs somewhere where team comp doesn't really matter and you can just relax and play. Aracde is kinda used for that but not very much. Custom games COULD be used for this but I don't have 11 friends that want to do it and nobody really joins custom games like that. But I hope someone from blizzard looks at this and hopefully at least thinks about it. Love your game. &lt;3

The essential difference was that redditred said the ""worst tourists in the world"" were Germans, and presented this as some sort of *fact*.

Had they picked 14th, the Jazz had high expectations for an international player from Greece named Giannis Antetokounmpo*, who ended up being picked 15th by the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Jazz also picked a Center from France with the 27th pick that year, named Rudy Gobert.

SUNSPOT RESURRECTED: Old and decaying sunspot 1035, declared to be ""a corpse"" just yesterday, is showing signs of renewed life. Pete Lawrence sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Selsey, UK:
1/09/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=09&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 SOLAR ACTIVITY: Today has brought an uptick in solar activity. Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is crackling with minor solar flares and seems to be gathering itself for something more. Just hours ago, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory captured this C1-class eruption:
￼
Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
a movie: ""The plasma crawling around inside AR1040 made me think of the head of Medusa. It was exciting to watch!"" says amateur astronomer Michael Buxton of Ocean Beach, California. ""I made this time-lapse movie at 1 minute intervals from 2045-2215 UT on 8 Jan. 2010.""
￼
""A welcome view of the sun on a cold January day reveals the remains of AR11035 still alive and kicking,"" says Lawrence.
Beneath the waving filaments and bright magnetic froth (""plage""), a dark core is coelescing in the heart of the active region. That makes it a genuine sunspot again. NOAA has re-numbered the region ""1040,"" but we will continue to refer to it by its original name, ""1035."" It is, after all, an old friend.
1/10/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=10&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is growing again and is now at least four times wider than planet Earth. A blink comparison of SOHO images shows how the sunspot has expanded in the past 24 hours:
￼
Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
1/11/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=11&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is busy growing again. In only 24 hours, it has expanded from a barely visible ""sun-speck"" to a planet-sized active region with 15 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Steve Riegel sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Santa Maria, California:
￼
""On Sunday, the clouds opened up for some fantastic viewing,"" says Riegel. ""I photographed the active region using a Lunt 60 solar telescope.""
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24. Its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters estimate a 10% chance of M- class solar flares during the next 24 hours. Stay tuned.
1/12/2012 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=12&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010
ACTIVE SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is still growing. During the past two days it has doubled in size--and then doubled again--to produce an active region with more than 25 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Dennis Simmons sends this picture of the behemoth from Brisbane, Australia:
￼
""Sweltering under the Australian sun at over 31o C, I had to wipe the perspiration from my eyes while attempting to obtain sharp focus through Earth's shimmering atmosphere,"" says Simmons. ""It didn’t help that I had my head under a blanket to block out the bright sunlight that was washing out the display on my Notebook computer! In the end, technology and software allowed me to obtain some reasonable results. It is an impressive sunspot.""
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24, and its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters say there is a 15% chance of an isolated M-class solar flare during the next 24 hours. Readers with solar telescopes should be alert for eruptions.
Solar winds began at a low 291km/s on the 08th. From beginning minima calm. New sunspot introduced to lens emitting gamma / beta M class activity. Most active the 09th. Average time to eartg 1-3 days.
Could likely have lead to a sizeable quake. (imo). Wind speeds doubled by the 11th. At 490km/s.
Unaware of coronal holes via solarham archive. Although this ch was spotted on the 01st of January 2010
Which was likely geoactive on the 10th. Being the sunspot was behind the CH. Which likely lead to increased geo magnetic storm levels. Prior to the forthcoming Sunspot.
So both coronal holes and sunspots were geo active on tge lens. My guess is this was at the very beginning of cycle 24. Post minima. Which increased the general threat from solar upticks.

5867,"I'm from the capital and study in Ghent, the second largest city in Flanders. In Brussels, there is absolutely no willingness to split up. Frankly, most of the people there (french as well as dutch speaking) would loathe the idea, because the Flemish separatists like to claim the capital as their own although less than 20% of the people here speak dutch. I think the same sentiments are felt in Wallonia.

I don't think I really understand the mood in Flanders, so I can't speak to that part. But I don't think there is a lot of support for actual independence, more for larger separation of government. You could compare it to the US where some people want more power shifted to the states.

I've been afraid for some time now that the strategy for the Flemish separatists has been to stretch out the negotiations and pointing the finger at the frenchspeaking politicians for not giving in for so long that they can somehow get to independence that way. Bart De Wever, the leader of the separatists, actually said something like ""We are willing to negotiate, but not when that means we have to give in on anything"". 

There has yet to be any sort of real outcry from the people for anything. They're were one or two demonstrations, but they didn't have a solid message, more like ""let's just make a government, you guys"". It's all kind of depressing and a lot of youths won't care as long as it's not really affecting them. I've been hoping for a long time that a student movement would stand up and take real action, but nothing of consequence has been done by anyone.

Personally, I think the idea of separatism in any form in a united Europe is retarded and every economic reasoning behind it is a very devious form of latent racism. Besides that, the separatist's economic policies are nothing short of insane.

I consider myself a millienial and I was born in 93, so I'm in my early twenties now, meaning the period defining pop-music artists ""for me"" are has-beens now - people like Eminem, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Coldplay and so on. Generally music history is treated in decades because it allows for more precise boundaries when performing comparisons of the evolutionary lines of music. I've listened to music for three decades, and they were all very different from one another, even though I belong to one generation.

As for defining artist, as in creators and/or cultural symbols of a specific subculture, I dont really see that happening in the same way that it did with earlier generations. Music seems to follow the subcultures nowadays, rather than the other way around, as it used to be. I think our current period in music history will be largely remembered by musicologist as the period where elements of electronic music finally blended with traditional instrumentation and the divide between computer generated sounds and ""real music"" is eliminated, but it's impossible to say for sure. 

Ultimately, I think the period defining artist are determined by what direction the evolution of music goes - the artists that were the inspiriation for the next musical paradigm will be the ones written about in the history. All generations have myriads of celebrities and successful artist you never heard of because they weren't significant enough to earn a place in music history.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c6c20ba1531b4f39bdf29c2ffea35ede.png)  

&gt; Boston is a rock band that formed in 1974 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Centered on guitarist, songwriter, and producer Tom Scholz, a former product designer at Polaroid Corporation and an MIT engineering student, the band's best known works include the popular singles ""More Than a Feeling"", ""Peace of Mind"", ""Foreplay/Long Time"", ""Don't Look Back"", and ""Amanda"" among others. Their 1976 self-titled debut is the second biggest-selling debut album of all-time in the U.S., with more than 17 million copies sold. 'Third Stage' was only the second album to ever be certified triple-platinum in its first month of release, in November of 1986. The first was Lionel Richie's 'Dancing On The Ceiling', which did it one month earlier.

&gt; The group first formed in the mind of Tom Scholz, who had long expressed interest in melodic rock and the fine particulars of recording technology. Even as a child, he tinkered with just about anything mechanical or electronic that he could get his hands on. Prior to his musical career, Scholz received both a bachelor's degree, in 1969, and a master's degree, in 1970, in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then began working for the Polaroid Corporation as a senior product design engineer. Scholz would then reside in Boston.

&gt; Creating demos in his own home, inspired by contemporary 70s progressive rock and what came to be known as ""album oriented rock"" (""aor""), Scholz attracted the interest of Epic Records, who signed Scholz to a recording contract. Vocalist Brad Delp, who was born in Peabody, Massachusetts in 1951 (Scholz is about four years older) to French-Canadian immigrants and was inspired to sing after seeing The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, served as a sort of not-so secret weapon for Scholz's project. Delp's ""golden voice"" has inspired numerous later rock artists to take up the microphone.

&gt; Scholz believed that his demos were good enough to be the released album but Epic told him to rerecord them. Most of the guitar, bass, and keyboards were performed by Scholz, although other players were involved sporadically throughout the recording of the album. Epic did not want the album recorded entirely in Scholz's home as Scholz intended (they suggested using a recording studio), but most of what ended up on the album was ultimately recorded by Scholz in his basement.

&gt; 'Boston' was first released by Epic Records on August 25, 1976. Few industry insiders thought a guitar-heavy rock record could make much of a dent in the charts as disco ruled the airwaves at the time. The album broke out of Cleveland first, and the following week it had been added at 392 stations. Scholz, then 29, still worked at Polaroid during the first few weeks of the record's success and felt wary, changing his mind when the album quickly sold 200,000 copies. Critical praise also came to the band; for example, Rolling Stone wrote that Boston's ""affinity for heavy rock &amp; roll provides a sense of dynamics that coheres magnetically with sophisticated progressive structures.""

&gt; The album was certified gold just two months after its release, and it sold another 500,000 copies within 30 days, going platinum for the first time in November 1976. With songs that became rock anthems such as the evergreen ""More Than a Feeling"", 'Boston' is the second best-selling debut album of all time in the United States, falling just short of Guns N' Roses' 'Appetite for Destruction'. Many critics have named it as one of the best American albums of all time.

&gt; With a touring unit coming together around the line-up of Barry Goudreau, Tom Scholz, Sib Hashian, Brad Delp, and Fran Sheehan, the band played to a wide variety of crowds big and small, receiving strong fan support. Feeling an essentially unbearable amount of pressure to come up with another commercial mega-hit, Scholz's still desired to experiment with his sound and had a growing sense of perfectionism. 'Don't Look Back' came out on August 2, 1978, viewed by Scholz as a hurried effort but picking up widespread success. It's been certified as multi-platinum, and its title track has become a classic rock staple.

&gt; Acrimonious fighting with label Epic Records, which soon became a long, drawn-out legal fight, left the future of the band stalled. Their next work, 'Third Stage' , came out in September 23, 1986, quite a while after their sophomore work. Bad luck and ill-will seemed to trail the group, with floods and power failures halting many studio sessions. Still, the album went to #1 on the Billboard 200, where it stayed for four weeks.

&gt; In addition, 'Third Stage' was only the second album to ever be certified triple-platinum in its first month of release, in November of 1986. As stated before, the first was Lionel Richie's 'Dancing On The Ceiling', which did it one month earlier. Nonetheless, Boston seemed to have gotten stuck.

&gt; On March 9th, 2007, Brad Delp (vocals) committed suicide at his home in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  He was 55. Delp sang all the lead and harmony vocals on Boston's first three albums. Though well known for his ""golden"" voice with soaring vocals and range, Delp was also a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, harmonica and keyboards. Additionally he wrote or co-wrote several songs for Boston and many other artists.  He has since been replaced with a singer from Asia who Tom Scholz's wife heard singing Boston songs and couldn't believe it wasn't actually Brad singing.

&gt; More than 10 years in the making, Boston will be coming out with a new studio album, ""Life, Love &amp; Hope"" on December 3, 2013. Founding member, Tom Scholz states, ""These are songs from the heart, each of them taking many months of effort to write, arrange, perform and record, always up to the demands of Boston's harshest critic, me. They have all been meticulously recorded to analogue tape on the same machines and equipment used for Boston's hits for the past 35 years."" 

&gt; The album will include lead vocals from Brad Delp, Tommy DeCarlo, Kimberley Dahme, David Victor, and Tom Scholz, and features tracks with the classic Boston sound, as well as the latest in the evolution of Scholz' musical artistry. ""I intentionally stayed close to the early BOSTON style on some of the songs, even using the same amps and instruments; on others I let my imagination run wild,"" says Tom.

Let's say I get a pedicure. The lady who does my pedicure does an amazing job, great massage, meticulous paint job, just fine work. I'm for sure throwing down 20% in cash. She's done a good job and I want her to know. She deserves extra money on top of what I am paying for the service. If I get a half ass job done by someone who doesn't give two shits then why in the world would I give extra $$?

Same goes for food service. I don't have a complicated order but if you ask for how I want my burger/meat and I say medium then I'd like it medium. Don't come back with a well cooked piece of meat. It's your job to make sure it's taken care of. If you handle all that then yeah it's taking care of things and that's what earns a 20% tip. 

But if you just take an order and then someone  else brings the food and I don't see you again till I get a bill...tell me what exactly was done to earn extra $$$? I'm paying for the food, and I'll even tip 10-12% but I won't toss down 20%

And every time I get servers yelling at me about how it's expected and I NEED to tip I feel like I'm less inclined to do so, that gut instinct  to round up goes away. 

No one tips me. They pay for their service and that's that. Most industry works that way. ",funny

6267,"As someone that burned out pretty hard in Legion and am pretty much just watching the WoW subreddit for 7.3 news/8.0 speculation (where I will undoubtedly return for 8.0 and POSSIBLY just to lore out on 7.3), it's definitely not my best xpac of all time.

I'd actually rank it as follows:
Wrath &gt; BC &gt; MoP &gt; Legion &gt; Cata &gt; WoD.

I have a LOT of complaints about Legion -- faux content (7.2, anyone?), raid tuning/quality (Nighthold got stale really fast after the lukewarmness that was Emerald Nightmare), difficulty of alts, over-reliance on RNG to artificially lengthen content, the mid expansion class reworks/radical balance tuning, the gutting of the classes/bland gameplay. 

Legion was ALMOST a great expansion for me, but especially after (and not to shamelessly plug another game) playing another particular MMO's latest expac, Legion just doesn't compare. The writing is better, encounter design (so far) is better, class changes are better, PvP is even better. It's frustrating because Legion has WildStar syndrome for me -- it was 93% a great expansion pack but the 7% that was bad was so relentlessly bad, so unyieldingly it just killed all interest in playing for now.

That being said, I've been playing WoW since 2004, I am sure I will be playing again in 2018, and there's still a decent chance I wind up resubbing just to do the lore content (and LFR) on Argus before I AFK until 8.0. ",wow

&gt;**TL;DR: **We’ve been working on some improvements to the broadcast HUD to make esports matches clearer and easier to watch. Still a work in progress, but we wanted to share some of our early thoughts with you on what an updated HUD could look like and get your feedback. Read on for some more details and a progress video to learn more.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current spectator HUD was released more than four years ago when League of  
&gt;Legends esports was still in its infancy. We think we can improve on the  
&gt;original design and make it easier and more fun for you to follow matches with  
&gt;all the information you need.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've created a new HUD specifically with esports broadcasts in mind that  
&gt;we’re starting to share with players for feedback and wanted to share with you  
&gt;a sneak peek at our progress so far. We had two major goals when we started  
&gt;investigating new designs:  
&gt;  
&gt;  * **Get rid of the clutter and optimize for viewing the action. **The current HUD takes up a lot of space on the screen, and often covers up important gameplay. To try to solve this, we’ve rethought the layout and have cut down and consolidated the elements on the screen.  
&gt;  * **Enable you to more quickly and easily understand the state of the game. **At the moment, it’s not always easy to follow stats and info during a pro match. We’ve taken a pass at everything from readability of ult cooldowns to easier comparisons between lane match-ups.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here’s a video that shows some of our work so far to create a cleaner and  
&gt;clearer viewing experience. We’re still polishing many of the features and  
&gt;incorporating elements you’re used to seeing on the broadcast, but it’s a good  
&gt;early guide to the evolving design.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re continuing to test the new HUD out and gathering feedback, and will  
&gt;follow up with more information on when you can expect to see this debut. In  
&gt;the meantime, please comment on how you watch and what you like and dislike  
&gt;about both the current spectator HUD and the new HUD.

6456,"Not in the same manner as Trump and especially Putin. Erdoğan presents himself as a ""leader"", not as ""macho"". It's quite different, and by no means mutually exclusive. Putin and Trump also present themselves as leaders, especially Putin. No, by ""macho"", I think we mean is that Erdoğan doesn't try to show himself as a ""man"" excessively, as in, masculinity.

Putin, on the other hand, has photoshoots involving him riding bare-chested. Hunting and pacifying a tiger - yes, I know that was staged, but the message remains the same. The examples are many, but the message is clear: ""I am a man, not a woman"".

Trump's is less ""in-your-face"" than Putin, perhaps due to how American politics go. It's mixed in with misogyny, I'd say, with his belittling comments about women, most notably the infamous ""grab them by the p..."" comment he had made in the mid-2000's. Again, he projects a ""this is how manly men do things"" image with the misogynistic commentary.

Erdoğan, on the other hand, doesn't cultivate the ""manly man"" image. You don't see him hunting, posing bare-chested, or talking about how one should handle female genitalia. It's mostly because he's in Turkey, where the latter topic is an absolute taboo to talk about, and would *not* help his ratings in the slightest. The middle one, well...he's not all that attractive, really, aside from being tall. We've seen him half-naked, when he went to a pilgrimage, and he looks like an average 60 year-old: Pale, flabby skin on a flabby face. Not like Putin, who can at least afford to be bare-chested. As for the rampant misogyny, as you said, a lot of his support comes from the women. While he and his underlings often have intolerable levels of misogynistic comments, he can't afford to take them *too* far just to cultivate a ""masculine"" image he doesn't even need, for he might alienate too many female voters for very little gain.",europe

6505,"tradition which itself is inconveniencing. If you categorize religion or the delusions as an inconvenience, I highly suggest that you re-evaluate the damages, setbacks and wars that these things cause. I don't point out Christianity in general. All religions are a problem and prevent us from moving on. While we do see Unitarian Universalism and ""humanist"" religions manage to become solid organizations from time to time, that's more tolerance than anything. Like I said, you can't argue someone's religious beliefs. To be more clear, you can't counter everything that someone identifies with, at least not at once.

As for the ""a group of volunteer US federal employees"" you mentioned, I don't discriminate career or occupation when in my definition of ""hippy"". I guess it would've been better served with something more concretely demeaning? Pseudo-intellectual hipsters following the Voices in popular culture? That sounds better at least and it less metaphoric anyway. 

My point on money and effort is highlighted by the fact that the movement you mention is volunteer-based. As a collective (hive), the United States really does stand indivisible. Exceptions aren't made, large sweeping changes aren't adopted. The maxim ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" sums up the philosophy adopted by many. In other words, if it works, even half-ass ""and we can't afford to change it now"" we're not overhauling it.

The context in which I mentioned tradition. Have you given much thought to the dynasties of thought or mindset that get passed down to people? Thought constructs, ideas, code (written or unwritten), meme system; whichever word you identify with more. They're passed down through the generations. Approximately 10 generations ago (and in some cases less) we were living with British folk on our continent, a part of Britain (don't correct me if I'm wrong), wearing white wigs and then soon after our legal and political systems started to be created. Over the years, these things have been re-adopted and unchanged. Your use of PLAIN to illustrate that real, educated people want change is fine. I agree. The same can be said of MENSA, though there's some debate over the hard facts of what the founders had in mind. This search: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=mensa+advise+government gives a good idea of a resource, like PLAIN that is going to waste because of tradition and the idea/meme that the US as a whole has a destiny, which in some way is linked to the divine and it's as it should be. One of the hardest things for me to come to grips with is the stoic, focused manner in which our elected officials that are not in touch with the level of information today and the  amount of information which has been proven false or newly found. Part of this comes from having little interest or being unable to use computers. The attitudes that go along with being old, out of date, Christian (and in many cases believing that God put you where you are, take Rick Perry, doing his religious service as a Governor here in Texas where I live, he's just vocal about it, many other elected officials have been quoted saying similar things). 

Religious folks or not, especially those in generations prior to those born in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s - tend to avoid the details and facts when it comes to what they use in the world. I'm sorry, it's not just the fundamentalists who take the bible seriously or don't care anymore, that's an argument made by many. It's a sign of the times when people associate themselves with a church or ministry that's doing good to be part of doing good, yet lack the most basic education about God. It's not a failure in teaching or a failure in learning. Most of the people born sub-1950 had shitty educations. We still even now have shitty educations, much less the theological teachings that are pro-Christian being taught in church / bible school to kids and adults.

The fact is that our nation consists of a majority population that couldn't give a damn about what's right, what needs to be fixed, what's accurate, what's fair and what needs to be done. Need implies now. Some of these old farts are catching on and it's quite obvious that they're moving with the will of the people and the world as it is now that they can see and acknowledge. But that doesn't negate that we have 50 to 70 year olds in positions of power that were created along with our ""dynasties of thought and process"" when the population was much smaller, much less was known about the world in general and even more so on a personal level. The only time we'll see change is when someone who is brilliant and 30 now is elected to the office of President of the US or the leader of other nations. I doubt we'll see even a drop in age limit, because of course you have to be old to be wise and competent in those eyes. What's more is that by the time those my age now are elected to office, no doubt many will be bitter or have fallen in line with the traditions as they exist now. What disturbs me the most is that if you're not associated with a religious group and claim to be Christian I'd be willing to bet that (in the US and in some cases other countries) you're not going to get elected to office in any capacity governing a large population. I'd be willing to bet that the average age of PLAIN is 30-50. Because those are the people who have been most exposed to what a problem these systems are. I'd also venture a guess that they haven't had much of an impact. These people, these guys and gals who get elected into office believe that because they're in office, they make the decisions that affect us all and just because you know better and can prove it doesn't give you the right to override their authority. It's sad and sick. I'm not equating that with Divine Right, but you do the math and once you check the work tell me if I'm wrong or right. I know I'm right. Even more so what's fucked up about it is, that those who control those positions or are in them believe firmly that they don't have to listen to the people, especially those that count most - our most brilliant, educated and intelligent. Sure, they seek their counsel at times but that's not allowing them to advise and check you. If our nation is doomed to failure or ""destined"" to keep slowing itself down and hurting our own people, that's the reason. 

I mean, take the presidential election. We don't vote on a president. We vote on electors and those in areas where they can get to vote or have the means and ability to vote elect the electors. Going a bit further into that, the electors can address half of he population of an area in most cases by addressing Churches and having Churches support them. The same goes for all electoral processes. But really, we don't vote on the president. There's room in there for people to not get a chance on it. There's movements fighting to get the vote back to the people, too, because this would make a change that fits in with our liberties and rights. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)",funny

6544,"They're just two completely different styles - like comparing classical and jazz. Classical musicians are going to be almost unfailingly superior to jazz players in technical execution, but that doesn't make the music they play ""better"". Jazz employs improvisation heavily, and uses non-standard timings that classical players often struggle with. 

Jones is one of if not the best guitarists at, rather than playing a whole lot of notes fast, playing the *right* note at the right time, and utilizes atonality expertly. He makes incredible use of tone and bends. He can play the same chord twice and have it sound completely different each time. 

Hammett is a world class technical guitarist - there is little he can't play. There is nothing Jones plays that he *can't* play. But his composition style is completely different. His riffs and solos utilize complex arrangement and require technical perfection. He's almost mathematic in his precision. 

As a semi-retired shredder, I loved Hammett. I was able to play everything off of *Ride The Lightning*, and I felt like I could play anything after conquering that. 

Then I discovered Tool. 

I still cannot play 4 degrees correctly. I can play all the notes, all the chords, all the riffs, but I can not get it to sound like Jones does.  The guy is just fucking amazing. ",Music

6551,"&gt;As far as I can say, Zvyagintsev does not and just mimics Bergman and his own previous movies at this point. 
  
there's nothing he has in common with bergman aside from the fact that they both make dramas that happen to be pessimistic. bergman's style is far more theatrical than zvyaginstev's
 
&gt;Oh, he does. Ask any Russian director that inspires to be auteur 
  
isn't the go-to russian auteur usually tarkovsky? if anything, i feel like sukorov is far more influential if we're talking about contemporaries.  
  
&gt;And everyone else is... not. We already have one secure director who's going to bring us profits, prestige and awards every single time, so why should we, Russian producers, produce anyone else? 
  
seems like more of a problem with russian producers than him, not to mention that french financiers were the ones that poured money into loveless.

6552,"&gt; The US isn't a model to follow.

Europe follows that model already. Because the US also allows everyone who sets foot on US soil to request asylum. And they will then follow their obligation from that age old refugee convention (that was created with the Holocaust in mind, to prevent that countries can reject people who ask for protection) to check if the applicant needs protection. And if that's the case they will issue asylum, in the US that happened 26,124 times in 2015. 

If the US would geographically be were Europe is they would face the same problems. It's their geographic position that keeps the asylum seekers out, nothing more. Because to reach the US from Nigeria you basically have to travel with a commercial airline. And they don't let you aboard if you don't have a US visa. And if they let you aboard, the airline is obligated to return you if your asylum request is rejected. 

Europe doesn't have that luxury. Asylum seekers don't enter via plane. 


And no, Trump did not abolish the asylum system. As far as I know he didn't even touch it, because that would mean to abolish the UN refugee convention. This is about asylum, the right of someone to request protection when they are on your soil. That's not the same thing as being a refugee who requests protection from outside your country. Europe deals a 100% with asylum cases. Unlike the US we don't have a permanent scheme that allows people to request protection from outside of the country. We resettled a couple ten thousand people from UNHCR camps, but these efforts were limited in scope and time.

6553,"They were not so hot in the spring season 6 but made it finals and went 3-2 vs CLG. Then the summer they dominated and went 17-1. Google that's shit fool. 

And I literally just said this as well. CLG 3-0d TSM with double and Pob, then 3-2 without them then fell off the map. All the while Huhi literally couldn't play a mid not named ASol. Now SINCE THAT POINT, Huhi has come a long way. 

And I don't even know how to respond to you saying I'm lying. Literally 17-1 in the summer split. Like Wtf do your homework. 

I understand you see the similarity. But I think we know the truth that double would undoubtedly have won the starting position back and I highly doubt WT got to see much action. They mightve made videos and played it off like they liked them equally(and there might be some truth in there) but Turtle isn't as good a fit, even if he is a serviceable ADC.

I know there is a whole range of reasons that FNs don't file their taxes, but there is no actual data collected stating what the significant rational is for this situation, nor is there any data presented in the article.  This article quotes a few people and sort of presents that as 'fact' or the standard. 

These articles don't help at all.  Reminds me of media putting a spotlight on an overpaid chief, which some will infer that LOTS of chiefs are milking the system.  Meanwhile the number of chiefs that are 'overpaid' is small relative to the number of communities out there.  In fact, the financial transparency act revealed that chiefs make fairly moderate salaries.  I think mean salary was between 50-75K.  I think something like 5-6% of chiefs make more than $100k/year, but years ago Ezra was out there spewing shit about the 'millionaire chiefs club.'

&gt;I have to say that the case for Jeter as a Gold Glove quality shortstop is a dead argument in my mind. There is a lot we don’t know, and Derek Jeter could be a better shortstop than we have measured him as being for any of a dozen reasons. He is not a Gold Glove quality shortstop.

&gt; U2 is an alternative rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the band’s formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles.

&gt; Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.

&gt; The 70s &amp; 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree &amp; the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).

&gt; The 90s: Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ”watch out, baby”, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) &amp; Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as “The Fly”, “Mirrorball Man” and “Mr. MacPhisto” for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage.

&gt; The 00s: At the end of the 90’s into 00’s U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono’s good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they’ve returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can’t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono’s father who passed away shortly after the album’s conception and 2004’s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.

&gt; The 10s: U2 went on the  U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse.

&gt; The Name: There are many theories as to the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious candidates include “You too” and “You two”, etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name’s origins remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons… U2

&gt;Vayne is hard because so many people feel the need to focus her ASAP compared to other ADC's.

that's kind of flawed because it's really consistent, it depends on your elo, the enemy team, you could have a 1-0 ezreal get heavily focused because he is the biggest threat on that team just for example. Also there is teams that DO NOT focus a vayne either because they are not very good, or there is a bigger threat than her, that's a very loose argument. It is one thing to condemn an ally W'in you, it is another to know how to position yourself to instead stun the ally to a wall, that takes some skill.

Caitlin's Q is only used early game, it's a pretty wide skillshot used mainly pushing the wave and if you can hit the enemy as well with it, it's not really that difficult of an ability to land not as say an Ezreal Q which is even more crucial to him, a Cait can win late without ever landing a Q on an enemy champion simply by hard shoving the lane.

Her is pretty hard to miss since it's pretty wide and fast ability, plus a lot of times you'll be using it against a champion running towards you.

A lot of other champions who's ults require good positioning such as Draven, Ezreal,Twitch, Ashe. Plus her ult is guaranteed damage unlike a lot of other ADCs.

That's why I don't care: you are implying some kind of message in the things I wrote, which simply isn't there. You're perception is clouded by your desperation. 

I don't care, because it's not my place to care. I've cared a few years ago and then it turned out that ""caring"" doesn't help.

Anyways, you can have those weapons, I don't care. I really don't. Use them, tell yourself, that they gonna help you getting those territories back. 

I'm not a nihilist. I'm a realist. The only solution for Ukraine is getting Russia to agree to fuck off. Gifting weapons to Ukraine, won't change shit. Russia is completely ok with the situation right now. A ton of new weapons will simply kill a few more people. Aks Putin how much he cares about that. If there's one thing Russia has, besides gas and oil, it's a bigger shitload of old weapons.

So what will we have in the end? The US will gift you some weapons. By that they'll make sure to get a foot into the market. They'll start making money, thanks to the fucked up situation in the Donbass region. Ok, not they, the military-industrial complex. Nothing will change after that. A few, ok a lot more, people will get shot. A lot of ammunition will be spent, but wait, now you're firing that other shit. Not the old AK ammo. Now you started using the NATO ammo. Someone will have to sell you new ammo, after you started using the new shit. Let's guess, who that will be.

And then, hmm, wait if one batallion is starting to use the new weapons, then why stop there. You can't have different systems, that would be stupid. No army is using the Russian and the NATO system at the same time. You would need to buy ammunition for both systems. Nah, that's bullshit, let's simply switch...I guess, you will need a few more weapons, in order to have a uniform system in the army. So now someone needs to sell you a few more rifles. 

And if you're already using the rifles, why stop there? What about your outdated RPGs...we all know, that the US anti-armor weapons are way more effective, you want to buy a few? We have a good deal for you and if you want we could get you a few used F-16, too. Poland has them and some other EE countries. And if you actually plan on becoming a NATO member, it would be best if you would buy them as soon as possible.

So now 10-15 years have passed, you have new American rifles, new anti-tank weapons and some new (used) nice airplanes. But the Donbass will still be, in the best case scenario some kind of Transnistria like republic, where nobody shoots anybody, in the worst case a fuckin war-zone. The only difference will be the ammunition you fire. And a few people, who got rich(er) along the way. A few Ukrainian guys are quite happy reading these news right now, I'm sure. They're sitting in your army and are ready to get bribed.

But yeah, I don't care, you can have those weapons. I'm not against it. They won't change a thing. *That's* why I don't care. Because they won't change shit. ",europe

The thing that blows my mind the most is when new recruits and trials complain and ask for gear on the first night they are brought in, like ""why did that guy got the piece if it was a better upgrade for me"" well because in the great scheme of things that piece was due to that guy because it completed his 2 set or his 4 set, allowed him to use a BiS legendary, many reasons, you just dont go and in your first week in a new job, ask for a raise.

There is a lot that the guild leadership has to take into account, if you are gearing to kill bosses sometimes an ilvl upgrade for someone is not a good reason to give them loot yet.

I hope you end up finding a guild that fits you, in this game finding a place that you can call home makes it more enjoyable but dont forget that the guys in charge are also people and that they can make mistakes and the best way to find a solution is to talk, find the officers share your thoughts in a good way if they are good and decent people they will hear you and even fix the problem that you are having, communication is the best thing you can have in a guild.

&gt; Noir Désir was a French rock band. The band was founded in Bordeaux, France, in 1985 by singer Bertrand Cantat, drummer Denis Barthe, guitarist Serge Teyssot-Gay and bassist Frédéric Vidalenc (replaced in 1996 by Jean-Paul Roy). Over the years, they became famous in France, releasing albums every few years.

&gt; Theo Hakola from Passion Fodder produced their first LP in 1987 Où veux-tu qu'je r'garde ?. This 6 tracks album shows what would become a Noir Désir trademark: finely crafted lyrics with powerful rock sound. 

&gt; Noir Désir's second album, Veuillez rendre l'âme (à qui elle appartient), released in 1990, introduced punk rock elements to their sound. This continued with their next album, Tostaky, which contained the successful song Tostaky.

&gt; One of the most popular rock groups in France, their success continued with the release of the dance-influenced 666.667 Club, and the remix album One Trip One Noise. Their last album, 2001's Des visages des figures, was a slower, more ambitious affair. This album also contained a collaboration with a fellow francophone Manu Chao. ""Des visages, des figures"" was the album of the consecration for the group which won the music award (Victoire de la Musique) of the best rock album of year 2002, as well as the award of best clip for ""Le Vent nous portera"". Although their last album seemed to be the slowest one, the following gigs were huge rock shows where thousands of fans came to see the group.

&gt; In 2003, allegedly on a drug binge, Bertrand Cantat slapped his girlfriend, Marie Trintignant during an argument in a hotel room in Lithuania. As she fell, her head hit the bed, and she consequently bled to death. Marie Trintignant was a popular French actress and was working on a movie. A Lithuanian judge sentenced Cantat to 8 years in prison after a jury convicted him of manslaughter. He was sentenced in Lithuania and served his sentence in a prison near Toulouse in France.

&gt; In September 2005, an album, En public, which contains highlights of their last tour. They also released a DVD set, Noir Désir en images, which contains various live performances, footage and videos. Special permission was obtained in order to allow the imprisoned Cantat to participate in the development of those.

&gt; Noir Désir members have not ruled out the possibility of re-forming once Cantat is released from jail. Cantat was released early on account of good behaviour on October 16th, 2007, but immediately retreated to his house near Bordeaux.  At the time, he would not speak to the press regarding his musical future.

&gt; In November 2008, two free tracks were released.  The band wished to show, with this release, that productive and cathartic, works from Noir Désir still  impregnate the French scene with intellectual and emotional abuse.

&gt; Teyssot-Gay has stated that the group is currently in the process of composing and recording a new album which he feels should be finished in 2009. However according to a May 14, 2009 article in Le Parisien the album will not be ready until January 2010.

&gt; On November 29, 2010 it was announced that guitarist Serge Teyssot-Gay was leaving the band citing ""emotional, human and musical differences"" with lead singer Cantat.

&gt; On November 30, 2010 band's drummer Denis Barthe announced that Noir Désir is disbanded for good and that is useless to let the band live with ""artificial respiration"". Read more on Last.fm.

7170,"&gt;&gt; The majority of Overwatch players play Quick Play as their primary mode.

Take a second and step back to think about this. The **MAJORITY** of players play QP as their primary (in many cases only) mode. Imagine being a person who doesn't like comp and only plays QP. Would you really play game after game not giving a shit about winning? No, of course not. You try to win just like everyone else.

The idea that ""QP doesn't matter"" is something that *people who play comp* think, because to them it doesn't matter, it's the casual non-serious version of the ""real game"". But for someone who only plays QP, the sentence ""QP doesn't matter"" doesn't make sense, because to them **QP = Overwatch**.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/89057a2bfdb24bed8e77c61b49eb7624.png)  

&gt; The Stanley Brothers (Carter Stanley, 1925-1966, and Ralph Stanley, 1927-2016) were an American bluegrass duo originally hailing from Dickenson County, Virginia. The family soon moved to McClure, Virginia, where their parents worked a small farm in the Clinch Mountains. Music was a part of their lives from the word go, as they were able to listen to the likes of The Monroe Brothers, Mainer's Mountaineers, and other artists featured on the Grand Ole Opry radio program.

&gt; The War interrupted any thoughts of a musical career, and it was not until both brothers returned from the service that they were able to make their own mark in music -- ultimately ending up on WCYB Bristol, Tennessee, where they would remain for over ten years as stalwarts of the famed ""Farm and Fun Time"" radio show. Their music initially followed a more old time style favored by Mainer's Mountaineers, with Ralph playing the banjo in the old two-finger style, interspersed with old time clawhammer playing, before taking a stab at the new three-finger style popularised by Earl Scruggs.

&gt; They formed The Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. They were perhaps the first band to adopt the new music style created by Bill Monroe in the mid-1940s that later became known as bluegrass. Carter played guitar and sang lead while Ralph played banjo and sang with a strong, high tenor voice. Their harmonies are much admired, and many consider Carter Stanley to be one of the greatest singers in the history of country music. The brothers also wrote many of their own songs and Carter had a particular knack for writing deceptively simple lyrics that portrayed strong emotion. The Stanley's style can best be described as a traditional ""mountain soul"" sound that remained close to the Primitive Baptist vocal stylings they learned from their parents and others near their southwestern Virginia home. 

&gt; The early Stanley Brothers recordings on Rich-R-Tone (of Johnson City, Tennessee) included Pee Wee Lambert on mandolin. They later added an innovative touch to their traditional sound with the guitar solos of George Shuffler who often used a crosspicking style.

&gt; Carter performed briefly with Bill Monroe while Ralph was recovering from injuries received in an automobile accident in 1951. As bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida to headline the weekly Suwannee River Jamboree radio show on WNER. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast. Otherwise the brothers performed together until 1966 (from 1961 on as a duo). After Carter's death Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys and is still performing in 2006. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys are Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, Larry Sparks, Curly Ray Cline, Jack Cooke, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph's career received a big boost with his prominent role on the phenomenally successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?."" The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1992.

&gt; Among the Stanley Brothers' best known recordings are:
*   I'm A Man of Constant Sorrow (1950, Columbia)
*   Rank Stranger
*   Angel Band

&gt; The 2 Bears are a British musical duo formed in 2009 composed of Joe Goddard (of electronic band Hot Chip) and Raf Rundell (previously of 1965 Records). The duo produces original material amalgamating various styles including 2-step, house, hip-hop and soul and also host a radio show on Ministry of Sound Radio entitled ""Follow the Bears"". Critics offer various descriptions of The 2 Bears' sound including ""pop-hip-house"", ""liquid-bmore-house-step"" and ""rave-garage"". The 2 Bears have received UK national radio support from DJs including Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills, Nick Grimshaw, Greg James, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Kissy Sell Out, Dev, Rob Da Bank and John Kennedy. The duo have produced remixes for several established artists including Santigold, Metronomy, Toddla T and The View.

&gt; Raf Rundell, a former press officer, and Joe Goddard, one fith of electronic music band Hot Chip, met while working together at the Greco-Roman soundsystem parties. Joe has told how the band originated from the suggestion of a friend who proposed that he, Raf and Joe Mount (from the band Metronomy) form a band called 'The 3 Bears'. The band ultimately formed as a two piece without Joe Mount. During their formative studio sessions Raf &amp; Joe created the tracks 'Mercy Time' and 'Be Strong', which went on to appear on their first EP 'Follow The Bears', released by Southern Fried Records in early 2010. 'Follow The Bears' was supported by a subsequent remix EP featuring contributions from Derrick Carter &amp; Supabeatz. The Bears went on to release a further two EPs on Southern Fried Records, 'Curious Nature EP' in the latter part of 2010 and 'Bearhug EP' in early 2011. Both were accompanied by further remix EPs with contributors including Maxxi Soundsystem and Midland. The 2 Bears first complete album Be Strong was released on January 29, 2012, and was preceded by the single 'Work' on January 2. The single was included on the XFM playlist. They also made a mix album, 2 Bears 1 Love which featured Wiley, Toddla T, and remixes from the 2 Bears. They also announced a second LP titled 'The Night is Young' was to be released in September 2014 on Southern Fried Records. Read more on Last.fm.

The only Kubrick release I've been alive for was *Eyes Wide Shut* but I don't remember it at all, so I can't say for sure, but I imagine that waiting for his films is a lot like how it was like waiting for *There Will be Blood* and what it's like now, waiting with excruciating intensity for *The Master*.",movies

Slavin is more likely to play in the the defensive zone than Jones but still maintains a +/- of 18 higher than Jones. +/- is not the end all be all of statistics but it does help look at the larger picture. Despite that Jones is more likely to start in the offensive zone he does not come away with a significantly higher number of points, being only 6 more, but with 7 games less played. Slavins blocked shots and takeaways are significantly higher than Jones. Jones is still a great player but I wouldn't say he is far and away better than Slavin.",hockey

Dave said in the ""Inside the episode"" that the payoff from the end scene was the facial expressions, and they said that was their main focus of the scene or something. Same with the Arya/Nymeria scene. 

Those were great scenes and all but their incompetence is starting to show imo. It's pretty much confirmed that they only added Dorne to the show to show off Indira Varma (Ellaria Sand), and that mentality seemed to be similar in the way they perceive these new scenes. If that's their focus, it seems like they want to rush through the meat and potatoes of the story to get to those payoff shots.

Given that the first of those 28 individuals had, in fact, played for the Chicago National League Ball Club.

Yeah, they weren’t known as the Cubs when Anson played. They had several nicknames—all unofficial—until the club officially adopted ’Cubs’ in 1907. Anyway, the article used the club’s foundation date (1876), which would include Anson.

&gt; Current members: David Boyd, Søren Hansen, Louis Vecchio
Past members: Poul Amaliel

&gt; David and Soren had been writing songs together for over three years (for respective solo albums that have yet to see the light of day) when they realized that they had unintentionally started a band. The pair had experimented with every imaginable style of music (every imaginable style) and suddenly recognized that the combination of their musical sensibilities, as witnessed on the 300 songs theyd penned together, created something new and interesting. Plus, the rambunctious, beat-driven nature of the songs offered Soren a chance to freak out and go crazy onstage while David showcased his impressive break-dancing moves.

Even if the local foods didn't even resemble a sandwich in the slightest, I'd not consider that a major hurdle to accepting the broad detail of the story either since again, for English speaking audiences it could very likely have just been shorthand for 'light food' which also works regardless of the time of day as well.

The beauty of this approach is that they can put more work into 2 ""halls"", making them evolve visually when you reach certain milestones or something. Sort of like the garrison I suppose, I still maintain that the garrison in and of itself wasn't the problem with WoD, it was the things the devs decided to do with it.

My personal favorite idea: the ""hall"" would be an airship, like the ones in Icecrown. It would also lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that you're not in an instanced area, that the other players with you on this airship are in fact in another airship from another group of players, better than the garrison did since it was stationary.

&gt; Manowar is a metal band from Auburn, New York, United States that prominently features mythology and fantasy in their lyrics as well as songs about Heavy Metal and a theme of camaraderie with rebellious attitude.

&gt; Manowar was founded by bassist Joey DeMaio and guitarist  Ross ""Ross the Boss"" Friedman in 1980. Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.

&gt; After agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the ""man with lungs of leather"", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, ""Battle Hymns"", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, ""Into Glory Ride"" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood. 

&gt; Manowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; ""Sign of the Hammer"" was published by 10 Records - hence the song ""All Men Play on 10"" included on this album.

&gt; In the beginning of 1987, ""Fighting the World"" was released, featuring hit songs such as ""Fighting the World"", ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Defender"". Followed by a tour in Europe, ""Fighting the World"" was a success.

&gt; Their next album, ""Kings of Metal"" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as ""Blood of the Kings"" and ""The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)"". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them ""The Kings of Metal"".

&gt; Not being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as ""Rhino"" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, ""The Triumph of Steel"" published in 1992. After finishing their ""Secrets of Steel"" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.

&gt; 1996 saw the release of ""Louder than Hell"", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks ""Gods Made Heavy Metal"", ""The Power"", ""Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)"" and ""Return of the Warlord"".

&gt; After some more touring and the change of millennium, ""Warriors of the World"" was released in 2002, featuring tracks ""Warriors of the World (United)"" and one dedicated to Italian fans, ""Nessun Dorma"", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.

&gt; Manowar has also released six live-DVD's, ""Hell on Earth"" Parts I-V and ""The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power"", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called ""Sons of Odin"" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled ""Gods Of War"".

&gt; Also in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.

&gt; In August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest ""Thunder in the sky"" EP, part of ""The Asgard Saga"" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song ""Father"" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!

In what way does Ant-Man continue the story of the Avengers movie? It doesn't.

* Aesthetics, obviously. Everything from character designs, backgrounds, and movements are very different from western cartoons. I don't think western cartoons are ""worse"" in this sense, but I don't find them nearly as appealing to me aesthetically as anime.

* Genres/Styles - There are just straight up genres that are missing or so completely different in the US that they might as well not exist. 

For example, shounen action. What is the closest thing that the US has that even comes close to this. Maybe...PG-13 movies? Action cartoons? But cartoons are overwhelmingly skewed towards comedy and the closest thing we've had, Avatar, seemed to be the exception moreso than the rule. In terms of movies, the animated varieties tend to be comedy moreso than action and the action movies all tend to be live-action.

And that is not mentioning things such as Slice of Life/Iyashii, Sports, mecha etcetc.

* Japanese voice acting - Japan has a giant pool of talented and diverse voice actors whom I love hearing. I am not bashing dubbers or American voice actors -- They are also very talented.

Our immigrant communities from our former colonies are fairly well established and integrated.

The land of the jewish people belong to the jewish people, not only the jews thet live there, you cant make it a private club, this has 0 logic.

&gt;B. They have been there since way before the 19 century, they deserved their land and by they I mean the Muslims, Jews and Christians that lived their since even before the ottoman empire, after the British mandate ended, they should have had their chance to declare their state from within themselves, but instead they faced thousands of foreigners being injected into their land and declaring their state

19th century is natives?

they had a chanch for a state, as i said before, were gready and wanted the entire land for themselfs  and had to face the consequences. anyone can declare their own state, but who exetly recognize it?

You dont seem to know anything about the zionist movement with the way you think and talk. The jewish people wanted a land for the jewish people especially after the holocaust. injected? the britians didnt allowed jews to enter even though they were being genocided? how exectly they were injected if they werent even allowed to enter? Israel was declared a state in UN vote, how exectly has it declared it own independence?


&gt;The British promised to give the land that weren't there's to begin with to European zionists after wwii, is rael was only created because some shady British polatics and after thousands were injected into the land. And regarding the war, is rael was heavily backed by US and UK, so realistically its UK, US vs the other countries

What are zionists? jews. what  homeland was promised? a jewish one.

The US had 0 involvement in this war, the only involvment thet the UK had was assisting the arabs and hurting  israel ability to fight.

The UN Proposed a soultion to divide the land to jewish and arab one, jews accepted it, arabs didnt they wanted the entire land. israel were declared a state with **UN VOTE, it cant declare its own  independence. Large Jewish immgration to israel happend decades before this. british mandate didnt allowed the immgration of jewish people.

But israel were declared by a UN vote, i dont get your point.

If you liked *Full Metal Alchemist*, give *Full Metal Panic* a try. It is nothing like *Full Metal Alchemist*, it is a mecha action romantic comedy that for mysterious reasons has a similar name. And it is a great series. There are large metal people shaped thingies in it however, so you won't be entirely lost.

If you liked *Deathnote*, then you might like *Potemayo* as it has a cute little death ray shooting demon/shinigami character in the supporting cast. I don't think anyone dies, but several characters become very embarrassed in the course of the series. However, I feel I must warn you, there is some pee pee.

Edit 2: There is a series based on a manga by the same authors that created Deathnote. It is about a couple of young boys who set out to become the authors of a manga that inspires a hit anime series. Think of it as a fictionalized ""Making of Deathnote"" documentary.  Meta, no?

Ok you lost me here. How is this at all a good ""indicator of what's going on""? You said yourself that people can no longer support themselves and their family in the current job market. I completely agree, jobs are flowing out of Canada thanks to corporate monopolies and outsourcing. The price of living skyrocketed in recent decades and wages can not rise in accordance. Race has jack shit to do with any of this. Canadians are being forced ignore that the needs of international corporate entities are being placed before the needs of the Canadian people. ""breaking it down into race"" is a way to distract people from the real problems and get the population fighting amongst themselves. A perpetually divided nation will never be able to organise and ensure the ruling powers functions for the well being of the nation. An international corporate entity is not loyal to any one nation, their only interest is to ensure that the people of the nations in which they do business do not impede their means of profit. This ""diversity is a strength"" tripe being pushed on Canadians is a monument to this. Not only does the importation of low payed workers benefit corporate monopolies, it also further divides and ""diversifies"" the nation rendering it rudderless as it is occupied with the social disarray caused by lack of consensus and unity.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

The separatists in Georgia are increasingly frustrated and disillusioned by Russia, increasingly seeing how they were mere pawns again Georgia rather than actually being on the path to joining Russia.

Crimea is another huge money sink which is now losing all its freshwater, which is causing the landscape to revert to dry steppes again, and Russia didn't actually ""secure"" anything there. Their naval base was never at risk.

And eastern Ukraine is a dangerous training ground for armed ultranationalists (that could totally never go wrong in the future), and everything done to Ukraine has destroyed the sense of cultural kinship that used to be dominant.

And people are going to start noticing this stuff when the Putinmania dies with Putin. No successor will have the same approval ratings or perceived track record, and everyone in power is already aware of how Putin has structured the state apparatus to work around *him* rather than his office. And the longer he lives, the worse it will get when his reign ends. If he pulls a Mugabe, Russia is going to have serious problems.

While there may have been some ""bandwagon jumping"", that isn't evidence that the current push for a more inclusive multicultural society is in any way related. There isn't tons of people going ""those damn cis-gendered people are destroying my society and taking away everything, so we need to eliminate them!"" I'm sure there are some, but not to the level that Nazi Germany was brought to. In reality, those types are few and far between, and more likely to be denounced than held up as a perfect example of the cause. 

And Nazi Germany happened because of all the sanctions against Germany after WW1, which Hitler used to blame on a certain section of people as the cause in a power grab that actually reinvigorated Germany for a short time. There was a LOT more going on than just racist dogma and fashionable fervor. The entire country was feeling the effect of the sanctions and were struggling to get by. Some people listened to Hitler and just wanted to take back what they felt was theirs, and they weren't really picky about who they were taking it from. Jews just happened to be an easy target, since for the most part they were visibly distinguishable from Aryan Germans and already had a stigma of being money grubbers attached to them, whether that was deserved or not.

By trying to equate Nazi Germany to multiculturalism, you're dismissing everything that both multiculturalism AND Nazism stand for.

The intangible benefits go as far as making 'a statement' that we are no longer a selling club, avoiding fan and media unrest from selling our top scorer after falling out of the top 4 that could severely hamper our season, etc.

&gt; If you look at the club's spending, the net spend was £32m in 2013/14, £78m in 2014/15, £22M IN 2015/16, £87M IN 2016/17. The average net spend is just over £50m/season, and high spending seasons are typically followed by low-spending seasons. 

This season has already killed that trend, but anyway, I'm failing to see what your point is here? Our average net spend being ~£50m (as I said before we could actually spend slightly more if we wanted) doesn't suggest we are just scraping by?

Anyway, I don't disagree that there's an argument for selling, I just think there's an equally valid one for keeping him - a last point being that a lot of things can happen in a year and there's a chance he could be convinced to stay.",soccer

7914,"Legion, like WoD has some detrimental factors, but I think a lot of the positive features in Legion are evolutions over MoP and WoD.  The Challenge Dungeons evolved into Mythic+.  The rotating dailies and daily zones evolved into the World Quest system.  The crafting system staying relevant as a catch up mechanic evolved from WoD's crafting system.  Class Order Halls add to the game without feeling like WoW is becoming a mobile management game, the way Garrisons were.  The trickling content was started in MoP and evolved into what we have today.

Some things did take a step back, though.  The leveling experience, although temporary, is a downgrade from WoD.  The legendaries system is a tough sell.  MoP started and WoD continued the trend of ""everyone gets a legendary if you put in the time!""  Legion tried to keep that, but make it rewarding early and stay relevant.  They did not do a great job of that, IMO.  I'm fine with the idea of RNG based legendary drops, but there should be a system to work towards replacements so you don't get totally hosed by RNG.  Also, the more screwed you get with the current system, the worse off you are as it's increasingly harder to get further legendaries.

On its own, the biggest system Legion added seems to be Artifacts.  Overall, I rate them well.  Artifact Knowledge has served as a nice gate/catch up mechanism that rewards the grind, but still enables relative catch up.  Interestingly, they're not done with artifacts yet.  I also wonder how they'll move on from the artifact system in the next expansion.

Overall, I'd say Legion feels better than WoD, but it also took a lot of features and feedback from WoD to make Legion possible.",wow

Dallas's defense isnt as sexy as Nashville's but if Bishop could do what Niemi and Lehtonen couldnt and keep them in games they are a lock imo for a spot. Only thing that sticks out is how old spezza is and that forwards age like milk when theyre 34-36

St.Louis I feel I dont know enough about their players to make a real statement

Nashville imo didnt really get better but they didnt really get worse. Losing Neal and Fisher sucks and Bonino has more of a rep as a playoff warrior over a regular season and Hartnell is 36. Their defense is still juicy as fuck though and RV still has room to improve.

Chicago is gonna be a one we all will argue over but I think they can still make the playoffs. Saad for Panarin is basically an 70pt player for a 60pt player with an allround better game for the team. Kane may not be in the Art Ross hunt but I think he can still be PPG since he already has been with no 2C and without a decent LW his entire career. Toews I think will get a decent boost offensively with Saad and could likely get 65pts. Murphy I never watched enough of him but I think playing with Keith can do him some good maybe not replace hammer but at least lessen the blow of it. What people seem to forget is Schmaltz, Hartman, Forsling will likely improve and be better than last season especially Schmaltz who was really good the 2nd half and helped Toews go on a tear. Kempny is also a advanced stats god according to hero charts and has been good when he played. Will have 5 million in cap space when Hossa is LTIR'd so they will likely add someone too.

But correct my math if it's wrong:
Using numbers provided...

But I see what you mean.  As it was, he would have been out, most likely.  I still think if he ran full speed out of the box, he has a good chance of making it. Even though 1.85 seconds seems like a lot.

edit: Let me put it like this.  If I were the 3B coach, I would think there were greater odds that Gordon scores (if he were running out of the box) than him scoring on Perez's at bat vs. Bumgarner.  

Maybe even better odds running as he was /s.  Bumgarner was untouchable that whole series.",baseball

I also think Ter Stegen did very good in the tournament so I don't think Neuer would have had that much impact. Still a very huge difference between Ter Stegen and Neuer.

With Boateng-Hummels-Kroos I agree. As I said I see them kinda as the heart. Also Werner was very good. However I wonder why you don't list Stindl? Mueller is Mueller but he is hard to fit in a system. The thing is with Reus/Draxler on the wings I can see Müller playing a position that fits him well. About the rest I'm not sure. Oezil is a great player for example but sometimes he just goes invisible.

Alot of people say Germany won with a total 'B' 11 but I still think most of them are very good players and was just overlooked for a long time and could be contender for the starting spots.

Saint Peter is standing outside heavens gate, looking over the crowd of people standing in line. Each are waiting to get into heaven. He clears his throat, and announces to the mass ""Good people, heaven is over crowded at the moment, and you may be waiting here for some time. For now, we will permit entry only to those who died an unfortunate or horrible death.""

A man steps up. ""St. Peter, I died horribly. I had come home after a hard day at work, my wife greeted me and I suddenly got this gut feeling she had just cheated on me. I figure the guy is still in the house, so I started looking for him. I checked under the bed - no one; In the wardrobe - no one; in the closet - no one. I turn my house upside down and find nobody! Feeling a little stressed I go out on the balcony for a smoke, AND THERE HE IS! Hanging off the railing, the bastard thought to hide from me! So, I start beating about his face and the bastard is still hanging on. I grab a nearby hammer and start smashing his fingers, and he finally lets go and falls. That asshole hit the ground from six stories up, and some how he is still alive, trying to crawl away. Caught up in my rage I run to the kitchen, grab the fridge and throw it down on him. As the fridge left my hands, the stress caught up with me, and I had a heart attack.""

St. Peter looks at the man in horror ""Unfortunate, certainly, but deserved! To hell with you!"" and the man vanishes in a flash of fire and brimstone.

A second man walks up ""St. Peter, I died horribly. I am a pretty athletic guy, so today after work when I had a few minutes to do some exercise, it was nice outside and I decided to do it out on my balcony. There I was, doing jumping jacks, when I slipped and fell over the railing. I guess god was watching over me as by some miracle I managed to grab on to the railing of the balcony below me. As I was trying to pull myself up, this guy came out to have a smoke. I made to ask for help, but instead he started punching me in the face! Just when I thought I endured the torture and started to pull myself up again, the guy returns with a hammer and starts hammering away at my fingers! There was too much pain to hold on, and I fell. I hit the ground, thanking god for his mercy, only to find I cannot move my legs. So I tried crawling towards the street to get help, but the last thing I remember is looking up at a fridge flying towards me!""

St. Peter looks at the poor man, feeling great pity for him, and says ""That is indeed unfortunate! Heaven awaits your tortured soul.""

8251,"If Ronaldo can win the BDO without being the best player on his team so can Neymar while still being at Barca.  
And he reaches Messi levels many times a season, he just can't sustain it for long enough. 

Maybe he should be finishing those clear cut chances he has in front of goal instead of blasting them over the post. And this is not an outlier event. If Neymar had the consistency of shots on goal close to that of Messi, he would be having 60-70+ goals a season. Which is because he gets more opportunities to have those moments precisely because there are players like Messi alongside him who are setting him up. 

Its not just a 1 way streak.  

Also he should be passing more to Alba who overlaps 20 times a match and gets passed like once and that too maybe next match. This thing alone makes the situation easier to digest for many a Barca fan (after the price of course).  Its so frustrating to watch. This is not development. Neymar needs to understand this. 

Neymar can develop and reach his ceiling even at Barca. This narrative that because Messi is there he can't become better is the most ridiculous BS i have read on this matter.  

How is Messi's presence impeding Neymar's ability to fucking put the ball in the net when he is freaking getting setup by Messi and through on goal basically 1v1.  
This is on Neymar and Neymar alone and that doesn't change if he is a PSG or United.  
Elite Club football is structured in a way where there is multiple high profile players, even PSG have them, if Sanchez goes you don't think he will take tactical and other sporting space from Neymar. Cavani is already there as well. Its not like Neymar is going to some lowly team where he is the only and only exclusive megastar and will have the ball super majority of time and do everything.

&gt; Ghinzu is an Alternative rock band from Belgium. They were formed in 1999 by a group of musicians who had been on the Belgian rock scene for a number of years, named after a Japanese knife-brand. The current line-up consists of John Israel (also known as ""John Stargasm"") (vocals, keyboard), Mika Nagazaki (bass), Greg Remy (guitar), Antoine Michel (drums), Jean Waterlot (keyboard, guitar). Former members include Kris Dane (keyboard, guitar), Fabrice Georges (drums) and Sanderson Poe (contrabass).

&gt; Their first album, Electronic Jacuzzi, was released in December 2000 labelled by their own Label Company Dragoon and sales quickly topped several thousand. Recorded over several sessions in the spring and autumn of 1999 and 2000, it marks a turning point in contemporary pop and features 12 tracks that travel between groove and noise in an inimitable style.

&gt; The rhythm section is relaxed, radical and original, producing a soaring, elastic groove in perfect contrast to the sound of the guitar and doublebass. This adds a tragic quality to the elegance that the group exudes. This vicious aesthetic evokes the essential elements in pop: piano, trash synths, no-wave melodies and addictive rhythms that create a dramatic tension, bringing to the forefront the tragic necessity that drives rock. But this maturity allows for experimentation: bass duos, piano ballads accompanied by cutting breakbeats, distortions and self-deprecating humour, speed-pop and of course the noise holding it all together. It is modern music whose very conception demands a fresh approach to listening to and playing music. Ghinzu brings out the sounds of the instruments rather than playing them in the standard way.

&gt; The first two singles from the album are ""Dolly Fisher"" (a song about the possibilities of romance between man, plastic and voodoo dolls) and ""Electronic Jacuzzi"" (dedicated to dancefloor fetishists). ""Dolly Fisher"" was immediately put on the Radio 21 playlist before it was even released. This success was followed by several appearances on different Belgian TV stations and a tour that started in 2000 and finished in 2002, taking in around 50 gigs and a mini tour of Flanders.

&gt; Ghinzu released their second album, Blow, in February 2004, an album full of the soul that drives those who live rock as a passage to a different life. The pleasure of listening to this album is in losing yourself within the music and discovering the most incredible characters, the maddest adventures and the most poignant of destinies. An album made to move you without a second thought, in the same way that rock and roll is played. The lyrics exude a kind of venomous dandyism, a sarcastic yet tender vision that draws out social vignettes showcasing the heroes of daily sex and taunting the aristocracy. This exquisite finesse clashes with the controlled and jubilant anarchy of their concerts, as if to assert the undercurrent of the album.

&gt; Everyone has the right to boredom, and only a handful have the duty to fight it- Ghinzu is one of them.

&gt; In August and September 2003, Ghinzu played several festivals to try out their new compositions on stage with their new multi-instrumentalist Kris Dane. Kris has already proved his talents as a solo artist, and he strengthens Ghinzu on stage, playing keyboards and guitar as well as singing. These dates included very well received concerts at Nandrin Festival and the Nuits Botaniques.

&gt; Convinced of the talent and relevance of the group to the modern music world, they were signed by Bang! for distribution and Ghinzu returned to the studio to finish ""Blow"", after four years of sharpening their venomous dandyism.

&gt; Ghinzu was also selected by RTBF to represent Belgium in the European showcase festival ""Eurosonic"", which took place in the Netherlands on 9 January 2004. Following this gig, a number of foreign festivals in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK showed in interest in attracting Ghinzu.

&gt; 2004 was also the year of a sell out gig at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, where Ghinzu played together with two other bands (Girls in Hawaii and Sharko), which was covered by all the Belgian Media.

&gt; In the summer of 2004, Ghinzu played all the major national festivals: Dour, Nandrin, VerdurRock, Pukkelpop etc.

&gt; In Autumn 2004, Ghinzu played a French Tour of around 20 dates to promote their new album (released 7 September). The album was released under the 'Atmospheriques' label (Tarmac, Tahiti 80...), while Radical (Placebo, Moissec, Blonde Redhead) took charge of the French leg of the tour.

&gt; In 2005, Ghinzu started the new year with a tour of a few dates in the Netherlands (Venlo, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Den Bosch), where they had been eagerly awaited since the release of Blow and their appearances at several festivals the previous summer (Valkhofaffaire in Nijmegen, Zinin Festival in Utrecht).

&gt; This was followed by a second sell out gig at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels on 26 January, this time all by themselves.

&gt; After another sell out gig at Paris' L'Elysee Montmartre on 1 February, Ghinzu played their first few gigs in Switzerland. Their tour ended with an invitation to participate in the Montreux Jazz Festival on 15 July supporting the.

&gt; Ghinzu is now in the process of winning over the European public by their irrepressible live performances, backed up by an album which has already made its mark. Before starting their summer festivals tour they will be playing the mythical Olympia on 13 June which has already sold out.

8350,"the stock market has no real limit when you're dealing with large-cap stocks (google, microsoft, goldman sachs, etc.). also, software is so efficient now that you can make trades in milliseconds. if you know exactly how a stock will move in ten minutes, just spend your time watching a large-cap stock until it has a highly volatile ten minutes, then cash in by getting in before every large price swing. 

or if you're really industrious, don't limit yourself to one stock but do the same thing for 20...50...100 stocks.

also by using options you're essentially leveraging the HELL out of a situation. one option contract gives you control over 100 shares. and if you manage to do pre-screening by finding a stock whose options have high delta (relation of change in stock price to change in option price) you're essentially using even more leverage.

&gt; Dispatch originated in the early 1990s as One Fell Swoop, but changed their name to Dispatch in 1996. Chad Urmston, Braddigan, and Pete (Francis) Heimbold, who were all attending Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont comprised the band's lineup throughout their entire career. Their music drew upon several influences, such as acoustic folk-rock, reggae, and funk.

&gt; Dispatch gained much recognition outside of New England, without any help from a label, and stuck together long enough to release seven albums, three of which were live performances. During concerts, the band had been known to improvise upon their album releases, often resulting in a song ending in twice the length of the original. The group was also fond of switching instruments and vocal duties when playing live.

&gt; Upon the announcement of its break-up in 2002, the band scheduled one final concert. The free show was performed at the Hatch Shell in Boston on July 31, 2004. ""The Last Dispatch,"" as it was referred, is said to be the largest concert in independent music history; roughly 110,000 fans from over 20 different countries attended the show. Parts of the performance were released as a CD/DVD two-disc set later that year, entitled All Points Bulletin, along with an earlier show in Somerville, Massachusetts.

&gt; All three of the band's members are currently still in the music industry. Urmston is now the frontman of State Radio, while Corrigan (now credited as Braddigan, a nickname by which he was known since his time with Dispatch) and Heimbold (now credited as Pete Francis, his middle name) are succesfully pursuing solo efforts.

&gt; After the song Elias, written by Urmston after his experience living and teaching in Zimbabwe, the ""Elias Fund"" was formed to send children from the ravaged country to college.

&gt; Dispatch came out with a movie entitled ""Last Dispatch"" in July 2005, which documents their final 12 days together as a band and tells the story of how they became ""the band that redefined independent music history"". The film was released and previewed in Boston. Chad, Brad, and Pete attended the showing and celebrated throughout the weekend with their fans.

&gt; On December 22, 2005, Corrigan helped to organize a benefit concert, known as the Relief Project, at Irving Plaza in New York, New York. Along with several other performers, Corrigan invited Heimbold and State Radio to play. The three reunited very briefly, playing the song Here We Go as an encore. Corrigan stated there that he plans further Relief Project concerts featuring all three and perhaps sometime in 2007, a major Dispatch reunion concert.  
Entitled ""Dispatch: Zimbabwe"", Dispatch arranged for one show in Madison Square Garden, with all the money sent towards relief efforts in Zimbabwe.  Originally billed as a one show deal on July 14, Dispatch was surprised how quickly this first show sold out and set two more shows for the 13 and 15. After all three shows sold out, Dispatch announced another smaller show on July 11th at Webster Hall in  New York, where they made their comeback debut to great success.  

&gt; Dispatch is now having a second set of reunion concerts beginning at Red Rocks amphitheater in Denver, Colorado on June 3, 4, and 5th,  2011. These performances will launch a reunion tour around the US and the release of their new Dispatch EP on May 17th. Read more on Last.fm.

8399,"&gt; Except Kuechly would have been left on the backburner for a couple years since Hurney favored the older guys. Beason would've gotten his spot back from Kuechly under Hurney.

I agree leaving Beason as the MLB and playing Luke at OLB was dumb, but Hurney wasn't deciding that -Rivera was.

&gt; Cam and Kuechly shouldn't count for Hurney, they should both count against Hurney.

What? This makes no sense. There were plenty of people calling Cam a bust and saying we should be taking Von Miller or Marcell Dareus at #1 before the 2011 draft. Hurney stuck to his guns and drafted us a franchise QB. Then in 2012 people wanted us to take Dre Kirkpatrick or Quinton Coples at #8 and Hurney again hit it out of the park with Kuechly.

8442,"Well, northern Italy is probably a destination for immigration, as the EU goes.

But, yeah, you're right -- the EU isn't at the moment a single unit, at least in terms of workers moving in.

I kind of think of the EU as a single unit, since ultimately, any naturalized citizen of an EU member can move wherever they want as long as they're working, and I think that if you legally live and work in an EU member long enough, you normally wind up naturalized.

I was just reading an article on here about the proposal of EU-level social security.  My guess is that ultimately, the EU is going to wind up federalizing or at the minimum having a common welfare budget, because if it doesn't, poorer EU members are just gonna have their welfare systems collapse due to people moving within the EU -- people are gonna move to the ""blue banana"", and eliminating more barriers to migration, like language, are gonna tend to keep propelling that process along.

So for the EU in the long run, my bet is going to be that it will wind up being a unit and having a somewhat-common budget.

Racism is institutionalized. It's the reason why ghettos exist. It's the reason why the 'war on drugs' was started. It is a series of systems and policies designed to keep things the way they are. 

Reverse racism is not real. White people still have more power in the workplace. Asian people might be in the tech industry in a greater number, but think of the management...

8534,"Montreal, Quebec City, and Ottawa can be very picturesque in the winter. However, be prepared for winter highway driving which can get pretty icy. You won't have enough time to make it out to the Maritimes. I think you might be underestimating how far some of these place are from each other. At best in the winter I would expect Detroit to Toronto to be 4 hrs not including the wait at the border. Here are some other driving times:

* Toronto/Hamilton to Ottawa is a 4hr drive
* Toronto/Hamilton to Montreal is a 6hr drive
* Montreal to Ottawa is a 2 hr drive
* Montreal to Quebec City is a 3 hr drive
* Montreal to Detroit is a 9hr drive

I think you should pick one city and do it well with the 6 days you have for your vacation. Considering that each day on either end is going to involve a lot of commuting you end up with 4 full days to explore to your hearts content. As others have said there isn't anything super spectacular about Hamilton. You'll find a lot more to do and see in Toronto. So if you are super into saving some money then spend your nights in Hamilton but your days exploring Toronto.

Another option would be to spend most of your time in a different city altogether - I personally would recommend Montreal. Stop off in Hamilton for lunch on your way to Montreal to visit the relatives. You can take a day trip to either Quebec City (my recommendation) or Ottawa on one of those 4 days that you have. I think you will find Montreal and Quebec City more different - that is more interesting then Toronto. Toronto is a lot like any other big city - but Montreal and Quebec City have their old historic towns which honestly are something to behold. You really can't find anything like it anywhere else in Canada or the US. Its like being transported to Europe - but better because they have poutine and maple syrup. On your way home, visit the relatives again :)

8536,There was a girl who I liked throughout a lot of highschool. She was  never even remotely interested in me. She was nice I guess but she would date my friends and never give me a second look. I lost weight and she just flat out tried to sleep with me. You'd think I'd do it and I was obviously tempted but I didn't partially out of resentment. I get it you need to be physically attracted to someone to have sex with them but it was just SO transparent (I'd literally just lost about 60 lbs and was in well above average physical shape) that I told myself I'd rather not just give in to her first advance after I wanted her for so long.,AskReddit

Montana, Brady, Manning, and Favre are (in my opinion), pretty easy to put over Elway as Favre is a spot lower than the other three and you elegantly made the case for Favre &gt; Elway. I don't think anyone's going to fight for Elway over Unitas, Starr, Graham, or Baugh, either, going back to the legacy greats. That means we need two more quarterbacks to pick up over Elway.

Take your pick of Young, Marino, Stabler, Fouts, Kelly, Rodgers, Bradshaw, Tarkenton, Tittle, or Luckman. And I'm probably missing a few. I think with a detailed list and a better historian of the game than I am, it would be a more interesting question of whether Elway is a top 20 QB of all time.

Now, it's worth emphasizing that that's still *really fucking good.* None of the guys I just listed are anything other than legends, and Elway is definitely in the pantheon of the game's all time greats. But there are a lot of ""top 10 quarterbacks"" and only 10 actual slots, and while there are arguments that kind of slide guys like Bradshaw and Marino around based on what the ranker is valuing, I don't think there's a real argument for Elway.",nfl

8595,"There are many problems with this post. First of all, are you fluent in any of these languages? How will you keep the local population from killing you due to superstitions of witchcraft or other beliefs? 

Secondly, have you studied the geographic and economic history of the Baltic Islands? Many times when Europeans have gone to new lands and tried to use farming methods from their areas on the new land they've found that such farming methods don't work. Do you know what the major crops are and how they are best planted? Do you really think that you know better than a farmer who's been working on the same land for his entire life and has knowledge passed down by generations of farmers on that same land? Are you aware that the Baltic islands have relied heavily on the sea and that you might be better off gaining knowledge about fishing? 

Thirdly, you say ""experiment with charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur"" as if such things are easy to obtain. Where will you acquire sulfur? Saltpeter (ie potassium nitrate) is incredibly difficult to make. Since it takes at least an entire year to make a batch (and that's if you do everything right), it will be some time before you have gunpower, if at all. Since potassium nitrate is dangerous, you'd probably end up killing yourself before you invented gunpowder. 

Fourthly, how do you intend to find this metallurgist and train them in a art which you presumably know nothing about?

Fifthly, how will you avoid all the assassins which will be after you? You are a foreigner. Not many will accept you as a ruler. 

Finally, having taken a course on prehistoric technology in which we attempted to replicate some of these technologies, I can assure you that many technologies that seem simple now are incredibly complex to actually learn and master. So many people in the modern world look down on ancient peoples or HGs as simple and uneducated but, believe me, they managed feats that, without years of skill, training, and passed down knowledge, the vast majority of us would never accomplish.

8670,"This is not new. They always have this regulation. Apparently nobody wants to understand why but just bash them, because, of course, they  are irrational.

The reason is that a gluten-""free"" bread risks it not really being ""bread"". Til what point can we change major components in a thing such that we can still call it *that* thing? If I remove all cellulose from a piece of ""paper"" and replace most of them with plastics, can I still call it a piece of paper?

The reason this is important is because *only* bread can be transformed into the body of Christ (you can mock that idea, but you can suspend your disbelief for a moment just to think in their shoes).  If the ""bread"" is not really bread, then nothing transforms into the body of Christ (the sacrament is not valid).

I’ve been gone the past few days of the rewatch due to AX, but I’ve caught up again. So, briefly, here are my thoughts on the episodes I missed before I talk about today’s episode.
 
**Episodes 35-38**
 
We finally figured out what Rubinsky and the rest of Phezzan have been planning with the former members of the Lippstadt Alliance. They’ve been planning a kidnapping plot of the Kaiser Erwin.
 
What I love about the plan is that the kidnapping is only the first part of the plan. It’s a real wheels-within-wheels kind of plan. Phezzan initiates the kidnapping and gets Erwin to the Alliance. There, they make a government in exile. This will divide political opinion in the Alliance while uniting the people of the Empire for a war against the hated nobility in support of Reinhard. Reinhard gets to launch a war with massive public support to unify the galaxy. It’s brilliant.
 
I didn’t expect Reinhard to get told about the plan by Phezzan. And Reinhard actually goes along with the plan. Reinhard’s always been brilliant, and this shows how good he is at manipulating people. It’s still not clear if Phezzan manipulated Reinhard, or if Reinhard is using Phezzan. Reinhard does threaten Phezzan and demand free access through their borders. This will be an interesting development to follow.
 
The development also once again shows off how ruthless Reinhard can be in sacrificing some subordinates. He may not like it, but he’s always willing to let Oberstein talk him into it. It really does seem like Kircheis and Annerose are the only ones Reinhard did not ever consider as pawns.
 
It’ll be interesting to see how the war develops with Erwin’s exiled government in the Alliance. Reinhard has declared all out war on the Alliance. I’m certain the war will only grow. I expect Phezzan to be involved even more. This is an interesting turn of events.
 
I also want to point out that Erwin is quite a brat. I’d expect no less from a child king.
 
Also, I am kind of surprised that Oberstein really does have a dalmation. For some reason, I thought that rumor would be false. I can’t picture Oberstein being nice enough to care for a dog.
 
**Episode 39**
 
On today’s episode of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Julian has left Iserlohn and is now on his way to Phezzan. I feel like Julian will be at the center of future events because of his new position in Phezzan. 
 
We’re losing people at Iserlohn. Julian is being sent to Phezzan and Merkatz has been appointed to the exiled Imperial government. Some of the best people are leaving.
 
Julian is being sent to Phezzan, which is certainly going to be an important place in the future. Yang tells Julian as much. Yang is always so clever, able to see past the schemes of the people around him. He’s guessed that Reinhard may have allowed Erwin to be kidnapped because Reinhard benefits most from it. And he’s guessed that Phezzan may be helping the Empire to conquer the galaxy and is trying to benefit from that.
 
Julian shows he’s no slouch either. He guesses that Phezzan may have a non-material reason for their actions, like religion or ideology. Considering Phezzan and the Earth Cult are practically the same thing, this is a pretty good observation.
 
I always love Yang’s ruminations on history, as he observes that the situation is going to change. He says people have a tendency to assume the status quo will remain, but warns that something unthinkable like Phezzan teaming up with the Empire can happen. He also once again says there’s no reason the Empire and Alliance will last forever.
 
Julian’s goodbyes were nice to see. I like all the different ways the people said goodbye, as well as the various gifts they gave to him. I have a feeling that knife he got from Schenkopp will be important.
 
I also find it hilarious that everyone is worrying about whether Yang can take care of himself without having Julian around.
 
It’ll be interesting to see Julian acting on his own. He’s already shown that he has a sharp mind, having been raised and trained by Yang. And he’s also been trained in hand-to-hand combat by Schenkopp, as well as learning how to dogfight. I think Julian may become the most OP character in this show if he continues to train in all these. That would be cool to see.
 
Side notes: This is the episode that features [Yang’s scene talking about alcohol being humanity’s friend.](https://youtu.be/E_YxauHnpyg) This is one of the first things I ever saw about Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It’s still hilarious in the show itself.

Wright was obviously a better player than Jeter when healthy, but Wright's peak was nowhere near as long and injuries crushed his career. Wright has a career OPS+ of 133 even with his tremendous decline whereas Jeter only topped that mark 1 time in his 20 year career and Wright was unquestionably a better defender.

**But anyway, fucking seriously, where has our constitutional foundations been challenged in any way what-so-ever comparable to places like Turkey &amp; Poland?**


An hell, even Trump's election, even if I despise the man, is a type of check &amp; balance in itself.

The Electoral System is specifically designed in a way to balance the influence of less populated states with more populated states. Each state is guranteed 3 electors because each state is guranteed that big of a Congressional delegation. 

And while states like New York &amp; California have huge Congressional delegations, they, like everybody else, is limited to only 2 Senators, and thus, the 2 electors that correspond to them. 

So while the most populated states will always determine the President 7-8 times out of 10, when supermajority of smaller states in vote for the other guy, they can override the popular vote, as with Trump. 

And once again, while I despise the man, I'd rather the less-populated rural states have him as a stress release for 4 years than let the wounds fester for 20 years &amp; end up with the disease of serious seccession.

Because than you end up with thinks like Catalonia, Scotland, Basque Country, Northern Ireland, Brexit, Grexit or the clusterfuck that is Belgium.

&gt; Ween is an experimental rock group formed in 1984 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, United States when Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween) met in an eighth grade typing class. Ween collected a large underground fanbase despite being generally unknown in mainstream music circles aside from their 1992 fluke hit “Push th' Little Daisies”. 

&gt; The band's style is eclectic, and while they could generally be referred to as rock, one of their defining tendencies has been experimentation with various styles incorporating a strong element of humor and absurdity. Both Gene and Dean are skilled multi-instrumentalists who overdubbed various instruments on their recordings, though they also record with the regular touring band.

&gt; Their earliest home recordings were anarchic and free-spirited, drawing on influences as far-reaching as Beatles, Queen, Prince, Butthole Surfers, The Residents and the lo-fi punk movement. Ween was often compared in their early years to other offbeat artists such as Frank Zappa and would always eschew such comparisons.

&gt; Ween was signed to Twin/Tone Records in 1989 and released their first album GodWeenSatan: The Oneness in the following year, a 26-track smorgasbord of wild eclecticism. 1991's The Pod became a fast fan favorite, as the duo's use of drum machines, pitch-tweaked guitars &amp; vocals and drug-laced humor became a trademark part of their sound. The Pod, according to Ween-lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being ""the most slime-bag thing we could think of."" The contraption on the album cover is not a Scotchgard inhalation device, but a bong-like device used to send marijuana directly to the brain by use of nitrous oxide, which was said to leave the user intoxicated for days, but nauseated. The cover of The Pod used the cover of the 1975 Leonard Cohen album, The Best of Leonard Cohen, but with the head of Mean Ween (aka Chris ""Cribber"" Williams, a friend of the band) wearing the mask, pasted onto that of Cohen.

&gt; Pure Guava, the first of a series of releases on the Elektra label, featured their highest charting single, ""Push Th' Little Daisies"" (1992) which gained them media &amp; MTV attention, as the video was a highlighted target on MTV's Beavis &amp; Butt-head. Chocolate and Cheese followed in 1994, heralding 70s pop/rock &amp; soul sendups such as ""Freedom of '76"" and ""Voodoo Lady"". The ""Freedom of '76"" music video was directed by Spike Jonze. At this time, Ween began to expand their live and studio line-up, providing both a crisper production sound in the studio and an easier live setup (up until this time, Ween had been using DAT tapes to provide backings for their songs).

&gt; Ween turned to Nashville studio musicians for the recording of the authentically-spirited 12 Golden Country Greats (1996) which only contained ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album. The first is that it refers to the dozen veteran Nashville studio musicians who played on the album. The second is that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album, but upon the removal of the tracks ""I Got No Darkside"" and ""So Long, Jerry"" (the latter of which was a B-side on the ""Piss Up A Rope"" single) they decided not to rename it.

&gt; The nautically-themed The Mollusk followed in 1997, demonstrating Ween's satirization, deconstruction, and appreciative mastery of genres including 1960's Brit-pop, sea shanties, Broadway show tunes, and especially progressive rock. Their desire to pursue alternate forms of media led to the MP3-only release Craters of the Sac (1999), presented by Dean for online download and free trade. Elektra Records released a live compilation entitled Paintin' The Town Brown: Ween Live 1990-1998 in 1999, followed by White Pepper (2000), their pop-themed album and final studio set for Elektra. The track ""Even If You Don't"" was made into a music video directed by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Shortly after White Pepper Ween started the internet radiostation WeenRadio, which was awarded 3rd best internet music site by Rolling Stone.[1]

&gt; Ween also formed their own label at this time, Chocodog Records, which oversaw the release of several self-produced live sets. The aforementioned Paintin' the Town Brown, which was compiled and mastered by the band, was meant to be the first Chocodog release. According to Dean Ween, once the album was completed, Elektra realized the sales potential of the CD and denied Ween the right to release it through Chocodog. Later, Ween released the first official Chocodog album, Live in Toronto (a live recording from the 1996 tour, in which Ween performed with Bobby Ogdin &amp; The Shit Creek Boys). The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases (Live at Stubb's and All Request Live) were produced in higher volumes to meet demand. In 2005, the label released the first instalment of a rarity compilation series entitled Shinola, and announced plans to re-release the 1987 cassette tape by Gene, Synthetic Socks.

&gt; The two signed to Sanctuary Records in 2003 and released Quebec, their first studio set in 3 years. In 2004, they released Live in Chicago, a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from three energetic live performances.

&gt; In February of 2006, they rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them, and, with Andrew Weiss as producer, re-recorded album versions. As of March 2007, they are recording final versions of what they have said to be about 20 songs. On May 22, 2007 they announced they will be releasing an EP entitled ""The Friends EP"" on June 8th. Dean Ween said the EP will be ""The ultimate party record, filled with good beats and good times. Perfect for your barbecue or doing bong hits or whatever it is that you guys do."" And also they announced the new album--entitled ""La Cucaracha""-- was released October 23, 2007 on Rounder Records, placing them on the same label as fellow Alternative Rock duo They Might Be Giants.

&gt; Ween came to an end in May of 2012 when Freeman announced the band had split to Rolling Stone Magazine.

&gt; In 2015 the band announced a series of reunion shows, starting with a three night stand in Colorado. In keeping with the prophecy, Boognish rose again.

&gt; La Dispute, formed in 2004, is five close friends from Grand Rapids, Michigan with a firm passion for the concept of music and art as a medium for making new friends. As a result, La Dispute makes (or strives to make) music that is both artistically, technically, and emotionally engaging in hopes of establishing legitimate connections with any and all interested people, while encouraging dialogue between those people and themselves about things in life that truly matter and that truly last. La Dispute also carries a firm passion for the relevance of a live show, both for the bands involved and for the people in attendance, and will go to the grave believing that the environment created when strangers come together despite their differences to celebrate one important thing is invaluable and should not under any circumstances be taken for granted.

&gt; Their first LP,Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released November 11, 2008. The album was recorded at Studiotte in Grand Rapids by Joel and Troy Otte.

8923,"&gt; Swedish minority means that you have a group, in Finland, who feel ""Swedish"". 

This is actually the case for some in the Swedish-speaking minority. There's [a range of views among them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish-speaking_population_of_Finland#Identity) from identifying as Finns to identifying as a distinct ethnicity within Finland to identifying as Swedes.
&gt;According to a sociological study published in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry.[Note 24] However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the Swedish People's Party, has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an opposite view is still that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, östsvenskar or ""East Swedes"".

Case in point, [this](https://www.svd.se/finlandssvenskar-ar-svenskar) article by a Swedish-speaking Finnish author appealing to the ""mother country"" to help preserve the Swedish language in Finland:
&gt;It is also about identity. When I come to Sweden and people call me a Finn [finne], it is a violation of my identity. I am just as Swedish as any Swede from Sweden [rikssvensk, or ""Swedish Swede""]. Swedish is my native language and part of my identity and culture. We Finland-Swedes are not Finns, but Swedes.

The only way it would be otherwise is if there were a rapid reversal on the side of the settler movement.  But that is not going to happen.  Israel and the West Bank will merge, and Israel will lose its Jewish character as it exists today.

No racism involved.  Just geopolitical realism.

&gt;Consistent with the authors' predictions, age differences in sensation seeking, which are linked to pubertal maturation, follow a curvilinear pattern, with sensation seeking increasing between 10 and 15 and declining or remaining stable thereafter. In contrast, age differences in impulsivity, which are unrelated to puberty, follow a linear pattern, with impulsivity declining steadily from age 10 on.

The Ravens went from 4th in the league in redzone attempts per game to 25th, and it's not because of Flacco's play as both his comp% and TO% are the same or better than in the past.

I'm not actually saying Froggen is better than Jensen, just deconstructing your argument that it's because of game losses that Jensens dpm is low. Jensen is funneled the most gold post 15 by his team out of any midlaner in the LCS (Oracles Elixir) and his most played champs are relatively high in the avg DPM department (Taliyah, Ori, Syndra). Bjergsen is doing more with less, there isn't really a coutnerargument for this one.

But by far the most chilling tale was from when he was working in a very secluded area of wilderness and was walking through the forest when a thunderstorm hit. He had seen a opening in the hill a little while back and headed to it to take shelter. Once inside he shined his flashlight to check he wasn't going to wake up a bear or something and found the skeleton of a man, sitting in a lawn chair, with a rifle rigged up so he had been able to shoot himself. The skeleton was still wearing jeans and a flannel shirt.

People weren't pretending. LeBron was better but Wade was a top 5 player in his own right(probably top 3) .  The hype and expectations surrounding the Heat during that initial summer were very similar to the hype surrounding Golden State when they signed Durant(as in a top 5 player joining another top 5 player in their prime during FA). 
 
The thing is, absolutely no one expected Wade to decline as rapidly as he did following 2011. And you are absolutely right that this in fact did help LeBron's legacy because after that year, there was no longer any doubt as to whose team it was - hence him not really getting as much hate for playing with Miami as he did at the time of the decision. 

If Curry suddenly began to decline next season and Golden State officially became Durant's team, that wouldn't make people retroactively incorrect about questioning whose team it was from the initial signing up until now. ",nba

&gt; Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972),  better known by his stage name Eminem/Slim Shady is an American rapper and record producer.  Eminem learned his trade while growing up in Detroit, United States, and quickly gained popularity in 1999 with his major-label album, The Slim Shady LP, which won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. The following album, The Marshall Mathers LP, became the fastest-selling solo album in the United States history.

In 2002, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for Lose Yourself from the film, 8 Mile, in which he also played the lead. Lose Yourself would go on to become the longest running #1 hip-hop single.

In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart

&gt; On November 10, 2013, Eminem won the Global Icon award at the 2013 MTV EMA Music Awards.

9242,"I know you are convinced, and you even say you are sure everyone in the world will see it the same way you do. That is one thing I can absolutely say it won't happen, never expect everyone to agree with you. Not even if you have the facts by your side. And in this case, the fact are:

- Polls says that pro-independence voters will have a higher turnout that pro-union votes.

- Multiple pro-union voters says they won't vote in a referendum not sanctioned by the state.

- Abstention will be more than high enough to sway any potential result.

With those facts, it is not possible to infer the real support based on the referendum results. Do not confuse a referendum result with reality, they are not the same. Context needs to be taken into place, and in this situation, context is tricky. Let me try to explain this, and I will put what I think it may be actually a real result:

- One day before the referendum, a poll is done to measure the support. Result is 45% yes, 45 no, 10 don't know/won't answer.

- Referendum is done, result is 70% yes and 30% no with a 64% turnout.

- One day after the referendum, a poll is done again. Results are once again 45% yes, 45% no, 10 don't know/won't answer

According to you, the referendum represents the real support. Are those two polls wrong? By a 25%? Are the polls right and hundreds of thousands of people changed their mind the day of the referendum and changed it back the next day? If you assume the referendum result is fixed and represent reality, you can't properly explain what is going on.

But in reality, when you check the numbers, 45% of 5 million votes (random number) is 2.25 million. 70% of the 64% of 5 million is 2.24 million, barely any change. So what is the real support? 70%? 45%? That is a 25% difference. It is way easier to explain the numbers taking into account voters that in the polls say they are against but in the referendum they abstain. Specially when you have that same people announcing in advance they won't vote because they don't consider the referendum legitimate. Occam's Razor.

So the point of discussion shifts. Is it reasonable to consider that some voters don't see the referendum as legitimate? You may not agree, but most of the world will. Today, Spain is considered the sovereign entity that applies to Catalonia, and it has formally stated it does not consider the referendum valid. So the final question is:

- Is the international community willing to accept that a referendum carried over without the approval of the current sovereign entity is legitimate enough so abstentions have to be accepted as people renouncing to their right to vote instead of people rejecting the validity of the vote itself?

Accepting that principle opens a shit-storm. Who has the ultimate authority to make those referendums.

Let's consider recent referendums. I will ignore South Sudan, as Khartum agreed to the vote (there was more than 95% turnout and more than 95% support though). So we have Kosovo. Kosovo is a similar situation, it was not a vote held by the sovereign country, and actually, some of the population (Serbs) rejected to vote. However, when checking the results, you don't have the same uncertainty than in your case:

&gt; Over 99% of voters voted in favour of independence, with a turnout of 87%. The referendum was boycotted by Serbs living in the region, who comprised around 10% of the population

Even if every single Serb that boycotted the referendum vote against, even if you include any abstention as a no vote, the *for* won by a landslide. And even today, Kosovo is not fully recognise by the international community.

9278,"Nearly *every* movie treats its subject matter as a commodity to some degree, the exploitation ""genre"" is just more brazen about it because that's the whole point of it.

It's *supposed* to appeal to the lowest common denominator and just be stylish and entertaining in the cheapest possible way, not at all unlike the gangster pictures of the 30s, the scifi B-movies of the 50s, the vixen road movies of the 60s and the schlock &amp; slasher horror of the 70s and 80s. Difference is, blaxploitation is ultimately a specific type of exploitation made for entertainment for a specific audience, made by specific people. As such, it can only be considered empowering, since they refuse to bow to social standards. Even if it is a form of cultural segregation, it is self-imposed by the people themselves since black audiences flocked to see those films. If blaxploitation films revived today get a broader audience, great, but they won't reinforce any other sense of ""otherness"" than is already present in the audience if they don't. There are plenty of other types of cultural segregation, to be sure, like the gentrification and stratification of city planning, but all blaxploitation did was exploit a previously untouched market. It never aimed to segregate or provide some kind of social schism, it only meant to entertain those who found themselves underrepresented in film, no different than any niche audience.

For someone so quick to dismiss the genre as racist, you're subject to quite a bit of historical revisionism yourself. Blaxploitation was always explicitly geared at black audiences and by and large made by black filmmakers. Studios started backing some and tried to copy their success after the fact, yes, but were largely unsuccessful (the only studio-led ""blaxploitation-inspired"" film that was a genuine hit is to my knowledge Live and Let Die). Toward the end of the era, the blaxploitation novelty had worn off as the disco age came about, but even as black filmmakers stopped making blaxploitation films, the few white directors that took up the mantle weren't studio shills or part of any deliberate effort of anyone to water the genre down or sell it to whites. They were B-movie directors trying to make a quick buck for themselves, working either independently or for companies like AIP who didn't give a shit about content or audience as long as it made money. And if you look at the films, they're virtually indistinguishable from the blaxploitation films directed by black filmmakers - and very deliberately so. If you want to cash in on another movie's audience, you do your best to copy it. There were a few exceptions of course, but none of those were particularly successful or entered into the public discourse the way the earlier films were. There's a reason why the genre died out - black people weren't watching it anymore and whites never really were.

And the studios didn't cheapen anything. Black filmmakers did that themselves. They were originally inspired by social criticism and all, but don't kid yourself - the first of the black wave movies were still hugely exploitative because that's what they thought they had to do in order to earn money, particularly when black filmmakers actually started to go behind the camera instead of just in front. Bear in mind that both Night of the Living Dead and Putney Swope were made by white filmmakers, while the genre you're so quick to dismiss was primarily made by black filmmakers.

They threw in some violence and gratuitous nudity to put more butts in the seats, that's all. Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song was one of the first big black wave hits and was absolute trash, mostly on purpose. The studios bankrolled Shaft, sure, but it still remained a uniquely Gordon Parks-led movie. And even so, the primary audience remained black Americans and the filmmakers remained black. Every last movie of the main blaxploitation phase was made by black directors and any effort to copy those successes failed miserably. The blaxploitation genre died out because 

There is definitely a propagation of a media stereotype of black people among white audiences, but that's not born out of blaxploitation culture. That's born out of the post-modernist backlash/parody to social criticism movies like In the Heat of the Night, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Blackboard Jungle. Those movies were far more successful with white audiences and eventually led to the late 80s/90s revival of mainstream movies tackling racism and gang culture among black people (along with the explosion of hiphop and rap music) like Do The Right Thing, Boyz N the Hood, Menace 2 Society etc. *Those* are the movies that started whatever black stereotypes there are in cinema today, along with deliberate efforts of diversity in mainstream television, like the Cosby Show, Fresh Prince, Benson, Family Matters etc. None of those made any effort to copy the blaxploitation genre at all.

I dare you to find a single average white person today who's actually seen Superfly, Coffy, Cleopatra Jones or even the original Shaft. I doubt you'd even find anyone who could tell you what a blaxploitation movie *looks like* outside of cineasts.

If they're going to revive the blaxploitation genre, I'm completely down with that, because what it represents still doesn't correspond in the slightest to the mainstream media stereotype of black people. Yes, they depict violence and crime while starring black people, but it's really no different than the Hollywood mainstream action-crime genre in the first place. Are we supposed to associate white people with violence now too? Correlation isn't causation, and I think any discerning viewer old enough to watch these films can understand that.

The visuals, music and style of blaxploitation is pretty much otherwise nonexistent in mainstream media and culture depictions of black people. In fact, the only reminder I've seen in the past 2 decades of Hollywood films of the genre is when they featured the Superfly soundtrack in Captain America The Winter Soldier. That's how far removed those films are from mainstream American culture, and exactly as far removed it is from those negative stereotypes you're afraid they will reinforce.

Today we're in a different climate than the one you describe. Ethnicities of all kinds are becoming so integrated into every movie, into every TV show that it's gone beyond tokenism and pushed us into a broader diversification discourse where the new battlefield has been moved to gender issues instead. There still exists racism to be sure, but for the past year it's been taking on an overt backlash form *against* the entertainment industry diversifying, not something propagated by it. Black culture itself is becoming so mainstream that it's virtually indistinguishable from American culture at large, precisely *because* of the entertainment industry. R&amp;B is the biggest genre there is now and is appropriated by whites, latinos, even asians. Meanwhile, tons of movies and TV shows askew typical portrayals of black characters as entrenched in their own subculture. Most black characters in film and TV today could easily be switched out with white actors and vice versa and it would hardly make a difference, that's how integrated we've all become.",movies

I know so many people who will aggressively express their distaste for our national team because of the shady dealings of our FA yet will support their germanys and their netherlands.

9283,"Right so our goal in gearing is to get between 40%-50% haste with the bone shield buff. It's completely up to you where you stop stacking haste. At around 40% it is not longer our best stat it ends up being tied with Vers until about 50% where vers overtakes haste.

As for mastery. There are a lot of things affecting this. So I'll try to go through them all and explain why. 

One reason is that Death Strike costs RP instead of runes now. So the faster we generate runes the faster we can generate RP and the more we can death strike so more healing and therefore more shield. 

Another issue is that our mastery scaling is completely garbage in this expansion. In previous expansions we heal'd for more and more of that healing was converted into a shield. IIRC it used to be 50% of the healing you did baseline.

One last issue is that bosses melee for a lot more of our HP for some reason. Meaning it's harder to build up a decent blood shield. Back in HFC Archimonde max hit me for like 450k and I had around 800k health. In Legion bosses like Demonic inquisition randomly max hit me for 5 mil+ and I'm sat at 7mil HP. 


A funny thing about this is that originally our Unending Thirst talent worked like this. When your blood shield expires you heal for 50% of your missing HP and explode dealing damage to enemies around you equal to the health you heal'd. 

The current iteration of our mastery feels like they designed Blood DK's to work with this trait. They then removed the trait but didn't fix our mastery scaling. It would explain why BDK were so weak for so long. Aside from Blizzard being incompetent.

TL;DR Our mastery starts off at a low baseline, it has crappy scaling. Shields generated are too small and get removed instantly by boss melee hits.",wow

9285,"1. Games are won by teams coordinating ganks/roams/TP advantage in the botlane because first tower gold, and botlane's tier 1 turret is weaker than other tier 1 turrets. Then they rotate and switch to top lane in an effort to secure towers as well. 

2. Most ADCs don't built too much crit as of lately with a few exceptions. The majority use on-hit items,  and items like deaths dance(which is broke) since they are a cheaper powerspike and are great against tanks. 

3. Mages are not weak at all. In fact control mages and burst mages are extremely strong right now that many of them such as Orianna, Syndra, and Taliyah are getting nerfs. Plus mages have very good itemization that can also counter tanks, with the only AD items noticeably better is giant slayer or executioner. 

4. Knight's Vow and Ardent censer is exactly why supports are a stronger role right now. They are the ones responsible for the increase in an AD's power/sustainability, and putting an AD in a higher light for another role's job is just unfair to the support role as that is they're contribution. ADCs now are highly dependent on play making or enchanter supports which is why Braum, thresh, and Janna are extremely good picks right now.

I'm around since S1 (playing on my brother account) and long ago i was thinking ""it's normal, riot games is a little company""

also why are fixes never ""vrey precise"" an exemple of what i mean by precise: withdrawing 1 lethality at the time on all the range of lethality items cause well, we know those items are either built together (that's when they work best if i remember correctly, lethality/pene is only efficient when you have a good amount of it) or not at all

also consider giving ryze a mana stacking like (veigar and nasus but on mana), i think it wouldn't be hard to balance him afterward &lt;3

The pastor's speech is what really tied the movie's theme together for me.

My interpretation is that the movie is Caiden realizing that the seemingly pointless minutia of his life are what really ""make"" it.  His ex-wife's paintings are an allusion to this concept.

The fact that the girl's house is constantly burning down, but she doesn't notice, is a giant blinking (burning, ha) enforcement to this concept.

There is a scene where Caiden is trying to explain to the actor an *entire* backstory that is all leading up to 5 seconds of him walking across stage.

And how he keeps making the set more and more and more and more intricate.

9487,"&gt; MLS/American model only leads to mediocrity/complete shit

Bullshit. 

The salary cap and team stability encourage owners to invest and develop. 

Aside from the super clubs, European leagues are filled with mediocrities that have no chance of excelling. The stay in the same few spots in the league table season after season. They can't afford to buy good players. They are often forced to sell their best players. And they buy the players they need at inflated prices and keep them long enough so they aren't relegated. 

Coaches are not given a chance to develop players or team chemistry. The stakes are so high that even good coaches with a run of bad luck are fired by panicked owners. 

Fresh ideas are too risky and might get the team relegated, so forget about innovation. 

Stability leads to quality. Only a few super clubs in Europe have the stability to develop (and buy) that quality. And they have to pay through the nose for it. 

So as a result we get lopsided leagues where most of the outcomes are pretty much a given. 

MLS, on the other hand,does not have super clubs like Manchester United, but it does offer an unpredictable season, more real competition, and more balance top to bottom. ",soccer

Are there any side effects you are still currently dealing with even with your now improved sleep? Right now even on days I do sleep I find that there are some persistent problems, and I wonder how long these may actually last.

1) people will care about mmr 

This means counters will be in play along with teamwork, communication and effort as opposed to awe in the face of the man who tells 76 ""dva calls me daddy too"" 

2) the damage and mobility is linked.

I've done the math with some aproximation of firerate and his primary fire is total garbage. Outside of unloading a fully loaded gun (165dps if the fire rate is approximately 1 per .4 seconds or 2.5 a second)  the continued fire as it regens is trash (~94.38 dps with the regen/fire time being .7) and his full reload time is 2.8 seconds to make his gun worth a damn again. 

It by no means needs a buff but still something to consider. It's only a little better than a support weapon (mercy 80 dps)

If he uses a heavy hitting combo on a tank to take them down he gains 90 hp  (30 per ability per person hit, 3 abilities) but he has no mobility unless you want to use meteor strike to escape.

The remaining number should be the amount of times you need to recharge. If each location recharged at charges at the pace of an hour for a full charge from 1/4 charge, then the math is rather simple at that point. 

I imagine without running the numbers that you are probably going to have to recharge about 3 to 5 times max depending on the route, the traffic conditions and the actual range of your vehicle. So your 18 hour trip might rise to something like a 23 hour trip to be frank, but is that really so bad?

You will probably answer yes, but in time the range will increase as our battery tech gets better. It already is. Slowly. It's just a matter of time now.

9791,"lol wut... have you heard of this thing called hemp?

Its quite useful, and poses a huge threat to vested corporate interests. In fact, hemp was once the largest and most important industry in the United States, even before the US was a country. 

Facts:

The first 2 copies of the Declaration of Independence are on hemp paper, a paper which proves to be superior in nearly every way to tree pulp based paper.

Ethanol from hemp is far more carbon efficient than corn based biofuel, plastics from hemp are biodegradable and stronger than petroleum based products. In fact, [this](http://hempcar.org/ford.shtml).

Hemp seeds contain lots of amino acids and vitamins and are considered a ""superfood"".

Cordage and fabric from hemp are much more durable than their cotton counterparts.

Cultivation of hemp has lasted as long as human civilization and it is one of the most useful and important crops we have. However, it is profitable to some corporate interests to have weed be illegal, every industry where hemp has a potential application as a competitor product will fight to keep it illegal because such a transition would be expensive and destabilize the market. 

Inform yourself, lest you misinform those who, unlike you, would support the cause.

He'd be stupid to defy a country with such sums of money, and they would probably freeze his Qatari account until the deal is done, making payments to Barcelona on Neymar's behalf, from that account.

If FIFA asks, Qatar (since the royal family owns PSG) can just give a ""public version"" of the contract which removes links to PSG. FIFA can't do much more after that as Qatar will say that the public contract is the actual contract.

&gt; Grouplove is an indie pop band which formed in 2009 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Hannah Hooper (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Wessen (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums). The band released their debut album, Never Trust a Happy Song, in September 2011, which was followed by Spreading Rumours, released September 2013. Both albums were produced by the band's drummer Ryan Rabin, who is the son of former Yes guitarist and film composer Trevor Rabin.

&gt; Hannah Hooper met Christian Zucconi late one evening on the lower east side of Manhattan. They had both been living in New York for years and had never crossed paths before. But from that night forward the two could hardly be pulled apart. Soon after their connection, Hooper was invited to an art residency in Greece on the island of Crete and Hooper insists ""without any hesitation"" she invited Zucconi to join her on this journey. ""Seriously, we had only known one another for a few days but are both so inspired and alive when we are together that going to Greece seemed like a magical and natural thing to do,"" recalls Zucconi.

&gt; On Crete, in a small remote mountain village, Hooper and Zucconi met the members of their future band ""GROUPLOVE"" a year before it was officially formed. Sean Gadd, a natural songwriter and guitar player, born and bred in London instantly bonded with the two eccentric New Yorkers. Their relationship became apparent through the music they were making day in and day out. Andrew Wessen, a pro surfer and musician from Los Angeles and his childhood friend Ryan Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, were also at the residency and quickly joined in with the musical trio. These five musicians make up the members of what we now know as GROUPLOVE .

&gt; Like all good things, the summer and the residency came to an end and the five friends scattered back to their homes all over the globe. With Sean in London, Christian and Hannah in Brooklyn and Ryan and Andrew in Los Angeles GROUPLOVE was faced with the challenge of what to do now. ""We all understood how rare it is for five strangers to feel as close as family and create passionate music together. We couldn't just return to Brooklyn and let the music we all made fade into a memory of that summer we had in Greece,"" explains Zucconi. Everyone pulled their funds together and Sean, Christian and Hannah made their way to Ryan Rabin's studio in LA to record their album. ""We seriously had the best time of our lives doing that record,"" says Gadd. And the result is an incredibly special album where soaring harmonies coupled with sweeping anthems lead you through their powerful journey. Like the members of GROUPLOVE, their music is diverse in influence and style but bonded together by an undeniably creative kinship.

&gt; Their experience back together and recording together was so potent that Hooper and Zucconi packed up their lives in Brooklyn and Gadd packed up his life in London and they all moved to LA to live and play their music.

&gt; ""We never could have dreamt this up,"" says Zucconi, ""but at the same time we're not at all surprised - GROUPLOVE is meant to be. Our story a testament to fate, and our music is something we are ready to share."" Read more on Last.fm.

In the time I spend teaching you any of the legitimate value add tasks I could have done it myself 4x over. 

And there's little point in ""grunt work"" anymore - we've automated 90% of those work processes. Even if there was a point, I always want interns/juniors to grow personally. And you don't get to do that if you spend 95% of your time just cleaning/checking data or pitchbooks.

It's a very rare intern that's any use at all at the end of their 3mo. Hell, even most juniors take a year to be legitimately useful. That said, we do pay our interns okay (something like 4k/mo IIRC), and I do think people should be compensated for their time. But in terms of value, subtract the time I and others spend teaching/mentoring though, and we spend probably $10k/mo per intern. Do you think an intern provides $10k/mo of value?

That's not what they said at all, that's your own interpretation to fit your point. [They want a kiss instead of an attempt, ](/s ""they'll get a kiss in the next couple episodes, no blue balls""). Proper kiss =/= french kiss.

So take the time and write out your issue. It's worth noting that the article is about cell phone plans not internet but you and everyone else should take the time to complain about each element.       

If the CRTC releases their yearly complaint numbers and they go down each year it won't get much media coverage. If all of a sudden the numbers go up by 30-50% in one year imagine how much media coverage that will get?      
   
Look at the numbers from last year:    

Top 10 service providers by number of complaints

1. Bell Canada – 2,940 complaints – down 18.3 per cent year over year   
2. Rogers – 861 complaints – down 52.5 per cent   
3. Telus – 570 complaints – up 22.3 per cent   
4. Wind – 498 complaints – down 29.1 per cent   
5. Virgin Mobile – 497 complaints – down 18.3 per cent   
6. Fido – 453 complaints – down 25.4 per cent   
7. Videotron – 402 complaints – up 28.4 per cent   
8. Koodo – 207 complaints – up 18.3 per cent   
9. Xplornet – 188 complaints – up 86.1 per cent    
10. Comwave – 160 complaints – up 11.9 per cent    

Look at the numbers for just Rogers and Bell alone, there are more complaints in this thread than there are via the CRTC for all of last year.     

It's not a great system but its the only one we got and we don't make use of it.

10222,"On some level, I think he wanted a 'climactic' duel with Jon at that point. His belated agreeement of Jon's challenging him to single combat wasn't necessarily just mockery on Ramsay's part, but he might have felt that he could achieve a moral victory of sorts if he were to fight Jon one-on-one, even though he would almost certainly lose that match-up.

Ramsay's final conversation with Sansa suggests that the prospect of fame was something he concerned himself with. He's effectively resigned  to the likelihood that he was probably never going to leave that cell alive, but taunts Sansa by insisting that he is a 'part of [her] now' that even in victory she will never truly be able to forget. Sansa counters with a taunt of her own, telling Ramsay that both she and history will forget him.

Finishing a giant shortly before dueling Jon was about as impressive a legacy as he could hope for at that point. I'm sure he also knew that even if he did kill Jon, it would make little if any difference. His army was completely decimated, and Sansa was well-positioned to assume Jon's leadership role had he been killed that day.

So I imagine that Ramsay thought dueling Jon--win or lose--would be remembered more favorably than his 'cheaply' killing Jon when the opportunity presented itself. He wasn't going to live to the end of that day no matter what happened.",gameofthrones

10403,"Do you think having a mode that limited the players' hero choices would be less frustrating? That way you won't have to solo heal the Hanzo/Widow/Genji. 

That's how I feel anyway, and I think there are at least 3 ways Blizzard could do it. 

1. Mystery Heroes that nudges the team towards a 2-2-2. This was recently discussed by Jeff on the Overwatch forums so it seems within the realm of possibility. 

2. Quick Play except you can only lock 2-3 DPS maximum. Just like when someone has already locked Genji and now he's not selectable, if your teammates win the ""instalock a DPS"" race you will not be selecting a DPS this game. Having to race for the role you want to play might feel bad sometimes, but it would be better than the last person to pick always going Hanzo even though we have no healers. 

3. A mode where you queue as a role (healer/tank/DPS) and the matchmaking tries to assemble a passable team composition.  If you need to change heroes for countering reasons you can still do that, but you can only flex within your chosen role.  This would probably be the hardest to code which is why it isn't my first suggestion, but I know nothing. 

There are downsides to all of these ideas but it's better than what we have now.  It's really frustrating to see people treat Quick Play like it's Call of Duty and focus exclusively on getting those sick frags. There can be a mode for that too, but I don't want to play it.

When all the characters start the same, it tends to go off in the same direction.

Realistically, it's not really the same thread of development, but when most stories star a teenage boy with limited magical capability who's secretly a badass, without any realistic parental figure, and an enemy that must be, eventually conquered and limited sense of self-worth, it sorta kinda goes off in the same direction every time, or, at least, feels like it.

I'm not to hot on the idea of beginner anime in general, you don't have beginner Hollywood films or beginner UK TV so why would anime be different? The only exception is obviously parodies and shows that rely on references. What I can do is talk about shows for skeptical first timers, in that case I'd say go shows that aren't full of otaku bait shit and aren't super teenager-ish. Stuff like:

- Macross plus
- Yamato 2199
- Kenshin T&amp;B
- Gits:SAC
- Shouwa Rakugo
- Cowboy Bebop
- Gundam 0080
- Wolf's Rain
- Golden Boy
- Planetes
- Captain Tylor
- Black Lagoon
- You're Under Arrest
- Hi no Tori (the various versions)
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes
- Gundam 08th MS Team
- Detroit Metal City
- Usagi Drop
- Gundam Build Fighters
- Kuroko no Basket
- Hajime no Ippo
- Riding Bean
- Gunsmith Cats
- R.O.D OVAs
- Cobra
- Cyber City Oedo

None of that stuff has the cringey teenager stuff in it, which is the most impotant thing to avoid, and neither is it stuff full of injokes and references. It also avoids the dreaded moe (not saying moe is bad, just saying maybe not best for a skeptical watcher) and otaku bait stuff, like maids and not-cest.

&gt; English:
Stracené ráj is a band from Mezice, Czech Republic (although we should say Moravia, or better Haná). From the beginning in year 1994 they're playing only their own songs. Musical styles covers from some kind of folklore and hard blues to bigbeat, rock and metal. As the band is from region called ""Haná"", all their lyrics are in ""Haná"" dialect, which makes them really unique.

&gt; 
Hanácke:
Je kapela z Mezec kósek od Olomóca. Od vzniko v roko 1994 hraje jenom pisničke z vlastni tvorbe. Ze začátko bele aji nejaky česky, ale včel ož jeno hanácke otextovany. Žánrové záběr je veleké, od najakyho folkroko přes bigbit, tvrdy blues až po metal. Tade se tamo řiká hanácké bigbit. Všechno hanácke.

&gt; Složeni kapele je:
Prvni kytara a zpěv:               Marek Veróbal
Drohá kytara a zpěv:               Karel ""Koodl"" Ošťádal
Basa a zpěv:                       Marek Ošťádal
Klávese, akordeon a zpěv:          Lukáš Mikolka
Bobne:                             Tomáš Otěkalu

&gt; Kapela za dobo své eksistence vedala dvě demo CD. První v roko 1996 s 11 pisničkama a drohy v roko 2000 se 12 pisničkama. Meze leďma se o rozšéřeni postarale hudebni piráti. V roko 2007 vešlo posledni třeti CD. Toto cédo je oficiálni cédo Stracenyho Rája. Je na něm 13 pisniček, videoklip a fotke z natáčeni ve studio

&gt; A pro jistotu i něco česky:
Skupina Stracené Ráj je hanácká kapela se vším všudy. Převážná většina písní je otextovaná v hanáčtině a její členové jsou nefalšovaní hanáci ze samého středu hané. Jediní na světě, žádný folklór, ale bigbit. Read more on Last.fm.

With a unanimous vote on the Quarantine, Marcantonio Giustinian was elected on January 26, 1684 at the age of 65. 
The house was dating back to Giustiniano's ""gens romana"" and was so rich that it could be a reigning house. 
His personal resume was completely respected: after graduating in Philosophy in Padua he had embarked on a public career with very important positions. He had been a ""biade"" administrator during the wars of Candia, ambassador to France where he received the title of knight.

The most convincing explanation is that it was a 'nondecision.'  It was expected by all the upper echelons of U.S. officials that, once developed, the bomb would be used.  Roosevelt's Hyde Park Aide Memoire seemed to assume that also.  Truman never regretted the use of these weapons to end World War II, but he was prudent about their use thereafter.""(James E.

This contest is always decided by the lurkers Holo fanbase and others like Misaka last year just want to see their favourite girl to win for once, and what happen last year is just boosting those comments. 

If we wanted a fair contest, people should be allowed to vote if they saw both shows, but that would make the contest less fun because most people wouldn´t never vote. I thought Holo would lose not because of spite votes or because she is less popular but mostly because S&amp;W is a show that while popular is too old (yeah... 2007/09 is too old I guess) and a lot of new viewers didn´t see the show yet and neither is their cup of tea compared to a comedy fantasy setting.

10685,"Gah, I had a long reply that I was working on but I accidentally hit ""home"" and killed it.  Oops.

I've been enjoying talking about this too! Always interesting to toss these ideas around!  I do agree that there is a certain appeal to human ears in, say, a melodic note on the piano that isn't necessarily there in the same way for the shrill shriek of a dog whistle.  I don't think it makes the piano note objectively ""good"" though, and I also don't think it makes it impossible for the dog whistle to show up in music.  My view of objectivity is that, in order for something to be objectively true, it must be true independently of humanity.  For instance, the fact that the moon exists is objectively true as it's there.  The fact that the moon is pretty is subjectively true.  I ultimately think that beauty and irritatingness fall way on to the subjective side in that there's no intrinsic quality of beauty attached to the sound waves of a piano note, just like there's no intrinsic quality of annoyingness attached to the dog whistle.

Dissonance and consonance combined may profoundly affect people in one way, but other types of music affect them in other ways.  For instance, ambient music may totally abandon those ideas depending on which ambient music it is.  It may still profoundly affect people, however, in that it may conjure a powerful and almost visual sense of atmosphere (like looking at a painting of a marsh, or being immersed in some bizarre, surreal world) or it may relax the listener in to an almost trance-like state, and leave them feeling refreshed and cleansed as if the music had given their brain a rejuvenating rinse and massage.

Jazz is another good example.  It strays away from tightly structured melodies and seeks to unleash the human creativity of the players.  So the chords are often sort of open, allowing for plenty of melodic freedom for the improvisers.  Jazz most definitely can have a powerful effect on listeners in that listening to jazz is like listening to creativity in its pure form; straight from the mind of the player to your mind.  Or, as a great reddit submission once put it, it's like an artistic tribute to the human mind's ability to create beauty.  

In reference to the dog whistle...I've read about this woman who makes musical compositions out of that high pitched squealing sound you get when you pinch the airhole of a balloon and let a little air deflate out.  I don't like her music, but some people think it's great abstract art and/or fun and playful.  

A less extreme example would be the dog whistle sound at the end of Sgt. Pepper.  It's certainly a harsh noise but it works within the artistic context--I think it adds to the album's overall vibe of exploring new musical ideas and challenging established ideas of music.  Another good example is the high pitched guitar ""whale song"" shrieks in Pink Floyd's ""Echoes.""  Within that musical context (backed by atmospheric, otherwordly sound effects and in the middle of a dreamy song about the ocean), they sound like some incredibly surreal, otherworldly, powerful form of poetry.  They've got nothing to do with traditional musical structure, notes, or harmony, but they certainly can have a powerful effect.

I get troubled by my own views on music sometimes.  Am I accepting a view of music that basically abandons the idea of quality standards and accepts everything?  Am I accepting the possibility of a future where some guy farts in to a tape recorder, loops it for 46 minutes, adds some scrambled sounds from an infomercial and dissonant chords, and releases it as a postmodern work of art?  

Maybe.  But I think this is where your thoughts on how the human mind reacts to sound come back in to the picture.  It's true that any sound can be music, but it doesn't mean that any sound can be music that many people will actually connect with or get any value from.  And I think it's true that the farther away an artist strays from musical tradition, the more listeners they will lose and the fewer minds will find value in what the artist is saying.  But I don't think the quality of art is defined by how many people are able to connect with it.  I think the quality of art is like the quality of food--subjective.  And each mind finds the music that speaks to it the most powerfully.  I think the fact that so many different types of music connect powerfully in so many different ways with so many people is an indication that musical quality is subjective, and it depends on what you're looking for in a musical experience.",Music

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound.

10735,"&gt; So you already came up with one of the reasons why. 

i stated the only reason and its a really shit reason. 

&gt; learning about other cultures, different points of view.

the only way to do this is to maintain national boundaries, cultures and identities and then to travel between those segregations... having a chinese neighbourhood where little italy used to be with illegible writing on billboards does nothing to teach me about chinese culture, traveling does.

also it says a lot about how much you hate western white culture since you want our nations ""mixed"" away whilst saying nothing about sending whites/black/indians to go and make china or japan multicultural. oh no we'd never hear you say that. 

funny how its ""asia for the asians, africa for the africans, europe for.... everyone?"". your racism is blatantly apparent. 

&gt;Making new friends

wow. we need to replace the white demographic with chinese/indians so that we can make new friends? you struggle that hard with making friends? I can make friends with anyone, they dont have be non whites and non western as a prerequisite. (fyi im an immigrant too)

&gt;Learning about the world. Becoming more worldly.

see above for how i destroyed this dumb argument.. having bastardized cuisine and chinese/russian millionaires ramping up the price of our property does NOTHING to teach us about the world or make us more worldly, ONLY travel does. 


&gt;Not being closed off in a bubble

ahh yes, only asia and africa gets its little bubble


&gt;And you get to help people that need help. 

oh boy here we go, who really needs help here? the collapsing western demographic, or the exploding african and middle eastern demographic? why should my dollars be used to subsidise the women that have 5 babies when I can barely afford 1?

In any event, the elephant you should start noticing right about now is that a functional majority of the US electorate is about to discover that their Hero in Chief has been under attack based on the word of James Bond. 

It's a majority that has nucleated around ~xenophobia but currently encompasses a pretty broad cross section of American society. The most radical of them have spent the last seven months poring over the WikiLeaks, stocking their bunkers with fact-based nonsense that will make PizzaGate look tame, and developing a guerilla media strategy that's light years ahead of the antiquated bullshit that lost the last election for the Dems.

This is no more than the Dems deserve. As a Green--which is a dissident populist progressive party in USA--I have no particular love for either of them anyway: both sides are consumerists. I'm fine with Trump having won because he's a bigger fuck up than Hillary and will do less actual damage to the country. If Obama had surrendered on his lame-duck TPP plan--that particular variety of consolidating power is well and truly over in this land--I'd have probably backed her ... right up until the WikiLeaks started dropping.

The Khadr family in Canada, *with whom Mr Khadr still lives with in Edmonton*, have continued to make statements in line with fundamentalist Islam and have called for jihad/death of infidels.

10972,"""You say you don't know what the plan is, but that one of your first questions was ""What is the purpose of the Universe""""

Well, that was a difficult thing for me to accept in the beginning. See I know the purpose of our Universe. I don't know the plan for all universes. I know what the basic plan is, but not every detail. The creator apparently has discovered many interesting things outside of our universe that apparently could help our universe in some way. I didn't ask much about the other universes to be honest because I was sad. Why doesn't and why hasn't the creator contacted any humans like it used to do back in the day? Because it burnt the fuck out on us for a while. Seriously bummed the shit outta me. Literally our ancestors drove the creator entity to such frustration that it left. So that's about as deep as I got regarding the bigger picture. At that point I may have actually been crying. So I turned my questions back to our Universe in particular.

""You say the creator is a one of a kind and is trying to understand what they are ""and much more"". What if the ""much more"" was that the creator is trying to recreate the circumstances of it's own creation?""

You know what. Before I answer that question I would just like to say one thing. Whoever you are I like you. Because you are apparently smarter than me. That is exactly what it was trying to do with our universe. At this point though so no one else gets sad like I did, yes the entity has returned its attention back to this universe. 

""Not just trying to understand itself, I mean the goal was to figure out how to make another like itself. It would be lonely being the only one of your kind, wouldn't it?""

That is precisely what it tried in the beginning. It said the first thing that drove it to creating other entities was out of loneliness. It has only snowballed from there. To the point it is trying to figure out what/how/why/for what purpose was it created? If that entity created all that we know...wouldn't you want to attempt to figure out what created the creator? I do. Though a hilarious thought I had the other day. What if it is creators all the way down just trying to figure shit out in their own universe created by another. Rinse and repeat forever.",conspiracy
10973,"Stop chasing money like it is the key to happiness. That sort of value was chimed over and over again by my father who is a very successful business man. His story is pretty cautionary because although he was successful he basically missed out on life because of his business obligations and his desire to make more money. 

It's pretty sad. I didn't even get to know the man until my late teens. He was just kind of this guy who slept in my house, he was always working and we just didn't know each other at all. This was always  one of his regrets, but further more he has always been in this trap of chasing money like a carrot tied to a stick. He is in his late 50s now and still works and carries all these responsibilities and the physical and mental toll has ruined him. He basically wasted his life accumulating money and never able to enjoy what that money afforded him he has all these things that just sit unused like a boat, motorcycle, summer home, etc.. 

When I was older and about to go out on my own he basically begged me not to get stuck in a cycle or chase money like it the only goal in life. He would suggest setting the bar for the middle of the road and enjoying life because missing out because of work or being consumed by financial prowess is debilitating. 

By all means save. But no need to just give up and hope for a good life later because there is no telling how your life will be in the future. It would suck for you to give up on life now for a life in the future that never comes due to bad luck, illness, etc. My suggestion is to seek happiness,  and by all means save but don't put your life on hold.

By now they should've learned how to play one DPS, one tank and one support to keep everything balanced in case the team needs to be switched up. By being local Mercy OTP Number 128 against a team that just hunts you 24/7, you're forcing your entire team to play around you to keep you alive just because you decided that focusing on one character was more important than learing DPS/Tank/Support on a decent level.

I dislike the flaming when it happens but my pity for OTPs has run on thin ice during Season 5, Season 4 didn't have as many of them. It's just frustrating by now.

11076,"This is what they are trying to change: ""SEC. 224. [47 U.S.C. 224] REGULATION OF POLE ATTACHMENTS.
(a) As used in this section:
(1) The term ''utility'' means any person who is a local exchange carrier or
an electric, gas, water, steam, or other public utility, and who owns or controls
poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way used, in whole or in part, for any wire
communications. Such term does not include any railroad, any person who is
cooperatively organized, or any person owned by the Federal Government or any
State.
(2) The term ''Federal Government'' means the Government of the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.
(3) The term ''State'' means any State, territory, or possession of the United
States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality thereof.
(4) The term ''pole attachment'' means any attachment by a cable television
system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole, duct, conduit, or
right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility.
(5) For purposes of this section, the term ''telecommunications
carrier'' (as defined in section 3 of this Act) does not include any incumbent
local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h).
(b)(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the
Commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to
provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable, and shall
adopt procedures necessary and appropriate to hear and resolve complaints
concerning such rates, terms, and conditions. For purposes of enforcing any
determinations resulting from complaint procedures established pursuant to this
subsection, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate and
necessary, including issuing cease and desist orders, as authorized by section
312(b) of title III of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
(2) The Commission shall prescribe by rule regulations to carry out the
provisions of this section.
(c)(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to, or to give the
Commission jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms, and conditions, or access to
poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f), for pole
attachments in any case where such matters are regulated by a State.
(2) Each State which regulates the rates, terms, and conditions for pole
attachments shall certify to the Commission that--
Communications Act of 1934
60
(A) it regulates such rates, terms, and conditions; and
(B) in so regulating such rates, terms, and conditions, the State has
the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the subscribers
of the services offered via such attachments, as well as the interests of the
consumers of the utility services.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, a State shall not be considered to
regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments--
(A) unless the State has issued and made effective rules and
regulations implementing the State's regulatory authority over pole
attachments; and
(B) with respect to any individual matter, unless the State takes
final action on a complaint regarding such matter--
(i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the
State, or
(ii) within the applicable period prescribed for such final
action in such rules and regulations of the State, if the prescribed
period does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such
complaint.
(d)(1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is just and
reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of
providing pole attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying
the percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or
conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of the
operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire
pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.
(2) As used in this subsection, the term ''usable space'' means the space
above the minimum grade level which can be used for the attachment of wires,
cables, and associated equipment.
(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a
cable television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective date of
the regulations required under subsection (e), this subsection shall also apply to the
rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any telecommunications
carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) to
provide any telecommunications service. 
(e)(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after the date of
enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, prescribe regulations in
accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole attachments used
by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the
parties fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure
that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for pole
attachments. 
(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct,
Communications Act of 1934
61
conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such
apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing space other than the
usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment
of such costs among all attaching entities.
(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space among all
entities according to the percentage of usable space required for each entity. 
(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become effective 5
years after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Any
increase in the rates for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the
regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual increments
over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations. 
(f)(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any
telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct,
conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service may
deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its
poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory basis where there
is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and generally applicable
engineering purposes.
(g) A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications services
or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such services (and charge
any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such
services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which such company
would be liable under this section.
(h) Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way intends to
modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way, the owner shall provide
written notification of such action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to
such conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity
to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds to or modifies its
existing attachment after receiving such notification shall bear a proportionate
share of the costs incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or
right-of-way accessible.
(i) An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-of-way
shall not be required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its
attachment, if such rearrangement or replacement is required as a result of an
additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by any
other entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way).""",conspiracy

---

summary

---

It was ok. Completely mediocre. Visually appealing. It got a few hehs and smirks out of me. It has a lot more internet humor than the trailers shown and the variety of apps in that phone is pretty wide. Whoever wrote the movie at least *knew* what the hell they were talking about with technology. Of course, outside of dialogue, the visual representation of this stuff is pretty much Wreck it Ralph. Story-wise, it's kind of like Lego movie, only less randumb (which I'm not hating, I loved Lego movie). They hop from app to app, much like Lego hops from set to set. References are made, plot is advanced. I did not like the romance too much. I felt the love between Meh and Princess to be forced and unnecessary, and the progression to the love stage went too quick (it literally took one school day). Despite the love subplot the dialogue between the three (hi-5, meh and princess) when it *wasn't* about love was pretty good. 

---

Voice Acting, Humor, Animation and Plot

---
The voice acting was great in this movie. Everyone does a good job in their respective roles and I enjoyed Patrick Stewart's limited role as the poop emoji. It's pretty clear he's there for shits and giggles. Although in the ending scene, there's a part where you can tell Hi-5's dialogue was forced in... his mouth doesn't move according to his line.

Sony's animation is always good and crisp. While pixar goes for photorealism, Dreamworks goes for atmosphere, and illumination is all around shitty, I find Sony's to be the most fluid and consistently good. Their movies may be on the bad side but the animation is never terrible.

Humor wasn't forced but not always funny - sometimes it connects into [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/8h51nGo.gif), sometimes it's eye-rolling, or sometimes it gives you a slight groan with a smirk. Occasionally a chuckle. It's hit or miss humor. 

The pacing was fine as far as I can tell. Since this took heavy inspiration from Lego Movie, it basically follows that formula. No one scene lingers on too long, the plot is predictable but never confusing. There weren't any obscenely stupid plot breaking things things where I'd be muttering wtf under my breath. There are 3 subplots. The main is for Meh, the second is for Mr. and Mrs Meh looking for Meh (and rediscovering their love), and the 3rd is the User (human) trying to impress a girl at school but failing because his phone's acting all retarded.

score 

---

**If I were to be honest on this movie as a grade test, it is a D. Barely passes.**

I didn't stand up and say **""that was fucking shit""** like when I did with Despicable Me 3, or Alien Covenant, or Baywatch. At complete face value, it's a passable film. I didn't care about the 'advertisements' - it's a fucking smartphone featuring today's popular apps. I don't care about who was involved in the film - that's for after the movie, not during. The rest of the theater loved it. Or at least didn't bash it. It was mostly kids and family, with some groups of middle schoolers and high schoolers. In fact, leaving the theater I heard a lot of people actually surprised it was decent. The parents and teenagers with their group said they thought it was going to be terrible but some parts were funny. I look at this thread and I see a 0% score... I think this is one of those movies the critics already hated before watching. Reading some of the reviews there, it's clear by the attitudes who's shitting on it for fun and who cared to review the movie. Those who cared to review will tell you the same. They'll give you 4 or 5/10s and tell you it's unoriginal or bland. And they're right. This is unoriginal. It's going to be dated. I probably wouldn't waste $10 like I did if i knew what I was in for, but I wouldn't mind paying $5 on a bargain day.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/50d8a27310b0465fb9a135005f51caca.png)  

&gt; Freddie King (September 3, 1934 – December 28, 1976), thought to have been born as Frederick Christian in Gilmer, Texas, originally recording as Freddy King, and nicknamed ""the Texas Cannonball"", was an influential African-American blues guitarist and singer. He is often mentioned as one of ""the Three Kings"" of electric blues guitar, along with Albert King and B.B. King (though he was the youngest of the three).

&gt; King's mother, Ella May King, and her brother, who both played the guitar, began teaching him to play at the age of six. He liked and imitated the music of Lightnin' Sam Hopkins and saxophonist Louis Jordan. He moved with his family from Texas to the southside of Chicago in 1950. There, at age 16 he used to sneak in to local clubs, where he heard blues music performed by the likes of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, T-Bone Walker, Elmore James, and Sonny Boy Williamson. Howlin Wolf took him under his wing (or paw), and Freddie also began jamming with Muddy Waters' sidemen, who included Eddie Taylor, Jimmy Rogers, Robert Lockwood Jr. and Little Walter.

&gt; By 1952 he had started gigged at night and working days in a steel mill (by then he had married a Texas girl, Jessie Burnett). He got occasional work as a sideman on recording sessions. Two bands that he played with during this period were the Sonny Cooper Band, and Early Payton's Blues Cats. He formed the first band of his own, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with guitarist Jimmy Lee Robinson and drummer Sonny Scott.

&gt; In 1953 he made some recordings for Parrot. In 1956 he recorded ""Country Boy"", a duet with Margaret Whitfield, and ""That's What You Think"", an uptempo blues. This was for a local label, El-Bee. Robert Lockwood Jr. appeared as a sideman on guitar.

&gt; In 1959 he met Sonny Thompson, a pianist who worked for the King/Fedreal label. In 1960, he himself signed with that label; while there he often shared songwriting credits, and participated in marathon recording sessions, with Thompson. On August 26, 1960, he recorded ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman"" and ""Hide Away"", which were to become two of his most popular tunes. His debut release for the label was ""You've Got To Love Her with Feeling"". His second release on King/Federal was ""I Love the Woman"". ""Hide Away"" was used as the B side for this disk; that tune, a 12-bar mid-tempo shuffle in E with an infectious theme in the head section, and a memorable stop-time break that featured some robust-sounding work on the bass strings, was destined to become one of his signiature numbers. It was an adaptation of a tune by Hound Dog Taylor. It was named ""Hide Away"" after a popular bar in Chicago. Strictly an instrumental -- guitar with rhythm section -- it delighted everyone by crossing over and reaching #29 on the pop chart. It was later covered by Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Canadian guitarist Jeff Healy, and likely a majority of the bar blues bands on Planet Earth. After the success of ""Hide Away"", the label, which was presided over by one Syd Nathan, got Freddie and Sonny Thompson to work on making more instrumentals. This they did, producing over 30 of them during the next five years. The following is a partial list: ""The Stumble,"" ""Low Tide,"" ""Wash Out,"" ""Sidetracked"", ""San-Ho-Zay,"" ""Heads Up,"" ""Onion Rings,"" and ""The Sad Nite Owl"". Freddie became popular with a young white audience, in Britain as well as the United States, and his playing was a major influence on the upcoming breed of rock guitarists. During this period he was touring frequently along with the big R&amp;B acts of the day such as Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, James Brown. His band included his brother Benny Turner on bass; and Tyrone Davis, who would later become known in his own right, was the driver and valet.

&gt; On the personal side, Freddie was fond, perhaps overly fond, of the Chicago night life. His official website refers to him ""Gambling til dawn in the backroom of Mike's cleaners."" His wife, now with six children, decided to move back to Texas. Once there, she called Syd Nathan and demanded that he send her some of the royalty money due to her husband. To his credit, he sent her two thousand dollars, with which she made the down payment on a house. Realising that the family were definitely not coming back to Chicago, Freddie, in the spring of 1963, himself moved back to Texas to rejoin them.

&gt; His contract with King/Federal expired in 1966. That same year, while making a series of appearances on an R&amp;B program called ""The!!!Beat"", he was noticed by Atlantic Records front man King Curtis, and in 1968 he signed with the Atlantic subsidiary, Cotillion Records. He released two records for them (see Recordings), both of which showcased his vocal talents. They were not overwhelming commercial successes; however, his first overseas tour, in 1968, was a resounding triumph, being extended from one month to three. He was ""amazed by his popularity in England.""1

&gt; In 1969 he hired a young member of the ""counter culture"", Jack Calmes, to be his manager. Calmes got him booked at the 1969 Texas Pop Festival, alongside Led Zeppelin and others; and got him signed to Leon Russell's new label, Shelter Records. Shelter records was based in Oklahoma, and featured blues/rock performers such as Linda Ronstadt and Joe Cocker. The company treated Freddie as an important artist, flying him to Chicago to the former Chess studios for th recording of his first album, and giving him a supporting cast of top-calibre session musicians -- including Russell, a rock pianist.

&gt; As were many of the top bluesmen of his generation, he was now playing what he affectionately called the ""Fillmore circuit"", playing alongside the big rock acts of the day for a young, mainly white, audience. As a result of his touring with Eric Clapton, the two became good friends -- Clapton held him in very high esteem -- and following his term at Shelter Records, Freddie signed with the label Clapton was recording for, RSO. His first album there, Burglar, was produced by Clapton, and had him playing on several tracks.

&gt; He continued to tour heavily. He died in Dallas in 1976 from a heart attack and complications arising from bleeding ulcers and pancreatitis. He was just 42 years of age. Read more on Last.fm.

11158,"&gt; The US has just as many guns per capita as it did in the past.

But has its rate of firearm deaths involving police officers changed? I honestly don't know. 

I agree with almost everything you're saying, but I can't agree with the idea that *literally almost anybody* being able to own a gun plays no part in the trigger-happiness of cops. I'll offer a comparison. I live in the UK. It's definitely no oil painting when it comes to violent crime, but almost nobody owns a gun. Farmers, hunting lodges etc. That's about it. Number of people shot by the police in the last thirty years? About 50. Number of people shot by the police in the USA in January of this year? About 50.

Training absolutely is key; that's just what I was saying to the other poster above. In all of these videos that you see, what is striking is the total lack of attempts at de-escalation. I would say that the reverse is true in almost every one I've seen; the cop escalates the situation themselves. But the existence of hundreds of millions of guns, and the doubt that would sow in the minds of everyone concerned, can't just mean nothing.",worldnews

Struggling SP and bullpen: Walks always raise the run expectancy for your opponent. They're basically free runs. They up your pitch count more than hits, without producing an out, plus show a lack of command/control. Teams that don't issue walks tend to pitch better across the board.

Struggling lineups: Conversely, lineups that struggle also struggle to draw walks. Walks extend opposing pitch counts, chase starters, put pressure on bullpens. Everything I said about run expectancy applies here as well. Adding a free baserunner improves the likelihood you will score runs.",baseball

Kunitz is way past his prime, dude was struggling to get points during the regular season playing most of his minutes with Malkin or Crosby. Replacing him with someone from their farm team can payoff, but that remains to be seen. Bonino is a bit of loss in terms of his PKing ability and the occassional clutch goal, but don't let his regular season goal totals fool you, he was pretty awful for 75% of the regular season, and killed it in the last few months scoring all his goals. He was a sub 45% possession player. The question is who they replace him with, and so far, they haven't replaced him with anything so that remains to be seen.

11187,"Not that he was nearly as essential as Cliff in the songwriting, but to be fair to Jason, I believe I have read that from the beginning he was never allowed nearly as much creative latitude or input as Cliff, and was never really made to feel entirely part of the band because they always kindve looked at him like a stand-in for Cliff. 

I'd be interested to see what might have been created if his ideas were more included into the mix. He did write the Blackened riff, so he was off to a pretty fucking epic start. Later, I don't know if it was only the bass lines or if it was more, but also My Friend of Misery, and devil's dance, and a few others. 

By comparison, (and I say this with ton of respect and admiration to Kirk and him being my idol as a kid and the reason I picked up a guitar) Kirk as far as I know has pretty much only contributed the ""die"" riff on creeping death and hit a mega home run with enter sandman. Obviously, he wrote solos to pretty much every song, more than a few of which are legendary too. 

The interesting thing about all that to me is not that it's a lack of creativity or skill by them, but the awe of the amount and quality of riffs that come out of James.

11242,"According to the article, Hip Hop/R&amp;B are responsible for 25% of music consumption (&amp; ~30% of all on demand streams in US), with Rock at 23%. Two combined genres beating one. Not too surprising (especially because pop and r&amp;b can kind of blend together sometimes). Along with the fact that Hip Hop &amp; R&amp;B are consumed primarily by younger generations who are more active on the internet and more likely to use an on demand streaming service &amp; listen to more music. 

I think when people are younger they are more music oriented/obsessed, so whatever is popular with kids/teenagers/young adults is the primary genre(s) for hits. That's why the new ""hit"" music is almost always Pop or R&amp;B (Hip Hop too but it's not as radio friendly so more R&amp;B).

All I'm trying to say is that I think as we get older, we tend to keep enjoying what we liked when we were younger. And when we're younger, we're listening to the currently popular new music. Rock was ""the thing"" before R&amp;B, Pop, and Hip Hop. That's why it's next biggest in consumption. Now all new hit music is R&amp;B, Pop, and Hip Hop (looking at Spotify's ""New Music Friday"" about 80% falls into these 3 genres). All this article shows is that R&amp;B and Hip Hop are the currently popular new music that younger people are listening to.

Now this could all be nonsense because I haven't had coffee yet, but I hope I got my point across.

Some BIOS don't beep at all if everything is okay, but if you computer isn't beeping at all, the only error is that there is no power to the computer. Since you can turn your computer on fine, I'm guessing it isn't that.

The reason phone-support IT wants you to restart the computer even when you say you already have isn't just because they're following a script - the beep the computer makes can alert them to different hardware faults.

* McCree is wandering a vigilante, last seen in Mexico

* Reaper is working as one of the leaders of Talon

* Soldier 76 is with Ana, last seen in Egypt.

* Mei (never was an agent) is... Mostly unknown, trying to save ecosystems and nature.

* Torb has been doing big things, such as stopping Sven in a fictional country I forgot the name of. He is currently with Bastion.

* Reinhardt is touring Europe with his mechanic/squire Brigitte

* Mercy is practicing medicine in the middle east.

As for other non-Overwatch characters:

* Pharah is working for Helix.

* Hanzo is wandering the world

* Junkrat and Roadhog are still on their international crime spree

* D.Va, Orisa and Zarya are defending their homelands of Korea, Numbani, and Russia respectively

* Lucio is... Probably on a world tour? We dont know

* We also dont know what Symmetra or Zenyatta have been up to either.

For Talon however, before Doomfist's launch and Masquerade, we knew next to nothing about them. Ana's comic and Sombra's short did not tell us much either, despite putting Talon in major roles for both. They were still more centralized around Ana/Jack and Sombra respectively. Masquerade has shed significant light on what Talon is, answering a few questions people had while also opening a lot of doors.

Sure, the registry may not be great, but scrapping it is not the solution. Weapon registrations are the norm in majority of the first world: 

Australia requires registration of all guns, and bans all semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. 

United Kingdom requires Each firearm to be registered on a Firearms Certificate (FAC) or shotgun certificate, and bans semi-automatic rifles and handguns.

In late 2007 the European Parliament and Council adopted a legislative report to tighten gun control laws and establish an extensive firearms database. Passed with overwhelming backing, the tough new gun control rules were ""hoped to prevent Europe from becoming a gun-friendly culture like the United States""

I've had a lot of food that I've eaten over the years that I didn't like the texture of, and I respect that.   It's not that she has never had a good steak, it's just that she genuinely does not prefer that particular texture (but really enjoys a well done steak).

Regardless of how it's cooked, that person is going to chew it up and eat it... It doesn't affect me how they decide to cook their food and it seems a silly thing to get up in arms about.

Last year she was driving my sister home after they had run some errands, including picking up a prescription for a new medication for my sister. My sister took it in the car on the way home.

By the time the ambulance arrived, my sister was partially conscious. She was released from the hospital later that day, thankfully. She underwent testing to make sure it wasn't a neurological condition, but everyone is certain it was the medication.

My mom told me that it's the first time she ever seriously feared that one of her children was going to die, right there in front of mer. My sister's pulse had dropped significantly and her breathing was very shallow. She's told me that she's glad she had the wherewithal to react as quickly and effectively as she did by getting my sister on the ground and calling 911. My mother couldn't drive by that spot for months, and my sister still has panic attacks if the conditions are similar to when she had the seizure. Luckily it's never happened again.",AskReddit

On a side note, I think it would be interesting if there were a system where you can select your ""current main(s) "" and it pairs you up with complementary teammates. Then, everyone gets to play what they want with a balanced comp. 

The thing that killed this game for me was the constant in-fighting. It's almost like road rage. People can't help themselves. 

And a big part of that rage might be because this is a game of counters, rather than teamwork. If everyone chose  1 character on the enemy team to counter, that team will win. But that's now how it should work. A good team build should be able to stand on its own against anything. And every combination of teams needs to be able to stand up on its own against anything.

Basically, when every possible combination is perfectly balanced, people will stop raging. But that's not how this game works. So people will rage on because their teamate won't pick an obvious counter and the rager can't change. 


People rage in this game more than I've ever had in any game. The game itself kind of is responsible, because the balancing is frustrating. ",Overwatch

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b7e01bad932a4b3f822e783801146b9a.png)  

&gt; Gilbert O'Sullivan was born Raymond Edward O'Sullivan on 1st December 1946 in Waterford in Ireland.  His father worked in a meat factory while his mother ran a sweet shop.  In 1958 at the age of 11 he moved with his family to Swindon in England in search of a better life.  He attended St. Joseph's Comprehensive school in Swindon.  While there he developed an interest in both music and amateur boxing.  Musically he began with the guitar and progressed to the piano.  In the boxing ring he had nearly 50 bouts.  Meanwhile his painting and drawing had won him a place at Swindon Art College.  He started there in September 1963.  His aim was to be a graphic designer.  He played drums in his first group The Doodles and left them to join The Prefects while attending Swindon Art College.  It was while at college that he met Rick Davies, who was later a member of Supertramp.  While at college he began writing songs and sending out demo tapes, alas they were always returned unopened.  The first song he remembers writing was Ready Miss Steady.

&gt; After finishing college, Gilbert moved to London in 1967 to try and further his musical career.  He took a part-time job as a salesman at the C &amp; A department store in Oxford Street.  Mike Ward who also worked at C &amp; A, had a contract with CBS and Gilbert went with him one day and played his tapes for some of the CBS executives.  Gilbert signed a five year publishing contract with CBS which called for one single a year, and released two singles Disappear/You in 1967 and What Can I Do/You in 1968.  Gilbert was disappointed that he was not allowed any input into the arranging or production of the singles.  Neither single did well.  Disillusioned with CBS, Gilbert signed with the Major Minor label and released I Wish I Could Cry/Mr. Moody's Garden in 1969.

&gt; Gilbert came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 disc jockey, John Peel, who gave him a slot on his radio show Top Gear, little of note resulted, and O'Sullivan spent part of 1969 applying to other record labels and management companies.  It was at this time that Gilbert formulated his 'Bisto Kid' image; grey flannel suit, flat cap, school boy tie, football socks and hobnail boots.  In search of a manager he sent some demo tapes to Gordon Mills, an ex-pop singer and himself a songwriter of repute, who had successfully guided the careers of Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck.  Gordon Mills recognised something unique in the young Irishman and signed him for management as well as to a songwriting contract.

&gt; Gilbert made an irresistible impression with Nothing Rhymed, his first Top 10 hit and an introduction to his witty lyrics and original approach as a singer/songwriter.  Signed to MAM Records, the label launched by Gordon Mills, who was also his record producer, great friend and surrogate older brother, O'Sullivan enjoyed four years of major success, incorporating a dozen more hit singles, ten of which reached the UK Top 10, and four Top 5 albums: Himself (1971), Back To Front (1972), I'm A Writer Not A Fighter (1973) and A Stranger In My Own Back Yard (1974).  

&gt; Both Clair (written about Mills's infant daughter for whom Gilbert occasionally babysat) and Get Down were number one hit singles in Britain, and additionally, Back To Front topped the UK LP chart in 1972, emulating the success of the two million seller Alone Again (Naturally), a six week US chart-topper in 1972.  Gilbert made his live debut in The National Stadium in Dublin in October of '72.  Around this time, the singer jettisoned his so-called ""Bisto Kid"" image in favour of an endless series of collegiate-styled sweaters embossed with the letter ""G"".  As quickly as O'Sullivan ascended to fame, however, his star began to fall , although singles like Ooh Baby and Happiness Is Me and You continued to chart, they sold increasingly fewer copies, and after 1973 his overseas popularity essentially ceased altogether. At home, he notched his final Top 20 hit with 1975's I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You.  After a Greatest Hits album in 1976, and Southpaw in 1977, by which time the hit singles had dried up, disagreements over future direction led to a bitter split between O'Sullivan and Mills, which effectively sidelined the former as a recording artist for five years.  The gruelling court case between O'Sullivan and his erstwhile manager, producer, music publisher and record company boss finally gave him control of his own recordings and the copyright in his songs, although it exacted an inevitable toll on his energy and his creativity during it's precedent-setting course.

&gt; Gilbert returned to CBS in 1980 and released Off Centre (1980) and Life &amp; Rhymes (1982) but maintained a low profile during much of the 1980s, recharging his batteries and moving to Jersey, where he still lives with his wife and two children.  Off Centre provided his 13th UK Top 20 single, What's In A Kiss?, after which legal proceedings monopolised his time.  However, he continued writing songs, performing what he called ""concepts within four walls"" rather than starting back on the road before it was appropriate.  He later recalled that the lyrics he wrote during that period were too heavily influenced by his personal emotions - having been extremely close to Mills before their disagreement, he was highly distressed to discover that his dear friend had been guilty of considerable financial greed at Gilbert's expense.  Even so, he applied himself to his lonely creativity, working from 9 to 5 each day ""just like Goffin &amp; King and people like Neil Sedaka &amp; Howard Greenfield at the Brill Building in New York used to do"", although he later confessed ""Really, the words were no good, because my mind was cluttered with all the problems"".  Lyrics have always been O'Sullivan's most unique facet, reflecting what's going on in his mind, and the strain under which he found himself was hardly conducive to much positive artistic or commercial creativity.

&gt; The first release for five years was Frobisher Drive and was only available in Germany.  The same album with a slightly different track listing was released in the UK in 1989 under the title In The Key Of G, and included So What, his first chart single in almost a decade.  Since the low-key comeback, the pace has increased, with five more albums.  Gilbert also made a return to live performances in the early nineties, playing regularly in both Europe and Japan.  In 1991, Gilbert was again in court, this time he sued American rapper Biz Markie and won the decision after Markie's unauthorized sample of ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" on his 1991 album I Need a Haircut.  A 1992 single, Tomorrow Today had topped the Japanese charts for nine weeks, and this success led to a tour of Japan in early 1993 with his newly formed backing group, during which he recorded and filmed his first ever live album Tomorrow Today.  Gilbert's newfound success in Japan led to the Japanese only release of The Little Album (1992) and Rare Tracks (1992).  1993's critical acclaimed Sounds Of The Loop (Daily Telegraph's Record Of The Week) included a duet with the legendary Peggy Lee on Can't Think Straight and even a solo version of the same song in Japanese.  This album was recorded almost entirely at his home in Jersey in the Channel Islands.

&gt; By Larry (with a similar track listing to the Japanese released The Little Album) was released in 1994.  Larry is a famous English cartoonist, much admired by Gilbert.  Larry provided original cartoons for the album sleeve and booklet.  Every Song Has It's Play was released the following year and was the soundtrack of the semi-autobiographical stage show that Gilbert had acted and sang in, in 1991.  Singer Sowing Machine was released in 1997.  The title is a humorous reaction by Gilbert to being constantly referred to as a singer/ songwriter.  Irlish was released in 2000 and yielded three singles, Have It, Say Goodbye and Two's Company (Three Is Allowed).  The album title Irlish,  combination of the words Irish and English, appropriate for someone born in Ireland and raised in England.   Gilbert's family was part of this migration.  In 2001 The Official Gilbert O'Sullivan Website was launched as well as his own record label ByGum Records.

&gt; Gilbert continued to tour and he played a series of concerts in Ireland in 2001 and in the UK in 2002 to promote the Irlish album.  A new studio album Piano Foreplay followed in 2003.  In 2004 Rhino Handmade Records released a 3 CD anthology in the USA of Gilbert's music entitled Caricature: The Box.  It contains 73 tracks which span the years 1967-2001.  This is the first in-depth survey of Gilbert's lengthy career. It contains numerous singles and B-sides, tracks from 16 of his albums, and five previously unreleased tracks.  A b-side collection entitled The Other Sides of Gilbert O'Sullivan was released in Japan in 2004 and contained many tracks available on CD for the first time.  A series of concerts followed in Japan in June 2004 followed by a 20 date European Tour of the UK, Ireland, Norway and Denmark in November and December.  In February 2005 a DVD/CD set of the 2004 Japanese show was released in Japan.  Gilbert returned to Japan in June 2005 for a series of 13 shows.  Gilbert spent the end of 2005 and the beginning of 2006 recording his next studio album ""A Scruff At Heart"" which was released in Japan on 25 October 2006. Read more on Last.fm.

11640,"&gt; i dont understand why people are mad at big for using this, it's in the game so why not abuse it

Because in a lot of CSGO tournaments, the abuse of a bug is strictly prohibited by the rulebook. While no one has a ruling against this exact bug, in the case of ESL it would have been up to the admins to decide whether it was game breaking or affected the outcome of the game.  

As it says here, in section 6.5, use of bugs and glitches: https://gfx.esl.eu/media/eu/csgo/eslone/katowice2015/ESLOne_CSGO_Rulebook.pdf  

&gt;The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game are penalized with six (6) minor penalty points per incident, up to a maximum of eighteen (18) minor penalty points per match. Furthermore, it is up to the admins discretion whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not he will award rounds, or the match to the opposing team, or to force a rematch. In extreme cases, the penalty for abusing bugs may be even higher.  
&gt;The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden, if any bug is used which is not listed here it is up to the admins discretion whether or not a punishment is necessary.  
 

&gt;Generally, the use of any bugs in the game is strictly forbidden. (For example: spawn bugs).
An exception are the following bugs which are explicitly allowed:  
- Defusing the bomb through walls and items etc.  
- So called “surfing” on tubes  
- So called “fireboost”  
The tournament directions reserves the right, also retroactively, to add more bugs to the list of explicitly
allowed bugs  

Now I'm unable to find the rulebook for PGL and their major, but a bug like this being abused could be something that an Admin could have to decide upon. ",GlobalOffensive

If being dated by today's standards really were at the crux of the issue though. Why doesn't Bakemonogatari suffer as well? It too was an LN adaptation that played a part in making LN adaptations super popular. And it also had a lot of weird meta-commentary/humor often based in very 00's tropes and cliches. Presumably Monogatari's reputation would suffer similarly if that were really the motivating factor. Yet I only really see it leveled at Haruhi.

Personally, that implies to me that the adage of it being dated is more an excuse to justify its low reputation. Rather than the actual cause. But I am personally biased in this, so I could be wrong.

I live 5 hours by (a very expensive) bus from the nearest train station (not high speed trains). Airfares are insanely high and there are few planes each day.  My town has everything you need for daily life, but it's 3 hours by car from the next proper town and 5 hours from the next 'city'. Only a few areas are connected to the city centre with regular buses (every half hour in the middle of the day, every hour after 6pm), in the weekends and in some areas there are usually no more than 3-4 buses in a day, none 'late' at night. We pay 4-5 dollars for each trip, even if it's less than 5 minutes long. In addition, gas is extremely expensive, so owning a car might not help much. The landscape is very steep in most areas, making bikes impractical. And I live in a very connected place compare to smaller 'towns' in the area.

You only need to keep your fellow politicians happy to stay as commissioner.

You wont vote a commission out over one commissioner, hence the job as commissioner is always safe. None of this is by accident.

12139,"You are inadmissible to Canada under A36(2)(b). 

If this is the only offence you've ever committed (as an adult), you are inadmissible for a period of 10 years from the date you completed all of your sentencing requirements. If, for example, you were ordered to pay a fine, complete a class, and/or undergo probation, the timer doesn't start until you completed all of those requirements. After 10 years, you are no longer inadmissible and undergo the same process as those without criminal convictions.

However, after just 5 years, you can apply directly for criminal rehabilitation ($200), which if successful, would result in the same outcome as above. It takes 8 months currently for applications to be processed in the USA.

TRPs can be processed at the port of entry or consulate. You don't have 8 months to wait, so only the POE route would work. You should be aware that officers at a POE will often come to differing decisions based on the same set of evidence. Moreover, you do not have a strong case. A TRP is supposed to be issued when there is strong evidence for economic, scientific, or academic benefit to Canada and/or a humanitarian and compassionate rationale. With that said, it is the officer's choice and some may go out of their way to help you. By regulation, they are instructed to be more conservative and not issue a TRP absent a strong case. 

If you are refused entry, be aware you will be immediately removed from the country, if there are no flights for the rest of the day you may be held in a cell, and your airline will charge you for the cost of the flight back. 

Lawyers and immigration consultants offer a service in which they prepare a TRP application for you, so that you are sure to have everything required and make the officer's job easier (so that he is more likely to help). These range in price from 1000-2000 USD.

12167,"Yes it is the main game but you have two seperate modes of this main game - QP and comp. Comp is obviously for playing serious games and QP is casual for practicing/having fun while playing the main game. Arcade is nowhere near enjoyable/fun for people who like to play the main game mode.

So if I want to get better at McCree for example I will try to shoot people as much as I can, challenge everyone as much as I can and dying. Does that mean I'm uncooperative? If I want to learn how to flank as Reaper and I keep sneaking around/teleporting behind enemies and dying all the time does that mean I'm uncooperative? If I want to learn how to pin people as Reinhardt and keep charging into enemies and dying does that mean I'm uncooperative?

You are definitely forcing rules on people by making them cooperate by your rules and your view of how to win the game. Not everyone needs to play like pros and pick by their meta. I can win by playing a ""deathmatch"" as you say and killing the whole enemy team by myself and a teammate Zen and capture the point. Does that mean we were the bad/uncooperative players and the other 4 in our team waiting outside to charge their ults were the correctly playing best teammates?

Leaving QP games gives you XP reduction as a punishment which is not really a punishment unless you care about XP as I stated in my previous comment.

12168,"not necessary that they shouldn't have more gear, but instead that you shouldn't be punished so hard for taking time away from the game and focusing more on your life between tiers. Trust me I'm not trying to take your legendaries away, and in MMOs its always been a thing that they want you playing in some form 24/7, but this system brings it to another level. There is no reason you should be expected to make a game you pay to play a major part of your every day life. A lot of raiders have voiced this opinion by quitting or going completely casual, because in the current model, the old model of playing doesn't fit. you can't devote a month or two to the game and take a month or two off anymore, its either you play constantly or don't play at all and its really just not practical with real life.

EDIT: I feel the need to also bring up the fact that certain(a lot) of classes and the way to play them correctly is tied directly to certain leggos. If it was that leggos just added some extra stats, or added an effect that buffs you but not complete changing your rotation and play style, then the amount of RNG tied to them wouldn't be so bad, but because some classes have make-or-break leggos and you have a chance to not get them until the end, and there is not direct path to get these or choose which you get, it seems a little broken.

How can a team with as much talent as the Lions have just crap the bed like this? I know, I know, “Lol lions, lol Detroit” but step back and look at them. They have the best WR in the game. They have a very competent though not elite QB in Stafford, who has stayed healthy. Their defensive line is absurd. Reggie Bush has been doing things. How did this happen?

I know that after he outcoached Phil Jackson and Erik Spoelstra that I may get downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but the Mavericks didn't win because of his adjustments. After watching him coach in Dallas for three years, nothing he did in the finals was innovative or unique. 

Dallas has been playing zone since he's coached here, with great success, so it was a given that he would play the numbers and let Wade and LeBron take long jumpshots.

JJ Barea has already been a starter before two years ago to jumpstart a sometimes slow offense. Starting him wasn't a risk, look back on the first quarters in the Dallas-San Antonio series from 2009, the Mavs scored 18.5 points per 1st quarter with Barea on the bench compared to 30 points per 1st quarter with Barea as a starter. Barea was a known commodity, something that he had to do because Dallas kept falling behind against Miami.

Edit: I'm not saying he's a bad coach by any means, but I hear too many people here in Dallas salivating over how starting Barea was brilliant or how Carlisle's zone owned the Heat. Remember that Dwane Casey was the one teaching and coaching the defense on the sidelines, not Carlisle.",nba

12450,"&gt;Calvin Broadus, Jr., alias Snoop Dogg, recently released a music video for a rap song called “Lavender” in which he aims a handgun right at the skull of a clown dressed as President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Dogg — who pled no contest to felony gun possession in April 2007 — pulls the revolver’s trigger. Out pops a red and white flag that reads: “Bang.”

&gt;Hilarious.

&gt;Imagine the national collapse that would have ensued if, say, a country-music star released a video in which he leveled a shotgun at an Obama-like clown, only to have sawdust fly from the barrel.
‌
&gt;In response to muted criticism of Mr. Dogg’s video, rapper Clifford Joseph Harris Jr., a.k.a. T.I., called Trump a “F***ing Tangerine Tanned Muskratscrotum skin, Lacefront Possum fur Wig wearing, Alternative fact, Atomic Dog diarrhea face a** man!!!!”

&gt;Also from the relentlessly tasteful world of rap “music,” Big Sean’s freestyle number contributes this to the national debate:

&gt;I know Jay proud of me, he put this ’round my neck/ And I might just kill ISIS with the same icepick/ That I murder Donald Trump in the same night with.

&gt;Madonna, the global pop star whose albums have sold 306 million copies, erupted at the January 21 Women’s March in Washington, D.C.: “Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”

&gt;Meanwhile, Adam Pally, star of Fox TV’s Making History, told TMZ that if he could travel through time and spend an hour with anyone, “I’d have to kill Trump or Hitler.”

&gt;Soon after Trump was elected, British journalist Monisha Rajesh remarked, “It’s about time for a presidential assassination.”

&gt;Matt Harrigan former CEO of PacketSled, a San Diego-based cybersecurity company, was eerily specific about his desire to whack Trump.

&gt;“I’m going to kill the president. Elect,” Harrigan posted on Facebook last November. He added that he was “getting a sniper rifle and perching myself where it counts. Find a bedroom in the whitehouse that suits you m*****fucker. I’ll find you.”

&gt;Two days after Reddit users noticed Harrigan’s vicious, error-filled death threats, PacketSled’s board of directors accepted his resignation.

&gt;None of this is cute or charming. The Secret Service should investigate all such episodes, including the Trump haters who have roped even America’s kids into their wicked schemes.

&gt;As the East Orlando Post reported, a University of Central Florida group called Knights for Socialism staged an event last month at which it encouraged visiting grammar-school students to use a baseball bat to smash piñatas bearing photos of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and presidential adviser Steve Bannon.

&gt;None of this is cute or charming.

&gt;“Come beat Jeff Sessions’s face in,” said one organizer. “It’s free.”

&gt;On a video of the gathering captured by UCF College Republican Douglas Mactye, a little boy asks: “Can I kill Donald Trump?”

&gt;Peaceful protest is among the things that make America great. But no facet of the First Amendment shields those who promote the assassination of the President of the United States.

&gt;With millions of Americans in a state of perpetual rage, it takes just one deranged leftist to put Donald J. Trump in his crosshairs and pull the trigger. This is especially worrisome given the three security breaches at the White House just this month. In one incident, Jonathan Tran, 26, scaled three barriers and then spent 16 minutes strolling the grounds of the executive mansion while Trump was inside.

Good:  People tend to be pretty outdoorsy and active.  There are a lot of beautiful places to go and hike.  The winters are great.  They're not very cold at all.  It doesn't snow all the time, but when it does, we get a shit ton.  I like that there's no snow, no snow, BAM! SNOW!, then it all melts in a few days.  I stay because family is here, which is very helpful with little kids.

Bad:  The food is terrible.  Other than a downtown Denver, most people don't support mom &amp; pop shops.  Almost all restaurants and stores are national chains.  Although people are very outdoorsy and active, almost no one walks places outside of a small area downtown.  Everyone drives to go places.  People are very into hunting and gun rights.  People here tend to be very against taxes and programs that help the poor &amp; disabled.  We have some of the highest drug use in the country (which is not good when you're raising kids), and there are medical marijuana clinics EVERYWHERE, which is, again, not good when you're raising little kids.  There are a lot of affluent people, too, and they tend to be very greedy with their money.  The wealthiest buy large acres of land and keep just enough animals to be able to call their land ""agricultural"" and not pay residential taxes.  This type of entitled attitude really upsets a lot of disgruntled youth, and we end up with a lot of school shootings, mall bombings, etc.  Festivals and the like are few and far between (as compared to other places I'm familiar with) and generally don't attract many people.  People here tend to keep to themselves, as compared to some places that are very community-oriented.  Summers are extremely dry, and they're usually followed by ""fire season.""  This year is a welcome exception.  We have very little cloud coverage because we're up so high.  It sounds nice, but the sun is brutal.  It sucks to always have to wear sunglasses outside.  Also, springs and falls (my favorite seasons) tend to be non-existent.  Most years, it'll jump from the 40s of winter to the 80s of summer in a matter of a couple weeks.  This year, again, was a nice exception.  Although winters are great, we don't fund our cities very well.  They basically never salt sidewalks or streets, and they usually run out of money for plowing.  Main streets are usually plowed, but side streets are almost never plowed.

TL; DR: Colorado has high drug use, and the people tend to keep to themselves.  There are a lot of school shootings, mall bombings, etc.  Winters rule, but the other seasons really bite.

she just doesnt really do much. the only thing she is like good at is clearing the jungle somewhat fast (but thats not even that good anymore because powerfarming got nerfed with the s7 jungle spawntimer change . well and krugs suck)

she has a useless passive and its design is very bad. its kinda like kindred where you are not guaranteed to get stacks but in shyvanas case she atleast doesnt need them (i dont think changing her passive to give like bonuses for dragon kills is a good idea either some ppl have suggested it. you are not guaranteed to get drakes and you even if you get some you dont always get useful ones. sometimes you just cant afford going for drake)

her q is .. well its a bit of dmg (got nerfed at some point so unless you put points in it sucks)

w is like her only good spell. deals quite ok aoe dmg. clears waves/jungle camps and also gives her a speedboost

her e is meh. like ok you get dmg on auto attacks but you arent actually that good at sticking to a target because no cc (while the duration of the debuff actually isnt that long). and tbh its just a really lame ability. you are a half dragon and what can you do? yea spit a little flame ... woooh

and her ult is well. probably the worst engage type ult in the game. you jump into the enemy team (until like a few months ago you could even get cced out of it) and do a little knockback ... also grants small bonus effects to your other abilities which are like ok but not really that noticable. you dont really become much stronger in ult form

ever since shyvanas base dmg got nerfed back when she was played to lane she was pretty mediocre (yes she worked with feral flare/devourer vs ppl that didnt know how to play) you cant build her super tanky anymore because ppl will just ignore you since your dmg isnt actually that good and you dont have cc. if you decide to build some dmg you will be pretty squishy and since shyv gets kited so easily you will probably just die without really accomplishing anything

i think a full rework would be the best for shyvana. unless you overtune her numbers she doesnt really work atm. like why would you pick her? dmg? others can do a lot of dmg and more reliable. tankyness? other champs are tankier with ok dmg and way more cc. jungle clear? yea camps respawn pretty slow so you dont need to clear that fast and there are enough champs that can clear fast while still having better ganks",leagueoflegends

So Hog is mainly used to counter other Dive Tanks. He didn't need the OHKO to stop D.Va and Winston. He just needed to do damage and fast. This is where I say upping his firing speed could work.

12834,"First off, we were talking about insects, not snakes or cuddlefish (which are quit intelligent). You would be right to say it's wrong for people to see them without sympathy, but the majority of people would definitely sympathize with a fish. There was a post of a fish being fried alive by a sushi chef not that long ago. There was a lot of outrage in the comments sections and I didn't see any jokes. 

And insects being merciless and cold is because they don't have a conscience and don't think twice about any and all actions. Being merciless, cold, cruel, and calculative is not synonymous with having a personality. Plus, I never said insects don't have personalities. They do, but this personality pretty much manifests itself in varying behavior (e.g. one bug might crawl one direction while another might crawl a different direction).

&gt;Who the hell are you to call them ""expendable""?

Don't try to make me look like a bad person. They have *evolved* to be expendable. Meaning that they have evolved to reproduce quickly, grow quickly, and die quickly. The individual is less important to the species as a whole. In the insects world, life is cheap and if a hundred thousand of a species die, it would barely make a dent in the total population. I don't consider them expendable, they are expendable. 

&gt;Also you provided NO citing for your assertions. In fact, most of them are just opinions.

It's funny how people will only demand citation when they disagree with something. My assertions are common knowledge. Insects are barely conscience. Their brain is simply a small bundle of nerves. They lack the biological structures that are necessary for higher brain function and thought. Yes, they are alive and do possess some sort of primitive consciousness, but it's barely there. 

&gt; and besides, it's not the misery of the animal that I or anyone else finds humorous, it's the fact that in a ludicrous sort of way, this picture rather perfectly parallels the scene from Lord of the Rings.

12848,"&gt; You seem to think there has to be this balance between the rich and the poor

Well, there does. But you've taken that concept to the extreme, as is common with ideologues. To say that there needs to be balance is not to say that everyone should have equal income.

An economy where the wealth all slides to a few *will* collapse. It is unstable and unsustainable. There does need to be a division that shares generated wealth across the population. Not equally per person. Economies work well within a range of relative wealth. Too little difference removes motivation for generating wealth. Too much difference leaves too little available to the masses to keep the economy running.

My definition of ""fair"" is based on the link I gave for the Ultimatum Game. Wealth is, by definition, excess output of labour over that which a person consumes for their own needs. By definition, it is the workers that create the wealth. They are the Player 2s (Deciders) in the Ultimatum Game. The business leaders generate the opportunities for wealth, not the wealth itself. They are the Player 1s, the Offerers. It is a symbiotic relationship if done well.

It is the structure of transactions that affect who gets what share. If structured such that the Offerers can take most of the wealth created by the Deciders, that is the very definition of a parasite. A parasite creates a power structure to take resources generated by somebody else.

Unions, regulations, or other forms of government driven benefits that force a more symbiotic split creates a more prosperous society than the parasitic one. And, as a voter, your personal interest is in a system designed to benefit *you*, not a select few of others.

Yes, unions can be greedy and bully. So can business owners. Using deadbeats as an argument against unions is a strawman and equivalent to me using sweatshops as an argument against business owners. As in the link, the whole point of fairness is to make sure that there is equal power, not one side of the relationship who can bully and exploit the other. That's my definition of fair.

And no, it has nothing to do with communism. It has everything to do with creating stable, sustainable prosperity and the best interests of all people, not just a select few.",canada

Once a new raid tier has begun, though, it no longer makes sense for old gear to WF/TF beyond new gear. That creates the trap of farming for the best available trinkets when you're A) not guaranteed a drop in the first place and B) are probably never going to see that specific piece titanforge.

I've done LFR ToS a couple of times now and usually regret it immensely. 

Firstly, I'm 931 equipped on my main tank. My alt is 925 equipped and my second alt is 921 equipped. 

My first run through, had a druid cotank that seemed to be decently geared, but didn't really know the fights so we just chatted about them in whispers. No threat issues, and they were good on the swaps. 

Second run through... fairly fresh cotank... with some other VDH thrown in (he queued as DPS because they had a satchel, but ""I do more DPS as tank lol I'm not switching to DPS"") that would cause the boss to randomly turn and hit the raid with stuff because they didn't seem to know that tank specs generate more threat, I dunno. 


Most recently, ran with a warrior... who couldn't keep threat at all. Usually I can auto attack while standing there with tanks, but not this guy. No idea what was up, but they ended up leaving after the second boss anyway... which leads us to... the fresh protadin (840!?) that must have been an offspec or something because I thought for sure you needed to be a bit higher ilevel than that to get in.  I'd say he needed to taunt... and he would be dead.  Pretty sure that they used 2 or 3 brez on him before just leaving him dead and healing through the purple lightning damage. 


Honestly, I'm probably going to stop running LFR. I don't particularly enjoy it, I only ran the previous raids lfr enough to get the tier set color transmogs and then stopped. While I've seen others get legendaries from it, I've never gotten one myself, and I only have 2 DPS legendaries left to get before I have all of them available to my class anyway, so I'm not in a rush.

&gt; The New Radicals were an alternative rock/power pop band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997, being centered around front-man Gregg Alexander, who wrote and produced all of their songs. They released only one album, 1998's 'Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too', a critically acclaimed pop rock album heavily influenced by classic  rock and soul of the 60s and 70s that contained— amongst radio-friendly pop tracks and love songs— strong criticism of corporate America and modern culture. Aside from Alexander, the only other permanent member of the band was keyboardist and former child actress Danielle Brisebois. The remainder of the line-up was a fluctuating one revolving around the two of them, with the goal being to bring in a variety of musicians from many genres. 

&gt; The band is best known for their debut single, titled ""You Get What You Give"", which became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom and has garnered major U.S. airplay for years. The song's celebrity-dissing lyrics at its end provided a minor a spectacle, with Alexander saying that the media misunderstood the meaning. Despite the song's radical messages, anti-materialistic as well as pro-youth, it's ironically been used in many films and even a famous advertising spot.

&gt; Tired of touring and promotional interviews, with the group becoming more and more commercialized, Alexander disbanded the group in mid 1999 before the release of their second single, titled ""Someday We'll Know"". He has successfully focus on writing and producing songs for other artists, winning a Grammy award for his talents. Consequently, the stunning ""Someday We'll Know"" received little attention in most countries. The band is widely considered a ""one-hit-wonder"". Read more on Last.fm.

Also as i looked at your trinket cast as far as i recall you want to use your trinket at 15 stacks of crusade, im using goroth fight as an example you used even before wake. So get 15 stacks and use it after.

Remember that trinket is best used in a scenario where boss doesn't move aswell as you want to stack 2 ghosts on top of each other.

Ok more looking into:

Demonic inquisition: you didn't use your specter during crusade at all, also you are using TV at start which honestly you should have the bosses both stacks during opener with bloodlust to burst them down.

Harjatan: same applies for umbral at 15 stacks i think which you did there although it ended make sure you use it on top of as many mobs as possible.

Mistress : your crusade was casted at 20 sec into fight? you wanna do it on pull and again use your trinket like umbral/specter/vial at 15 stacks of crusade.

Sisters : I imagine horn placed your specter at that late meaning you miss out on 15 stacks of cruade on specter,  im not sure but its probably worth casting horn 5 sec before pull so you can get 15 stack specter out.

Desoalce : same as again umbral is higher priority in this fight imo, its even worth casting it with less stacks since adds die so fast anyhow.

The impact was negligible and then if you factor in 'imported emissions', which were conveniently excluded,  you'll find that most countries actually increased emissions.

So tell me how the Paris Accord has fixed the challenges the Kyoto Protocol faced.

Even if every single country meets expectations of the Paris Protocol (which they won't), once again, the difference in change will be miniscule that it will delay climate change by years, rather than actually fixing the problem.

The only argument I  ever hear about it is that 'it brings countries together...' That's not a solution when it's costing billions of dollars to do so without having any other major impact.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Is there a great story to be told about younger Han Solo that also includes Darth Vader in some role?  I'm sure there is.  Will this movie be it?  Who knows, but I'm much less confident that it will be based on the way they went about making it.

If someone had come up with a great story first, and that inspired Disney to make the movie, and then they made the movie in a way that gave confidence to the idea that it actually was a great story, then I would expect an enjoyable movie.  But here the process seems more like ""hey let's make a Han Solo movie so we can get a billion dollars no matter how it turns out"" and then they make a script, have creative problems with the directors, acting problems with the star, bring in a new director and reshoot most of the movie on a tighter schedule.

In contrast in the civil law system, a certain portion of the estate is reserved for certain people. Generally these include the spouse, children, and more rarely in some systems remoter relatives are included. The term for these people in English varies, since we don't have this concept in most English speaking countries (Scotland excluded). They include:

* obliged heirs
* compulsory heirs
* reserved heirs 
* forced heirs etc etc

In Scots law, which is based on Civil law, the system is (was? I don't know too much about Scots law) known as the legitim, and reserves portions for the spouse and children. The part that was due to the widow(er) was known as the widow's part, the part due to the children was known as the bairn's part, and the part able to be disposed by the deceased was the dead's part.

1- When action is taken, they can't give us details. The most they could tell us is that action has been taken against someone we reported, but they couldn't provide additional details for multiple reasons.

2- They cannot possibly follow up on every individual report. Multiple reports need to be given about the individual before they'll investigate. If you, and everyone else, stops reporting, action will never be taken.

3- Due to the above, it could take time before any action is taken, depending on how quickly people report.

13432,"Conservatism is for equality, feminism is for a fictitious idea of equity.  Feminism at no point tries to be equal.

Feminists say Feminists are for equality, yet now there is a push to get more female graduates through universities when female grads outnumber male ones, there is already more assistance for women, and there are official policies to discriminate against men.  Do feminists say a word about this because it's not equal?  No, instead, the focus is on how there is inequality because men outnumber women in one specific field at universities, STEM.  This inequality actually serves to achieve the lack of equity women receive in greater society, it's actually a good thing women are unequally represented and still receive preferential treatment, as it will result in faster equity elsewhere.

I think the best example of feminist equality in action is how 43% of domestic abuse victims are males.  Males are, by all means, able to physically defend themselves against women most of the time.  However, because we live in a society of equity, we apply social pressure to men to prevent them from using their strength, to attack, or defend.  Then, at the same time, we don't fund domestic abuse shelters for men and self proclaimed feminists harass people that open them to death.  However, this is a victory for feminism, because men being disallowed from protecting themselves by escaping a bad situation or using physical force, makes them have more equity to women.  When we're all suffering, we're all on level ground after all.

Brady is a relatively healthy QB, considering how long he's been in the league and amount of time he's missed.

He gets his ACL torn in week 1 the year after absolutely demolishing the league.  His team is better, and their back up QB leads them to an 11-5 record.  Not only does their 11-5 record not win the division, ***they don't even make the playoffs***.

How do you miss the playoffs with an 11-5 record?  

In 2016, 11-5 would've won 3 divisions, two more were 11-5, and was a better record than 5 playoff teams.


In 2015, 11-5 would've won 2 divisions, one more was 11-5, and was a better record than 5 playoff teams.


In 2014, 11-5 would've won only 1 division, two more were 11-5, and was a better record than 3 playoff teams.  Both NFC Wildcard teams were 11-5.

In 2013(Im stopping research after this one), it would've won 2 divisions, tied for two more(this is a really weird coincidence...), and was a better record than 3.

In 2008, the Patriots were 11-5, lost out on a tiebreaker to both the Dolphins(who picked #1 in the draft that year and had a new coach) and the Ravens.  The Colts took the other wildcard at 12-4.  The NFC had 2 teams over 11-5, 1 at 11-5, and 2 division winners were under 11-5.",nfl

2) Investing in a hard network takes a lot of money. In addition, most of the ILECs' networks started as municipally owned or at least financed, and were granted to the ILECs by virtue of a gauranteed monopoly. Even most ILECs would not and can not afford to lay new networks entirely today, and this is both in terms of internet but phone as well. Laying two networks would be highly costly and inefficient as well.

3) Apparently the leaders of these companies don't think so. In actuality, a monopoly is a very good thing if the only incentive is making money, or this case, a duopoly in much of Canada. The lack of regulations mean that we are now being gouged.

If there is a conspiracy it is that the entertainment industry plays to the lowest common denominator, because sadly there are a lot of people who would rather be spoon-fed ideas than go out and read something that challenges their understandings through an intelligent and serious approach.

&gt; 

As far as I'm aware that's true, but many languages also have regulatory bodies called a [language regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_regulators), language authority, or language academy.  Many such authorities release [prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription) dictionaries to set spelling and pronunciation.  The [1996 German reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography_reform_of_1996) is an example of a language authority dictating how a language is used.  That doesn't man that the language doesn't still a develop through usage, it just means it's not the only way the language develops and there's no way to stop it.  

French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese (multiple exist), Japanese, Russian, Swahili, Hindi, Arabic, etc. all have language authorities.  English is unusual in being a language so widely spoken without any language regulator.

English does have some regulation, but it's indirect.  It has dictionary publishers, and it was those being published that first set English spelling.  That's why when you read English from before the existence of the printing press, the spelling is so different.  That's also why American and British spellings differ: our dictionaries have diverged on spelling because our dictionary publishers were different.  English also has several [controlled versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language), too.

Everything else after TWS have me losing interest in this universe as every movie started to seem familiar in one way or another. Phase 3 has been particularly terrible.

Now I don't know if you know, but Canada is the second largest country in the world, nearly 40 times larger than the UK. We also have about half the population of that country.

Now most people don't consider this but every competing cellphone company does need to set up infrastructure to be able to provide coverage to the consumers. Given that the country is so large and the population density is scarce when compared to a country like the UK, its easy to see that there would be a significantly larger maintenance cost for the big 3 to be able to operate.

The UK has a population density of 255 people/KM^2. 

Canada has a poulation density of 3 people /KM^2.

So if I were to build a radio tower that covers 50km in either country, I'd have a little over 10,000 potential customers in the UK and less than 200 potential customers in Canada per tower.

&gt; families come in all shapes and sizes

Yes they are... but not in the sense you're thinking. They teach kids/teenagers the types of things they will encounter in their lives. Like I've said before being gay is not a choice so it makes sense that in schools they teach that some people are gay and how that works in sex ed. Families are a personal thing and every has their own, everyone treats and handles it different. Teachers are not teaching that families come in all shapes and sizes. Teachers don't teach how a family should be at all, in fact most do not ever teach anything about adoption (Pass Adoption being an alternative to having a biological child), very rarely is foster care every brought up, neither is who and who cannot adopt children (Unless asked by a child themselves and if the teacher knows the current legal standing well enough to answer said question). Schools facilitate discussion so to a degree given the right class room, with the right children, asking the right questions a topic of families and what's considered okay could occur though at a state school that discussion would be lead by students and moderated by teachers. Just because you don't accept that families ""Don't come in all shapes and sizes"" doesn't mean they don't, in a world where Gay's can legally get married, in some cases also then also adopt it's important that if the question arises people can discuss the issues, positives and effects of such a world. Schools are for engaging people in critical thinking and developing those skills. They aren't teaching people this, they are giving children/teens a space in which they can make their own mind up on the situation.

&gt; rights as a parent

Rights as a parent always, always come second to the rights of a child. Examples of this are plenty. If your kid does something you doesn't like (Let's pretend they decide God isn't their thing) and you go at them with a baseball bat or fists. The rights of the child are their to protect them from the abuse. The child would be removed from your care and you would be prosecuted for your actions. Now I'm not saying you would, that's just an example. But when discussion education it's important to think about the needs of a child, something that will change from person to person admittedly. When assessing the education needs of a child you must look at the world they are entering so the school can address things that will be common place in their lives, along side skills to develop them for work life and further education. Maths, English, Languages and Science are the clear objective truths which children are taught to give them the skills and knowledge they need to understand the world. Art, Design, Music, Drama, Dance, Physical Education are all more social and creative outlets children benefit from partaking it. Both for enjoyment and for the cultural aspects of them all. Religious Education however is where people differ, some want it to push certain religions onto children, some want it to exclude religions, some don't want it at all. Most people however would side with wanting it to teach a variety religions and their practices, beliefs, customs, traditions and the like without a heavy push towards any in particular. That's what should be happening in state schools which are aimed at education the general population as it needs to reflect the needs of a diverse group of people. If you want a specific education in religion (Something that could lead to poor cultural understanding in the future) you either teach that at home, go to a special school or home school your child for it. It's not the states job to push certain religions on your children.

On the topic of sex ed, again at state schools the requirement is to cater to the diverse population they deal with. That includes Gays, Lesbians, Transexuals and naturally heterosexuals. If you don't want your kids to have a full education on the topic... Home schooling and religious schools are options. Again though you do so knowing that there will be things that they will not understand when they grow up. You have a 'right' as a parent to choose what school they go to... You have an obligation as a parent to make sure they are being taught the things they need to be, even if that includes things which go against or contradict your beliefs. You have issues in America for example where they want to remove aspects of science from them to teach creation as a truth, even thought there is no evidence to support it. Wanting to remove evolution from science classes because the bible teaches creation, completely disregarding the scientific evidence for evolution, tests, facts, peer reviewed, replicated studies and tests. This is why separation of church and state is what keeps this from happening. It stops religions going into schools and applying their beliefs to the curriculum, disregarding scientific consensus and facts.


&gt;  I'm sick and tired of this aggression

Is it aggressive though?

Let's take a step back and consider this. You're in a country and a different religion is more prominent than yours. Lets say you're a Christian and majority is Sikh. Say the split is;

* 70% Sikh
* 10% Christian
* 10% Atheist
* 10% Muslim

All the groups pay tax to the same government, all the taxes are used to fund state schools and projects. Would you be okay then with the Sikh majority being able to influence how those funds are spent? Would you be okay with them using your tax money to erect Sikh monuments on public land while disregarding the other faiths? Would you want them teaching Sikh as a true religion in schools rather than teaching a variety of religious understandings?

So the answer of is it aggressive. Nope... though I will agree terms and conditions apply:

Yes there are people who take things to far and inflict hate upon Christian groups for their beliefs as there are with every group of people. Them being dicks still doesn't make evening the playing field aggressive... that makes the people being dicks aggressive.

I can see why you might think it's ""Aggressive"" places like America and assuming Malta where you are?
In a country which has for a long time now had a heavy push towards one side (Roman Catholic if Malta, Christianity in general in the US) the levelling of the playing field leads to seemingly huge changes. Especially when you don't appear to see why other groups are upset by it.

Some cases which show importantly why separation from church and state is important can ironically be shown by Americas ""Church of Satan"" which isn't actually a church for satan. When a religious group wants to impose it's views on state ran projects, using state money or the like ""Freedom of religion"" means that the state needs to treat all religions equally. When Religion groups do that Church of Satan also puts in their application... which tends to lead to the other religion stepping down (From imposing views on state/public things) not just because it's unconstitutional to do it. But because they want a monopoly on religion and don't want the Church of Satan to be able to display their beliefs.

The whole ""Families come in all different shapes and sizes"" thing once again... everyone has different beliefs on what a family is to what the people in it what it to be. You definition of family is heavily dictated by your religious views both directly and indirectly. Many people do not share the same faith as you and thus have different views on that. Other peoples views on what family means doesn't effect your family. As long as you're happy with how you and the people you love live, other people having enjoyable lives living how they want to live (Providing now one is harming anyone) will never change your families relationship. Cultures all over the World have different meanings to family and amazingly... they do just fine. From tribes in the amazon to people in America to Russians and east Asia. The concept of family changes but the consistent theme is one of love, caring, compassion and unity. The rest is cultural differences yet they all work. Just remember that just because a belief you hold is important to you... that doesn't mean that belief is right, applies to everyone around you, is well informed, is realistic or is wrong. To apply a narrow minded belief to a world of 7+ Billion vastly under estimates how varied our species is.

In addition to this. Separation of Church and State also does a lot to protect religions but that's a whole different topic all together.",europe

13974,"&gt;Whilst this sounds pretty major, I've been able to ignore it  

I'm going to tell you something that will seem harsh at first.  
My mother has RP. She did the ""I'm not really blind yet"" denial thing for ten years, from when I was 13 to 23. When her vision finally degenerated to the point where she couldn't pretend anymore, she lost it. Total mental breakdown. She was never a nice person before, but after she recovered she was a complete bitch. She gives herself a free pass to say anything to anyone, no matter how hurtful, under the guise of ""advice"" or ""truthfulness"". It's very clear from the outside that she considers herself so unfairly punished by the blindness that she gets to take it out on everyone around her in return. (this is not just a bitter child talking, this is a diagnosis...)

I have a good friend who is also blind, but she lost it overnight from diabetes complications. She has a good life. She's warm, positive, interested in other people, and doesn't bother with most special-treatment options like handicapped bathrooms or parking spaces. She's also done quite a bit of social/therapeutic work with blind people and told me something I hadn't known:  

RP has a reputation in the blind world as ""the crazymaker"" precisely because of the gradual onset and the chance to develop entrenched habits of denial.  

People with RP often are not offered support/counseling because of that same slow onset. They often suffer longterm but quiet depression, and often have a harder time coping in the end than people whose blindness comes on suddenly, presents them with a more ""deal with it"" situation. My mother is actually somewhat typical. 

Mackyt, it truly deeply sucks to be you. RP is a bastard. If you aren't letting yourself know this, if the people around you aren't giving you the support you need, GO FIND IT. START NOW. Get a good therapist and check in often.  Be proactive about being good to yourself.  

Oh, and OP? Go ahead and have those kids. Anything my mother sucked at as a mom was from lack of heart, not from her lack of vision. I've got a bunch of blind parent friends and they're doing just fine. ",AskReddit

13976,"&gt; Why in Hamburg of all places

This struck me as soon as I heard it would be in Hamburg. Whoever made this decision knew this would happen. Sternschanze riots are so common that ironically most people in the world don't even know about them. 2000 riot cops anywhere else in the world is front page news, out there it's just Tuesday.

I once went to Hamburg and stayed at a friends place less than 50m from Rote Flora and what I didn't know until I got there was that they had Schanzenfest that weekend. Normal street party until 21:30, by 21:45 all the street vendors have packed up and the temporary stage was dismantled and people started smashing a local bank and burning a huge pile of trash, at 22:00 literally two thousand riot cops and a few water cannons suddenly popped up. It was like it was a carefully planned schedule to the last minute. Most cafes and bars stayed open during the riots, we had beers in a bar less than 20 meters from a wall of cops and a water cannon. It was completely surreal how normal everyone was treating something that was exceptional for me. I checked the news the next day and nothing, not a single mention anywhere about something that looked like civil war to me. Since then I've been looking up information about riots in Hamburg and they happen _all the time_ and are pretty much never reported in the media.

Whoever decided that G20 should happen in Hamburg must have known about this. I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but this smells like something hugely unpopular will happen at the meeting and it was planned in riot central so that the riots would deflect attention from the politics.",europe
