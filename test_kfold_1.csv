4,"Was at a trampoline centre for my sisters birthday. We sat down to have a coffee after the session. I comment that the coffee was really hot and it could burn someone. 

The table next to mine was slightly sloped. A woman puts her baby in a high chair next to the table and the waiter puts the coffee down. Since the table was sloped I saw the coffee tip and run off the table. Woman leaps up to clean up the table. But the super hot coffee runs into the lap of the baby in the high chair. 

It starts screaming at it's scalding. The mum freaks out, not knowing what happened. I stand up and grab her baby and shout ""Hot coffee on its lap"" and rip the soaked romper off. I hand the baby back to the mum, jog to the fridge and grab 3 bottles of cold water to pour over the babies lap. 

While the mum is holding the baby I pour each bottle after another. I tell the stunned staff to call 000 and report a burn with hot water. I tell another staff to bring me a cold wet towel. 

I could see the babies skin was red but it wasn't a bad burn. I loosely wrap the baby in the cold wet cloth (while the baby is still in the arms of its mum), by now the baby was making happy baby noises. I collect my things and walk out with my sister and friends. 

As I walked out the ambulance was pulling up. 

So yeah, saving babies.

73,"Obligatory first time watcher, first rewatch thread, posted in most of the threads so far.

Crunchyroll's subtitles kept screwing up so I missed some of the dialogue, and watching the episode was a bit more frustrating than usual. I still enjoyed it, mostly.

At the beginning of the episode, we see that the girls' hard work has already started to pay off - actual recognition, a delay in shutting down the school, and a bump in their space. I imagine that Eli had something to do with this - in an earlier episode it seemed that the student council had considerable control over clubs. Even if they don't have explicit control, she's obviously got it good with the Director. From what I've gathered from other anime and from what the internet says, clubs are accountable to faculty advisers, but the student council seems to have a lot to do with organization.

Honoka genuinely is a force of nature. They see her coming and just know that there's nothing they can do but accept the glomp.

Umi makes it sound like Maki doesn't have a good head on her shoulders. Don't you do that to best girl. Like, pretty much every episode she's pointing out all the hurdles they still have to cross and shutting down people who are going to far. And Maki, what are you doing with Nico? No, girl, you've got so many better options.

I love how they just straight-up call out how yuri-baity Eli is, with Honoka's long, lingering evaluation. And I can't imagine that it's a coincidence that they flash the episode title - ""Wonder Zone"" - while the camera lingers on her legs and thighs (I know that it's actually the song about Akiba, but I can't imagine that the juxtaposition wasn't intentional. Nico getting mad that she's obviously not on Eli's level (in casual clothes *and* in the maid outfits), and then Nozomi making sure her waifu doesn't get to uppity, just adds to the comedy. It was just a really well-directed scene.

The trip to the school idol score just sounded straight-out pornographic. Hanayo and Rin need to keep it in their pants a little. And Nico is yet again causing trouble for people because she's putting the cart before the horse. Lady, you'll be hot shit at some point, and you're on your way there if you work really hard, but you don't need to be making everyone dress like a chilly asthmatic.

When I saw that Rin was legitimately fooled by Kotori's foreigner ""ruse,"" I immediately understood how she was failing in school. Everything immediately made sense. Also, Eli's face at that was absolutely priceless. Like, yeah, yeah, her heart is all melted and stuff, but she's constantly reminded that she's surrounded by idiots.

GODDAMN IT NOZOMI STOP GRABBING OR THREATENING TO GRAB PEOPLE'S TITS WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? I thought Nico was the pro stalker, but Nozomi taking it to a new, rapey level is just... Jesus, somebody call the cops. Please. She's got some redeeming qualities but I'm 90% sure that the signs on subways about reporting improper sexual contact are because she's going around going washi-washi on all the women. Gross.

Kotori's attempts at writing lyrics remind me of Mio's lyrics from K-On, except that Kotori's both worse at it and knows that she's not very good. I mean, both are good and wholesome girls but there's only so much you can write about things being cute and fluffy.

Also, Kotori is legitimately adorable in her maid outfit - she's pretty cool otherwise, too, and very athletic, but working in a maid cafe suits her well. I almost understand why maid cafes are popular in Japan now. But I will never understand why Japanese people are comfortable with ruining a perfectly lovely omurice with... blech... *ketchup*. Related to that is Kotori's admonishment that Umi needs to keep her smile on even when she's backstage - retail and customer-service employees have to do a lot of ""emotional labor"" to pretend to be happy in order to make other people feel good. I'll tell you, it's exhausting.

Honoka-Umi-Kotori lesbian poly triad is now canon.

On a fashion note, in addition to Nico having a casual outfit that looks a lot like a more straightened-out version of Honoka's top, Rin seems to have the same thing going on. I bet that's been the case this whole time and I just haven't paid attention. I thought I saw the same thing going on with Nozomi, but closer inspection makes me think that she's got a halter top or something like that underneath instead of a tank.

Cultural notes: While watching, as soon as I saw that picture of Kotori, I thought she must have had something to do with selling all of that unlicensed merchandise, so her being a maid cafe performer came out of left field. But maybe Japan has a less stringent legal perspective on copyright and image rights. I can't imagine being able to have a massive doujinshi market in the United States or most Western markets, but obviously that scene flourishes in Japan.

On a detail note, when Eli said goodbye to Umi and Honoka, she was turning into a street with a sign saying ""Matryoshka."" I went down the rabbit hole for a bit on researching Russians in Japan and the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, but Eli's family isn't particularly special. Her grandmother *might* have been the child of refugees from the Russian Civil War, apparently called in Japan the ""White Russians."" That would also explain, timeline-wise, why Eli's family went back to Russia during her childhood and the post-Soviet reforms, and then why they'd head back in time for school with the increasingly unstable political situation and economy.",anime

Two minutes later I finally came out of it but damn that was scary, I thought I was having a seizure or something. I had a seizure nearly a decade ago from some very potent mushrooms and have been scared I would have another one ever since.

I would just counter what you were implying a little bit by saying apart from just the run of the mill song writers, a lot of the people penning the songs were legit artists like Wilson Pickett, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Staple Singers, Isaac Hayes,  and later people like Michael Jackson, etc...

I mean (if you flash forward about 10-12 years) Prince is a good example of this himself. He probably had a period in the mid 80s where he wrote/produced more music for other people than he released for himself while also still being one of the most popular solo artists who played his own instrument. 

The difference between Prince and Dr. Luke is that Prince's talent, personality, bravado, imagery, etc... are all rooted in an artistic persona, where as Dr. Luke is a dude who makes a lot of money and [looks like a substitute teacher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Music-dr-luke.jpg).

Of course they will say that, they won't say ""fuck yo stuff i will ban you when i want to"". What they say is not important really. You know whats important? reports of automatic bans, confirmed by blizzard support.

&gt;  they absolutely 100% have ways to verify this information

I hope so. But here is the thing, its much cheaper and more manageable to ban first, and only verify those who actually contact support, because people who won't contact support probably know what they did and that they won't get the ban lifted because the evidence is there, and because this way you will have much lower load on your staff. 

&amp;nbsp;

Remember, OW is played by millions(according to blizz), this amount of people is near impossible to moderate by any practical amount of humans they can hire. So they have to do trades here and there. This is just a guess, but since there have been a lot of reports of automated bans, and the fact that it was confirmed by blizz its automated, it pretty much confirms what i think.

&gt; So no, I don't think I will be banned

If you do get banned for no apparent reason, please do tell me, ok?

&gt; And with respect, if you think Blizzard is lying to you about their relationship with their player base than why would you be playing their games?

Listen, i don't think of companies as of some criminals, i just buy the game and i don't even think who made it(unless its ubisoft and the game is multiplayer, fuck that game in that case). But that doesn't mean companies don't have some shady practices.

&amp;nbsp;

You know what i don't believe in? i don't believe that its humanly possible to moderate a player base of 25million without automatic handling of many thing. Including automatic banning. You know why? numbers, that simple.

&amp;nbsp;

If 1 in a 100 people is toxic(and lets be real, this number is WAAY higher) and he gets reported multiple times, thats 250k people out of 25kk that need to be banned. 

Now if bans are handled manually, and to ban someone you have to press one button(which is 100% more than one button, but lets say its 1 button for the sake of showing the magnitude of the problem here), this button must be pressed 250k times. 

Lets say they hire 100 people in tech support, at which point the tech support itself is already a quarter(maybe bigger?) than the whole OW team. Even then, every tech support employee has to press the ban button 2500 times. 

&amp;nbsp;

Have you tried pressing one button 2500 times? let alone, someone has to verify the ban claim, right? do you even comprehend how much time that would take? And this is not a one time thing, it happens all the time, bans expire and new bans arrive. 

&amp;nbsp;

You must be naive to think the system is not automated.",Overwatch

There are several types of FGM. The types most people immediately think of are as you describe - objectively different from male circumcision, and much worse.

There are other types that aren't different, and aren't worse, though. There's one sort that's removal of the clitoral hood only, which is exactly analogous to removal of the foreskin.

There are other types of FGM that are actually far less drastic than male circumcision. One, for example, involves a ""ceremonial pinprick"" or ""ceremonial scrape"" where a very small poke or scratch is done just to draw a drop of blood.

Nevertheless, people lump all FGM together under ""FGM"", and bans on the practice prohibit all sorts.

There are two ways to make things fair. Either we specifically prohibit the ""bad FGM"" and allow the ""less bad FGM"", or we extend the same sort of outrage and legislation to male circumcision as we already have for *all* FGM (both the severe types and the less severe ones).

http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/about-reports-pubs-military-law/military-justice-overview.page

&gt;The operational realities of military life mean that service members are often held to a higher standard of conduct than what would be expected of a civilian. Because military personnel are often required to risk injury or death in the performance of their duties, both inside and outside of Canada, the military justice system puts a premium on the necessity for discipline and for cohesion of military units.

&gt;Even though members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) are held to the highest standards of conduct, they do not give up the rights that are afforded to them under Canadian law, including under the Constitution.  Nonetheless, an individual’s rights can be limited where they are inconsistent with the basic obligations of military service.  The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) – as part of Canada’s Constitution – has primacy over the NDA and all other laws of Canada. However, section 1 of the Charter explicitly permits other Charter rights to be limited under certain circumstances.

I was wondering if you could give me some insight into max DPS for trash packs. When is it best to use beam, should I be using blade dance on CD or my cleave for more fragments and therefore more cleaves in meta window? 

Currently I've been dashing, demons bite for enough fury to Eye Beam and dropping artifact ability and doing one blade dance followed by cleaves until window is over. I could get two blade dances out in that window if possible though. Also, I feel like cleaves giving me fragments and reducing my eye beam CD means more uptime so maybe that's what's best?

Also, is there a useful alternative to momentum for this sort of build? I just dislike having to work position and timing around like that, especially for boss fights. I was thinking of using nemesis just to have a single-target cooldown for boss fights.

Currently, I'm only clearing +5-8s as I'm still gearing up and doing LFR (about 870 iLvl, no legendaries yet) but I figure best to ask and get set in the right ways before I get great gear and then am left to wonder what I should have been doing the whole time.

607,"&gt; Because the problem wasn't as obvious to lawmakers at the time. Technology is constantly changing, and it's only in recent years that the internet has become fast enough for companies like Netflix to emerge and become viable competitors for cable and satellite TV. Even outside of their feud with Netflix, they began throttling peer-to-peer transfer (torrents, online gaming), and began plans to intstitute data caps and allow ""preferred partners"" like The ISP's own video services or large companies that could afford the fee be exempt from them. Basically they started abusing their position more and more.

No. Netflix was throttled in 2012, not in 2015, the difference in technology and internet speeds in 2012 and 2015 is negligible.

&gt;I'd be interested to look this up because it's the first time I've heard this questions, but all I could really do is speculate. My suspicion is that there's more competition and/or less barriers to establish alternate routes if one company started throttling or sabotaging certain connections. It's possible that it's harder for them to get directly between a specific company and it's potential customers or less ability to profit from it.

Listening to the accents and words that people used back then was a pleasure even if the subject was disturbing. Parts reminded me of a series of books by Penn Jones Jr. an editor of the Midlothian Mirror, a local small town newspaper. He collected stories of eyewitnesses who were ignored or treated poorly by law enforcement and the Warren commission, and then died in obscure ways within a few years of the assassination. He published four installments of Forgive My Grief.  These books, because of their local view and simple narratives first convinced me that the Warren commission was bogus.
          Another emotional moment was when I went to the movie JFK in a Dallas area theater with a group of friends.It was a Sunday afternoon with less than half of the seats taken. At the end of the film no one in the theater would speak or look at each other. That experience led me to do a lot of reading on the topic. One of the best books I read was put together by a group of academics. Unfortunately I did not keep it nor do I remember the title. It was not a long book, around 200 pages, only 20 or so pages of introduction and explanation and the rest was speeches and articles from the times. The longest was a speech by Castro detailing the history of US intervention in Cuba since the revolution and his beliefs as to which parts of the shadow government took part in JFK's murder. Also included was the 'peace speech' JFK gave at a university commencement that spring. The first time I was aware of it, in that for me, pre-internet time. The focus of the book was not all the confusing details and minutiae of the event but the general tone of the times. It was convincing.

It would have been nice to keep Backes, and losing him definitely made us a worse team. But he wanted term, and he got a lot of it. I think Armstrong is building for another cup window in 2-4 years, and paying $6 million for a ~37 year old Backes in a few years would really work against us.

Brouwer wasn't that great to start with, and it seems like he's only gotten worse this season. I think we dodged a bullet by letting him go. 

Elliott specifically asked to be traded, and losing him has given Allen a chance to step up and develop his game more. It also gives us an open goalie spot this/next year for one of our goalie prospects to move up.

It sucked to lose all three players at the same time, but I think Armstrong wants to build a cup window around Tarasenko's prime.

921,"&gt;i know many people in their 20s and 30s that just won't do it.

This is such a pet peeve of mine when the older generations complain of Americans choosing not to marry or have children.  It's so myopic that no one is even considering the incentives upon incentives in our society **against having children** and getting married until well in your 30s, if you are lucky.

Let's start with the college debt that cannot be dismissed with bankruptcy.  More and more people are graduating 21-26 with hundreds of thousands in student loans.  They literally have monthly payments totaling a mortgage payment. So instead of purchasing a home together, more and more are doing the responsible thing and living with their parents or renting with multiple other people in the same situation. Not a good time to get married or have kids.

Then we have a poor economy with poor entry-level job prospects and no federal parental job protections. So the only job you can get is part time and you need it to, you know, eat and pay them student loans, but if you happen to get pregnant, you will definitely need to be out to be all lazy and lay on your back to give birth.  You may find yourself without a job to go back to and with an extra tiny mouth to feed. Not a good time to get married or have kids.

But that's okay because then we get to the lack of any federal program to provide assistance with early child care.  That's right. Even if your state has job protections for you to generously stay home with your newborn 6-12 weeks post partum, what happens after that? Child care is hella expensive. You or the baby daddy needs to make sure your tiny helpless child won't die while you try to earn enough to eat, and pay those student loans, oh and those medical bills. So one of you is going to be unemployed, and if you're breastfeeding and have said breasts, that's probably the only body part that will be working for the time being if you choose to have a child.  And that goes until pre-school or kindergarten with no public opinion to help with child care.  Not a good time to get married or have kids.

Oh, and our precarious health care situation! Let's not forget that! Even currently, under the ACA/Obamacare, not all insurance policies are created equal. Some carry huge deductibles that are back breakers all by themselves (in addition to the large, mandatory monthly fees that are the largest complaint against the ACA). And with the new bill, why, maternity might not even be covered if your state doesn't feel like it!  Not a good time to get married or have kids.

So many ""pro family"" advocacy groups are focused on abortion only or bemoaning how much fewer people in their 20s and 30s are getting married and having children for lack of Jesus when it's really just a matter of responsibility.  Of course the result of planning for children well into the late 30s and 40s are fertility problems and other complications.

TL;dr:  When these people say ""kids are too expensive,"" they are not just talking about the cost of diapers or missing out on European vacations.  They are talking about massive career and financial setbacks cause by our current economic circumstances and a lack of legislative incentives that promote families.",worldnews

1001,"There is loyalty in the NBA but there's a lot of factors in play where you can't use one factor in determining what is and isn't loyalty. I think it's all situational. I'm a Celtics fan and I'm not happy Bradley is gone. However, even before the draft, everyone knew he was too good to keep at a price the Celtics could afford while trying to improve with free agents. So getting something for Bradley instead of losing him in free agency next year makes perfect sense. That's the smartest thing to do in this case. I doubt they wanted to just outright part with Bradley because he was such a great player all around.

I think you can play the no loyalty card when a star player leaves after being offered a good contract to stay on a contending team. Ray Allen was a good example of this. We had everyone back from the previous year and he left for the Heat over, if I remember correctly, 2 million and 1 year difference during talks. We offered either the more money or the extra year. Again, Celtics fan, that's just an example that comes to my mind.

The Jazz, a few years ago, let Hayward try to find a better contract than he was asking for because they didn't think he was worth what he asked. When he couldn't find better they got him at what they wanted. If a team was willing to bet on you going to market, how can you blame him for wanting to go somewhere where the coach, team and fans really wanted him and are obviously giving a max contract? I know, another Celtics example, but I think it's still relevant and topical in this discussion.

Lastly, Paul Pierce. My favorite player. Love that guy. So sad to see him traded but again, it wasn't about loyalty. Pierce was not going to contribute the same way he always had and KG was getting injury prone. We were not getting better and we would only get worse going forward. Ainge traded them when he saw he could fleece the Nets big time. With their exit, we just got a great player in the draft and possibly more in the years to come because of that trade. It gave us something instead of nothing had we held on to Pierce and KG and just sucked or stayed average for multiple seasons. Pierce and KG still love Boston and Boston still loves them. Ainge talked with Pierce about the trade and Pierce had to convince KG it was OK and made sense because I think he had a no trade clause.

At the end of the day I think players should try and get the most for themselves in terms of money and success (NOT just money) and so should the teams themselves. Taking paycuts to stay with your team is obviously loyalty. Leaving a good team for a max contract to go to a shit team going nowhere, is more over the line of not being loyal and just being greedy. Yes I know sports players have a short career and should try to get the most money but I mean millions of dollars is  reasonable for any human being to live off of.",nba

After we had been friends for about a year, she totally flipped on me. All of a sudden I was a drama queen trying to rupture the guild because I didn't have a problem with our raiders seeing content with other raid teams, since we were not really a super progressive guild.

Come to find out, she was showing her tits to a majority of the males in the guild on Skype, and suddenly felt threatened by me, thinking I was trying to lure them away to start another guild/raid team.

http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/

&gt;A longstanding orthodoxy among social scientists holds that human races are a social construct and have no biological basis. A related assumption is that human evolution halted in the distant past, so long ago that evolutionary explanations need never be considered by historians or economists.

&gt;In the decade since the decoding of the human genome, a growing wealth of data has made clear that these two positions, never at all likely to begin with, are simply incorrect. There is indeed a biological basis for race. And it is now beyond doubt that human evolution is a continuous process that has proceeded vigorously within the last 30,000 years and almost certainly — though very recent evolution is hard to measure — throughout the historical period and up until the present day.

&gt;New analyses of the human genome have established that human evolution has been recent, copious, and regional. Biologists scanning the genome for evidence of natural selection have detected signals of many genes that have been favored by natural selection in the recent evolutionary past. No less than 14% of the human genome, according to one estimate, has changed under this recent evolutionary pressure.

&gt;Analysis of genomes from around the world establishes that there is a biological basis for race, despite the official statements to the contrary of leading social science organizations. An illustration of the point is the fact that with mixed race populations, such as African Americans, geneticists can now track along an individual’s genome, and assign each segment to an African or European ancestor, an exercise that would be impossible if race did not have some basis in biological reality.

I'm sorry, but you're wrong here. It is no worse for Israel to destroy these places militants use to attack civilians than for terrorists to use them to attack people. At least the Israelis bother to call the school, hospital, or home before they send a cruise missile through the front door. Terrorists don't afford that privilege to their victims.

As for the comparison to Nazi Germany, I think it is completely fair to compare cowards to cowards. As the Nazis were being pushed back they brought the injured and ill, the women and children, and the civilians out to use as human shields. Like the terrorists that fire rockets, mortars, rifles and guns into Israel the Nazis in WWII then took the stories of the Allies inadvertently killing some human shields and used that for their propaganda. They used it like the terrorists in Palestine use it to try and claim that it is not them who are doing the bad thing by using human shields but it is those trying to defend against their heinous crimes that are to blame.

The only people to blame in Palestine when a school, a home, a hospital, or a market gets blown up because it was used as a site to attack civilians are those who made the conscientious decision to turn what should be a peaceful civilian place into a legitimate military target.",canada

&gt; Glassjaw is a highly influential post-hardcore band from Long Island, NY.  They formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp.  They recorded some demos before releasing the EP ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in 1997, and recorded their first full length album ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence"" in 2000 on Roadrunner Records.  The record brought the band out of Long Island and into the hands of a dedicated grass-roots following. The band has been influential in the progression of the underground music scene in the eastern United States and United Kingdom and on the post-hardcore genre, and are known for their intense live shows and constant line-up changes.

&gt; Their sophomore album ""Worship and Tribute"" was released in 2002 on Warner Brothers Records.   Although it received some MTV airtime, a Grammy nomination and a peak at #82 on the Billboard top 200, ""Worship and Tribute"" was a departure from the debut and was met with mixed reviews from fans.  Since then, Glassjaw have not recorded any new material, releasing the digital-only EP ""El Mark"" in 2005, a release that consisted of three unused songs from the ""Worship and Tribute"" sessions.

&gt; In 2005, all members spare Palumbo and Beck left the band for reasons which remain unclear.  It is supposed that they left involuntarily.  Ex-drummer Durijah Lang and ex-bass player Manuel Ragoonanan Carrero were soon inducted back into the band, so there was once again a functional lineup for playing shows.  Indeed, the new four-piece Glassjaw played a handful of shows in Summer 2005.  A new album was apparently in the works for a release in 2007, but never surfaced.

&gt; Daryl Palumbo also fronts electronic pop-rock band Head Automatica, and ex-Glassjaw drummer Larry Gorman also played for them; however, Gorman is no longer a member of the band for unknown reasons.

&gt; Ex-guitarist Todd Weinstock now plays in the similarly-styled band Men, Women, &amp; Children.

&gt; After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005, two at the now-defunct The Downtown in Farmingdale, NY, with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on The Used's tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom.

&gt; After some mysterious updates on their website, the 2007 Glassjaw tour had gone and ended, already hitting up spots including yet another venue in Farmingdale, NY, playing 2 shows in one day at The Crazy Donkey.

&gt; Glassjaw's next album is highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July, 2006 issue of AP magazine, he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album. In November, 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written ""about eleven good songs -- seven i love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish"".

&gt; In an interview with Kerrang!, Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by ""The end of this year or early 2009...I hope."" Details emerged from The Grixer in May, 2008 that the album was ""awaiting vocals"" and ""should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months"". In a May, 2008 interview with Verse One magazine, Beck said: ""Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record. I’m sure if it’s not a giant pile of shit, we’d love to play it live. Exact dates, plans, don’t know yet."" In a June, 2008 interview conducted by Glassjaw.net, Beck stated, ""As far as I am personally concerned, there will be a release well before the end of the year.""

&gt; On August 6–8, 2010, the band released a 7"" vinyl single for ""All Good Junkies Go to Heaven"" spraypainted green and pink on either side of the vinyl at the UK's Hevy Fest. This is the first official Glassjaw release since 2005's El Mark EP[/album. On August 8, 2010 via MerchDirect, ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" became available for purchase. Within hours of availability, the vinyl had sold out. Shortly thereafter, in addition to the launch of the single, a ""one-take"" live video of their 2008 song ""You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)"" was posted on the official Glassjaw website. On September 8, Glassjaw announced the release of another vinyl single for release on September 9, 2010 for the song ""Jesus Glue"", as well as a digital download for ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" in various formats. On September 23, GlassJaw posted a video for the song, ""Stars"", a reworked version of ""Star Above my Bed"", a fan favorite. As they did with ""Junkies"" and ""Jesus Glue,"" October 10 saw the release of yet another vinyl, ""Natural Born Farmer"" and the digital release of ""Jesus Glue.""

&gt; At 11:11AM on January 11, glassjaw.com began streaming a studio recording of ""Gold"". The website's background was changed to a live band photo with the text ""coloring book, the extended play. available exclusively at venue. gratis."" After the first concert on their 2011 tour, February 13, 2011, the new EP Coloring Book was given away free to each fan that attended the concert. Glassjaw played two shows in the UK, at the London HMV Forum (March 30) and the Cardiff Solus (March 31), with support from Napalm Death and also headlined Soundfest (June 10), playing alongside other artists such as Brother Ali, Del the Funky Homosapien and If He Dies He Dies. The band also played the Radio 1 / NME Stage at Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2011.

&gt; Glassjaw played their first and only scheduled show so far in 2012 in support of Rise Against's Endgame tour. It was the only show Glassjaw opened for them on the tour. A Day To Remember, The Menzingers, Architects, Touché Amoré, and Title Fight are also supporting selected dates. Glassjaw have been added to the Sonisphere festival line-up and will perform Worship &amp; Tribute in its entirety during their set. However, it was announced on March 29, 2012 via Sonishere's website that the festival was canceled due to issues in setting up the festival. As a result, the band have scheduled a date at New York's Irving Plaza to play the album in its entirety. The band have also been announced to be playing Hevy Festival 2012, alongside acts such as Converge, Rolo Tomassi and Will Haven. This will mark Glassjaw's second time playing at the festival, and the first since headlining it in 2010. Read more on Last.fm.

1136,"You get more out of cheap immigrant labour, out of better and easier access to former soviet markets, and out of a stronger EU as a whole (not to mention other positives). The countries you wish to swap with already have this, and can't compete with your goods in the first place. These all benefit, in your case, Swedish companies and the benefits flow through to the Swedish economy and the Swedish people. It's much harder to measure because it's not the direct money that you're giving to them, but it does have a significant benefit. Most of the money that goes to Italy, for example, goes to the southern regions because they are as poor as those of the former eastern bloc, and the countries such as portugal, greece and spain have been poorer than those of Northern Europe for most of the last 50 years at least (longer even I'd guess) and the same applies to them as to the former soviet countries, except on a smaller scale. 

I haven't read much about this extra 30% over 7 years, so I can't comment unfortunately, but hopefully you can see from what I've written above that it will end up benefiting Sweden and other contributing countries, if not immediately than in the long run.

Yes, joining the euro now is a stupid idea. But these benefits flow through to the entire European economy where there is free movement of goods, capital and people. I imagine at some stage Sweden will probably join the Eurozone which benefits to a greater degree than non-eurozone countries from these effects. You have to remember the Euro is very new and is the most sophisticated, advanced currency of its kind. It's an experiment (one currency for so many different and varied countries?) that has never been tried before, and as with most experiments it takes a little while to fix all the problems, so it is unsurprising that such problems would arise.

As for the retirement age, the whole ""greeks retire at 55"" thing is a myth that has already been disproven, they work just as hard as other countries. Why should you pay more than you already are? It's an investment that will pay off FAR more if you stick with it than what you put in. It's the only way I can see of keeping Europe as an important player in global trade over the 20th century. Yes some countries might mismanage their finances, but that is why the EU is constantly evolving to try and stop such problems happening.

&gt; By a man wearing a dress, he does not change the fact he has a dick between his legs.

Here's the thing. His GENDER is what is PERCEIVED by SOCIETY. How often do you see strangers' hanging dicks in a day? If a man in a dress looks and sounds and behaves like a woman because they identify as a woman, then as far as you are concerned their gender is a woman. Until you are in the most intimate of situations, you would not know their sex. Hell, if a woman is unfortunate enough to be born with severely masculine features but still identifies as a woman, is it our right to question whether or not she's secretly a man in a dress? It doesn't MATTER to you what they have, because it doesn't AFFECT you unless you're fucking them. But it MATTERS to them how they're identified, because genders are treated differently and they don't want to be treated in a way that makes them immensely uncomfortable.",funny

Out of his 19 starts, he's given up 2 ER or less in 11 of them. If you take out the dreadful starts, that's only 5 below average starts, which I could live with from a 35 year old guy. 

In addition, he's posted his highest K/9 since '13. Without stats to back me up on this (just going off memory), it seems like most of his runs are given up by walking a guy or two and then letting up a homer since his BB/9 and HR/9 are all career highs.

Looking at his pitch/fx data, it looks like his success depends on the movement of his curve (surprise, surprise). His velo for his curve is also down about 5mph since his peak, but he's also losing about 1-2"" of horizontal run of his curve while his other pitches remain the same. He's also losing about 1-2"" of vert movement from his curve. In turn, this makes it less deceptive which generates more takes, which equals more walks.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-advisory-commission-election-integrity-resources

https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/comments-received-07122017.pdf

Here are the public comments, if you read them, it's the same exact canned message, I doubt these are even real people.

Something stinks.

&gt;Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity Dear Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, I am deeply concerned that the Pence-Kobach commission's recent request for private information about every voter in the country could be the first of many attempts to push nationwide voting restrictions. I'm glad that state election officials have put their duty to voters above this partisan attack on voters, and I want you to know that the American people will not be intimidated out of exercising our freedom to vote. The best way to uphold the integrity of our elections is by making sure every eligible voter can vote and have their vote counted as cast -- not using false claims about illegal voting to suppress votes. Modernizing our elections to allow things like automatic voter registration, Election Day voter registration, and early voting are important steps to lowering the barriers to participation for all Americans. The freedom to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and I know that We The People will do whatever it takes, together, to protect it. I will not let this Commission intimidate me or any other eligible American from exercising the freedom to vote.

This same comment is copy pasted all the way down the line. Something definitely stinks.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/comments-received-07112017.pdf

The president is colluding with MSM to make him seem like a bad guy and get more attention, a narcissist of the highest order and the MSM gets ratings. That's the real collusion.

If you keep following this rabbit hole, you see that the organization responsible for these canned comments is called ""Common Cause"" it's a sham organization funded by Soros.

They have a Reddit sub that's been inactive for 3 years

This is the exact same canned response that's been copypasta'd all the way down the line.

It gives you the option to personalize it, funny no one bothered to.

It also makes you put in all your personal information, so it's not the white house compelling people to put their personal information it's this copy pasta shit that does it on their behalf.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1234,"Hook accuracy here: http://overprogress.com/rating/Roadhog/Hook+Accuracy/6

The thing about the hook accuracy is that you don't strictly need to kill them with the combo for it to have done anything. The stun interrupts ults, and even if you're not interrupting ults, you still repostitioned the enemy which is a big deal completely on its own because you almost always guarantee that *someone* on your team kills them even if it's not you.

And that's the hook on its own. Again, you don't need the hook to one shot! Even in the instances where the hook is on cooldown, left clicks on nearby targets during team fights or right clicks during initiations is typically sufficient and yes was very consistent. That was just too much firepower from someone so hard to kill. The nerf was necessary. A buff is also necessary. But that damage had to go one way or another.",Overwatch

1298,"&gt; he's walked at a fantastic rate his MLB career and he's shown elite power. Things Anderson never has

Wow a DH and SS have different skill sets...

&gt;He has legit promise to be an above average major leaguer, and selling him now would be at a low point. I don't believe Anderson has that same potential and could continue playing poorly, only hurting his trade value further

Anderson has more promise than Schwarber in my opinion, in 173 games Anderson has a career WAR of 2.7, compared to Schwarber's .5 in 135. Schwarber is just a bat in the NL, he can't field, he can't run, he can just hit, and right now he's not doing the good of a job. Anderson needs work but to give up on him in the next 2 years is dumb, when he's showed a lot of promise last year.

It also depends on if the opponent(s) in your lane has recalled or not. If they have already recalled and came back with one or more items it is going to be harder for you to lane against them. You always want to keep the advantage in your lane.

If the enemy comes back with items that give them the advantage you may find that you start losing the lane.

 I've had this happen to me many times. I zone the enemy out and they recall and come back with a couple new items. This gives them the advantage but I stubbonly think I can hold out against them because hey after all I've got full health and half mana.

But it's the process, or lack thereof, and the poor transparency that's a concern, at least for some of us little c conservatives.  A process that would have likely resulted in some tough questions being asked of those in power from 2002-2004.  By just bypassing it entirely that doesn't look that great and it shouldn't be surprising that people are a little miffed by it.

There's still people who are blaming the tories for this despite them having no legal or constitutional culpability at all with respect to Khadr's rights having been violated.  A public inquiry or trial would have given the public a deeper understanding of what exactly happened.

In short, or to reclarify, I personally don't have an issue with the amount or that he received it; but I do take issue with the manner in which this settlement was reached and bypassing public scrutiny by not having conducted a public commission or trial to expunge Khadr's conviction, even if that conviction is very dubious.

1567,"Driving safely requires processing a shitton of information. The more you do it, the better your brain gets at automating parts of that processing, like tracking your speed or the locations of cars around you, but when you first start driving you have to do that all manually, you probably literally cannot track everything you should be, even if you feel like you can, and even with lots of experience it won't be effortless and you will still be taxing your resources pretty heavily when you drive. In light of that fact, you should be always seek to minimize distractions, this is incredibly important for your first few thousand hours behind the wheel, but really you should try to reduce distractions while driving until the day you die. So...

1. Don't talk on the phone, even with a hands-free device, unless it is truly an emergency - the person on the other end doesn't know what is going on around you so they don't know when to shut the fuck up and let you think, and if they are talking they are tying up resource you might need to avoid death or injury.

2. Don't take your eyes off the road for any longer than you absolutely have to. That means that when you check your blind spot, you do it fast, it means you don't fiddle with the radio unless you are at a dead stop and even then do it as fast as possible and get your eyes back on the road and your mirrors.

3. If you are impaired in *any way*, avoid driving if at all possible. Obviously this means don't drive drunk, but it also means don't drive angry if you can avoid it, don't drive tired (seriously, don't drive tired. You drive about as well after being awake for 24 hours as you do after chugging a beer. Make it 30 hours and you are up to multiple beers) don't drive if you are in significant pain if you can avoid it, etc. Call a cab if you have to, try to adjust your schedule to make sure it doesn't happen often, etc.

4. If you are a new driver, any time you *aren't* driving you should be practicing the more passive parts of driving. Keep track of where cars around you are (you'll be surprised, your brain can keep track of things that pass in and out of view very well with practice. You should eventually be able to identify the location of every car within 20 feet of you in any direction without checking mirrors, just based on where they were when you last saw them in a mirror and how fast they appeared to be going. You should never *assume* that you are correct, but you should always be tracking.)",AskReddit

1651,"Just had some counter-arguments I wanted to make.

&gt; Dany's dragons and her large army didn't help her much in Meereen so they are less effective at subduing a population than one would suspect.

This is saying a lot without really providing context. The problem with Meereen was how they were attacked. Also, Dany and co. didn't actually *know* the enemy, in the sense that they didn't *know* where/who to attack to stop it. Once they did, Dany burnt their fleet to the ground and killed 3 of their leaders. Pretty damn effective, if you ask me.

Unlike Meereen, Dany is going into the battle knowing who the enemy is, and the enemy isn't going to be able to hide in the shadows for long. Cersei will be forced to address Dany.

&gt; Wage a propaganda campaign against the Targaryens. Make Dany into a foreigner and a tyrant seeking to subjugate and oppress Westeros. Remind people of Dany's cray-cray father. Heck, blame Varys or Tyrion or some Targ loyalists for burning the Sept to the ground.

First off, no one in King's Landing considers Cersei in a positive manner. The general populace loathes her, and know the real kind of danger they are in with her at the helm. To suggest she could spin some shit to make the rightful Queen, who carries titles such as the Breaker of Chains, into a bad person, is just silly. Also, that isn't Cersei's style. She doesn't give a fuck what the public thinks of her, and loathes them equally as intensely as they for her. She'd rather burn them all then try and play some petty little opinion game. 

This isn't High School; Dany has fucking fire-breathing dragons. The popular kid doesn't win here.

&gt; Ally with Euron and have him raid Dany's allies in Dorne and the Reach. Make it impossible for them to aid Dany because they have to defend their territories. Make both kingdom's banners, especially the Reach's banners, restless and ready to turn on Elia/Sandsnakes and Oleanna Tyrell. Promise lands to any defectors.

Totally reasonable. Euron is obviously aiding her, and the trailer suggests he's attacking them in open water. There is far too much to be gained by trying to disrupt Dany's allies while she is still traveling/plotting. This is the most logical move, and the most likely to happen. I see her trying to split Dany's group as soon as possible.

&gt; Ally with the North. Give Jon what he wants, men to defend the Wall. Sign a non-aggression pact with the North which acknowledges their independence. This will mean that Dany has to fight a war on two fronts; she would have to subdue the North as well because she wants everyone in Westeros to kneel to her. (Of course, Cersei won't do this either for the same power-hungry reason. I don't think that Tywin would either. However, a more reasonable Lannister like Tyrion or Kevan probably would see the value in making this move.)

That will never happen. Both sides are far too gone for such a truce, particularly when the obvious choice for Jon and the North would be to aid with the chick who has dragons, and who's ancestors allowed the Starks to rule the North after the Targs took control of Westeros.


Truth be told, Cersei and the Lannisters are a sinking ship. It would take a fucking miracle to revive them now, and even a further miracle to see them survive the shit storm coming their way. Cersei's diversion/division tactics will certainly have some effect, and Cersei will obviously gain some small victories, but Dany's dragons trump it all. Even with just Drogon, who is now a certified fucking monster, she can turn the tide in her favor to tremendous effect. The fact she obviously still had enough men to have the Doth Raki in open battle in one of those scenes, shows that the division tactic probably didn't do enough to stop what is coming for Cersei.

Honestly, Cersei's only chances for survival/victory hinge on what happens in the North, or if Euron *actually* has a Dragon Horn. At this point, it seems reasonable to believe that Euron has a horn, but what it will actually do in the show versus what it is said to do in the book, make it hard to really tell where they are going with it.

Finally, Cersei has the option to level the city with wildfire. It isn't below her to hold the city and it's people hostage, knowing the importance that Dany places in saving innocent lives. I'd be more inclined to believe that Cersei will level the city rather than give it up to Dany. It makes me wonder if Arya could have a part to play in that sequence of events that will lead up to Cersei's downfall, and Dany's eventual taking of King's Landing. Arya would fulfill the theory of her being the one to kill Cersei as per the prophecy from that crazy witch, and would give a smooth transition into an alliance for a bigger cause between the North and Dany.

Anyway, getting off topic now. Just wanted to share my thoughts on why Cersei is backed into a corner and not likely to get out, even if she causes massive damage and loss of life in the interim. ",gameofthrones

1713,"&gt;you can observe plenty of people with multiple mastery pages in a climate where it's not required since you can edit them in champ select

Ya and I don't think many people at all would pay for mastery pages. The main argument here isn't that what was paid for is now 'cheaper' (I'm not even sure there will be any change in the pricing of rune pages, at least not that I've seen), that means absolutely nothing to me. It's the fact that what I bought is not what i'm getting anymore. It would be like if I bought a TV from a store, used it for a year, and then the guy who sold me the TV said, ""Hey, we're just gonna take your TV and give you a worse one, don't worry you got your moneys worth from the other one, and this one works just fine!"".

To reiterate, the issue isn't that the things I bought have decreased in value, that's to be expected, anyone who buys anything should understand that it won't be worth as much in the future, but instead the concern is the fact that I am literally no longer getting the product I purchased. The only reason (most) people buy rune pages is because you can't change them in champ select, If you couldn't change masteries in champ select people would buy extras of those too, but since you can pretty much no one would. What people paid for, either with IP or RP, was the ability to have more options going into games, and there is no reason other than convenience to have multiple rune pages when you can change them in champion select.

I'll agree 100% that the change to runes is a good one, but I think everyone should be given 20 rune pages (just like masteries) and people who bought pages should be given some form of compensation, not full compensation because that's ridiculous, but some form nonetheless.",leagueoflegends

1725,"&gt;re prohibitions: fine then let's un ban all drugs ... not just pot ... why stop there after all?

Yes, that's what they've done in Portugal and Germany and Holland, and a few other places. It's been shown time and time again, the prohibition of drugs causes more problems than the drugs themselves. Overdoses, and side effects like losing all your hair and teeth, etc are caused by dirty impure drugs. Violence is caused by dealer's turf wars. Addicts steal to feed their habit because the prices are inflated astronomically by the black market. Heroin actually has no real side effects on the body, you could do heroin every day for the rest of your life and pretty much the worst that would happen is you'd get constipated. Meth is safe enough under a doctor's supervision that we currently prescribe it to children as young as six. The drugs don't cause any of the problems you associate with drug use. The prohibition causes all of these problems.

Have you studied anything about the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920's? As soon as alcohol was made illegal, huge violent criminal gangs popped up, making millions of dollars off the black market. Alcohol consumption went *UP*, showing that the threat of punishment did not discourage anyone from using it, in fact it only popularized it. People died from improperly distilled alcohol, or alcohol that was contaminated with other liquids - people would add antifreeze to gin to make an extra buck, just like dealers cut heroin with clorox today. The prohibition caused astounding amounts of violence, crime, and deaths, while alcohol use rose considerably. As soon as prohibition was ended, many cartels disbanded, alcohol use dropped, violent crime dropped, and people stopped being poisoned by bathtub gin. Likewise, in any country where drugs have been legalized and regulated, use has dropped, violence has dropped, crime has dropped, overdose deaths have dropped, HIV and other bloodborne disease transmission rates have dropped. 

It's not a matter of ""different cultures do things differently"", it's retardedly obvious that the black market causes all these multitudes of problems, which we spend billions each year fighting. Problems we created in the first place. In the early part of the century anyone could go to the drug store and buy all the cocaine or heroin they wanted, and while yes, there were some people who struggled with addiction, we never had any of the street violence and people breaking into cars and overdose victims dying on the streets that we have now.

The devs seem to think this game will go on for many years; that's understandable, since they're the ones behind this, and they likely want to keep it going for as long as possible. They also want people to think and feel like it's going to go on for a while, too, which is important: once people start thinking en masse 'yeah, Overwatch is starting to die', the vibe may spread fast and people may gravitate away from it as the 'feeling' that it's dying / dead sits, regardless of what the devs may be doing at the time to try to keep the game fresh and interesting. 

Overwatch has been in people's sight and minds since launch; since way before launch, really. The game itself and everything surrounding it has been going very strong for the last year and almost a month. However, some people have already shown signs of fatigue (some of those who played from launch and finally got tired from playing too often, those who see it everywhere and just weren't much a fan to begin with and want it out of their faces, etc.). It's hard to say if those kinds of people are even having that big of an impact on people's views and opinions of the game. 

I'd like to think that it'll last for a long time; I just don't know what 'a long time' is, and it's weird trying to pinpoint that. Part of me feels like it'll last a year more; part of me feels like it very well could go for a couple more years. I really don't know. There's too many variables to keep note of to accurately say how long it'll last. 

When I said 'we could use 2-3 more healer heroes over the course of the game's lifespan', that was me assuming it'd go for another, say, 2-3 years max.

1973,"After reading this article the first time, I absolutely noticed little things that changed when I did things like switch to the D&amp;B purse my mom offered me or throw out the comfortable, well worn converse and buy a new pair which I sprayed with some protective coating to keep them looking nice and not ratty. I take the time now to clean off a pair of shoes in the bathroom if something gets on them. I got rid of a ton of my beloved but well worn or second hand clothes that I got only because they were cheap and went on a hunt to replace them with fewer well made, pricier, distinct looking pieces. I've heard people referring to others by the brands they've seen them wear. I've noticed the difference in attention that alumni pay me at networking events at my university. 

I'm lucky in that I've been solidly middle class my whole life. I was raised by a man who's had a job at the same company for going on 40 years, who had the fear of god about poverty put into him early by parents who survived the great depression, meaning he saved every way he could and taught me the importance of frugality while always being there with a handout when frugality just wasn't enough to cover my rent or car or gas for that month. I've worked since I was a teenager and always avoided asking for help, but he's been there and he gave me a hand in buying a house when no one my age has one. It's not because I work harder than other people, I've just been lucky and that frugality has been a big help in getting me into a financial security at an early age that is not accessible to most people.

But what I didn't learn from him was the power of status symbols, because I went without in so many ways. I've had people who were initially interested stop talking to me when they see my iPhone 4S that I'm convinced still only works on my sheer disdain for apple products. I agree when you say fuck these people: I'm trying to find ways to support ethical companies but I prefer buying the throw aways that are other people's trash. I don't like buying new and contributing to consumerism. But at the same time, what I've also realized is that the ability to actually have these economic principles and make decisions based on them is itself a sort of privilege. Poor people don't get to have economic or social principles because they are given circumstances and regardless of what they'd like to do or how they'd like the world to be, their priority is survival and growth where they can get it. I'm likely never going to be poor: that's because of the luck of having no terrible diseases and some generational wealth that has created a comfy safety net for me. I could go about being an ethical consumer of only second hand goods and not worry about what people think when I wear clothing that is on it's last leg.  

But I have realized that if I want these aspects of society to change, it will have to be from within that social setting: You have to show people you can be a part of their social image successfully before they will give your opinions enough credence where it might influence them. So I may be doing what I consider an ethical thing by only buying unwanted and used crap from craigslist, but I will be much less likely to change this system that screws people over and reinforces poverty, desperation, and wealth inequality and disparity by shunning status symbols and the people who use them.  I will consider myself successful if I can do *something* with all my luck and privilege to break down some of these systems because the truth is, the people who must actually change these things often won't even give poor people respect, much less a chance to plead a case for themselves. If I can do one thing to convince someone of power or influence to actually listen to poor people instead of lecturing them about what they, as never-been-poor people think they should do, then it will be worth it.",AskReddit

&gt; Spiritualized are an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.

&gt; The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, Lazer Guided Melodies), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in The Breeders (and later Lupine Howl), Refoy formed Slipstream(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married Richard Ashcroft of The Verve. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed Lupine Howl following summary dismissal by Pierce.

&gt; Sax player Ray 'Moonshake' Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998.

&gt; Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former Julian Cope string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of Brain Donor and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz Solar Fire Trio. The remaining line-up finished recording the album Songs In A&amp;E in Nottingham and London.

&gt; The musical style of Spiritualized can perhaps be best described as psychedelic rock, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album Loveless. The landmark Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space showed influences from African-American gospel and blues beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from Phil Spector and Brian Wilson began to predominate, which came to a head on Let It Come Down. Amazing Grace favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences heavier than ever.

&gt; For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized's then-label, Arista Records.

&gt; On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records' Manchester nightclub The Haçienda.

&gt; After several years of work and Pierce's serious illness in July 2005,the album, Songs in A&amp;E was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was ""Soul On Fire"". The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May. Pierce has also scored Harmony Korine's 2008 film Mister Lonely.

&gt; In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.

&gt; After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, Sweet Heart Sweet Light was released in April 2012, on Double Six Records. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word ""Huh?"" on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would ""embrace"" more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety.

Ive friends from England who went to Cancun and asked me if all of Mexico is like that and no, it isnt as beautiful, or expensive, I mean all you have to do to realise is drive a couple of kilometers into Mexico and you will see where all the workers in Cancun live, that city is a lot more representative, thats all I was trying to say, obviously Cancun is part of Mexico but its nothing like the average town.",Music

10 minutes is about how long an average person who doesn't think there is reason to hurry would take in a bathroom after they stopped at a gas station.

A mild accident like the person slipping in the store, or even someone engaging them in conversation for a few minutes can add several minutes unto an initially poor estimate of how long one will be away.

And kids can get pretty engrossed in video games while heat is one of those things that can sneak up on your brain without triggering any alarms if you are busy with something else.

http://heatkills.org/how-hot/

I mean in practical terms, the discussion can be translated to ""can I leave my kids inside a human sized baking oven, set to mere 40C, while I run out for a few minutes""

edit: second issue here is that people rely on measures like cracked windows or even fully open windows but they don't realize how much wind speed and direction matters for that to make a difference. One could open all 4 windows fully and think the car is safe for a quick shopping trip but than a cloud moves out of the sunlight, wind dies down or changes direction and the cooling effect from the windows becomes negligible, while the car's body is still cooking.

Sort of like opening the door in your oven doesn't make the inside of that oven safe for your kids to climb in. ",canada

lol you jumped into an argument about those ""caricature LeBron stan"" points a day late, and reiterated some of those points, and are now acting bewildered like I'm strawmanning you

&gt; Saying Jordan didn't play anyone in the Finals as good as the '14 Spurs isn't even that controversial. Every team coming out of the West since 2012 is better than any team Jordan met in the Finals.

""[Jordan's] opponents were all weak!""

&gt; The only team back then that was stacked similarly to the superteams of today was Jordan's own team.

""Jordan's teams were unfairly stacked!""

&gt; The times are just different now and teams need more to win now than they did then.

""LeBron's... always faced historic superteams!""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; And I'm well aware who Jordan played in the Finals.

* I kinda doubt that, or you wouldn't make blanket statements about every team from the West 2012 and on has been better than them. and would respond to the Sonics and Jazz with smthg more substantive than ""but muh Hawks""

* those Hawks were crippled in the playoffs. a 60 win team with historic attributes (all-time D, HOF players) making the Finals means something. and shouldn't be off-handedly dismissed as weaker than any of the 5 Finals opponents LeBron lost to.

&amp;nbsp;

* counting rings and Finals is stupid. except when his 8 Finals and 7 straight are LeBron's greatest achievement, and the central reason this GOAT talk is happening in the first place

* and rings do make a HUGE difference when considering the huge asymmetry of the conferences. when your path to the Finals is thru smthg like the 5th, 8th, and 16th best teams, it matters when you consistently lose to the one top 4 team you face.

&amp;nbsp;

I know all about Jordan's ""mountains of accomplishments."" this is not an intelligent conversation appreciating history and doing a deep-dive resume comparison.

this you off-handedly insisting every Finals opponent LeBron has faced is better than any of Jordan's, without backing it up whatsoever.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ca8ac8a2eaff47f6966b3c47fca4bc03.png)  

&gt; John Miles (born John Errington, 23 April 1949, Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, England) is an English rock music vocalist, songwriter, guitarist and keyboard player, best known for his 1976 Top 3 UK hit single, Music

&gt; He was a member of groups ""The Influence"", which also included Paul Thompson, later drummer with Roxy Music and Vic Malcolm, later vocalist with Geordie and ""The John Miles Set,"" before starting his solo career in 1971. During the 1970s he issued 18 singles and four albums, including ""Rebel"" (1976), ""Stranger In The City"" (1977), and ""Zaragon"" (1978). He had most success with singles; in addition to Music, he also charted with ""Highfly"" (1975), ""Remember Yesterday"" (1976), and ""Slow Down"" (1977). Most of his songs were co-written with his bassist Bob Marshall.

&gt; Miles has toured with Tina Turner, often filling in for Bryan Adams when the latter was unavailable to join her on tour for their duet. Miles is also a frequent guest vocalist on albums by The Alan Parsons Project.

&gt; In the 1980s he continued to record and tour. In 1983 a new radio station in the south of England, Radio Mercury, used parts from the song ""Music"" for their link jingles. The actual song itself also received extensive airplay on the station, leading one to speculate this was perhaps part of a deal for the usage in their jingles.

&gt; A list of Miles album releases from the 1980s and 1990s is as follows:
Sympathy (1980) 
Miles High (1981) 
John Miles' Music (1982) 
Play On (1983) 
Transition (1985) 
John Miles Live In Concert (1992) 
Anthology (1993) 
Upfront (1993) 
Master Series (1998) 
Tom and Catherine (1999) 
Millennium Edition (1999)

&gt; Throughout the late 80s and into the 90s John Miles was musical director to Tina Turner on her various tours, and played on several of her albums. He also played Hammond organ on Joe Cocker's album ""Night Calls""(1992). Today he is still making music, which he famously refers to as his ""first love"".

&gt; In 2002 he issued the DVD ""John Miles - Live In Concert."" Read more on Last.fm.

Do you sell him the guns? Knowing that he might turn-around and hold you up, or use them to kill some of your friends?

* If your aim is good enough to win a majority of 1v1 duels then you need to focus on playing a more selective map pool and learning a few smokes/pop-flashes for these maps. 

* Recognize common spots where you die from consistently (ex. Awper playing fence on Cache) and learn how to smoke off these spots.

* Most common advise is that you should be able to frag your way out of Nova, but truthfully not everybody can frag-out or be a DM gym rat. Sometimes it is best to learn proper utility usage even in lower ranks - be a team player and help your teammates get their frags as well.

At the end of the day, you should enjoy playing at your rank - in my experience Nova isn't hell at all compared to Silver ranks. I actually really enjoyed my time at those ranks, it was usually chill pugs.",GlobalOffensive

I then did a like a low double digit parse on Avatar because where it drops you in DfA is craziness and I wasn't prepared on how to plan around the pools n such.

So, Sub has been popular enough and ToS has been open enough that the people that logging the fights are generally familiar with the spec and understand the windows to do damage.

Caitlyn placing a trap at the turret has zero risk and all reward at the expense of the opposing laners will to live. The fact that it's actually invisible on top of all this creates unfair situations where your trying to safely grab cs under tower whilst knowing a trap is there but unable to see it. The fact it's invisible means you cannot utilise the space around the turret/trap efficiently.

&gt;In two separate decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Canadian interrogations violated Khadr’s Charter rights and that the information derived from that illegal interrogation contributed to Khadr’s then seemingly indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay.  
  
&gt;Khadr then sued the government for $20 million in compensation for the wilful violation of his Charter rights, negligent investigation, conspiracy with the United States in his arbitrary detention, torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of mental distress and failure to comply with domestic and international human rights obligations.

We opted for cremation with no urn (we're going to scatter her ashes) and a simple memorial service without any bells and whistles, no catering, no speeches, no A/V, a single flower arrangement, the standard guestbook, etc. The funeral people were a bit perplexed by how secular and barebones (er, heh) it was, but they never tried to upsell us. 

On the day of the service, another family had a large and elaborate funeral for their young son. They had probably more than 150 guests, lots of flower arrangements, lots of food. The difference between my mom's funeral and the young man's was very pronounced despite our having been exposed to the same ""salespeople."" I doubt that the morticians pushed them into spending money they didn't want to spend. Some people are comforted by a more ornate funeral.

2368,"I think Belotti and Morata have been playing at the top level for more or less the same amount of time if I'm not mistaken. I don't watch either player's team so I don't have much to refer to other than stats but Morata broke into the Madrid team 13/14 (had 12 appearance in 12/13 and then 23 in 13/14) when belotti went to Palermo, which is obviously not at the same level but he did get the same amount of games (and i'd wager more minutes).

Thats a fair point and I can't really refute it because I don't watch enough Juve to really say either but I'm not particularly convinced by Morata either from what I've seen of him, not sure if he can make the move to a higher level and be the main man (he was definitely second choice to Benzena and as far as I know played most of the games against lesser sides). Tbh I would be happy with either of them being signed by Chelsea and I was under the false impression that Belotti was 2/3 years younger than Morata as opposed to just the 1 so it is much closer than i previously thought. 

Edit- Although there is definitely an argument to be made in Morata's favour, despite not making many appearances before 13/14 season, he did still have some with the Madrid senior team and presumably trained with the one of the best teams in the world with some of the best staff in the world, and similarly at Juve.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

&gt; In recent years, Chinese scientists have attributed extreme weather patterns in China, and especially in northern China, to climate change.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*!

Anything beyond that I would consider overkill for myself, but there are certainly plenty of other things you could do to try and farm those legendaries.

I would agree that there is a bit of a tacit understanding that those who are behind should put in a bit of extra effort  to keep up.  Your DPS numbers are not bad for the content, but our equivalent ilvl DPS are pulling 900k-1mil DPS pretty consistently, so that may have something to do with your guild issues.  I know Ret is very reliant on ideal legendaries, so that may be something you should focus more on, but I completely understand how soul crushing that can be.

I think overall the guild is just not a good fit for you.  As a busy adult, it can be very hard to find a good guild that fits your schedule and understands your priorities.  It sounds like you and the guild just aren't quite on the same page.",wow
2744,"While these numbers are true, the league and each franchise doesn't actually make as much money as these numbers would have you believe. 

**More games =/= more money**

I read somewhere a few years ago that only 8 teams in the NBA broke even or turned a profit. 

In 2015 the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, addressed the media saying [""a significant number of teams are losing money every year""](https://clutchpoints.com/adam-silver-nba-teams-are-losing-money/).

&gt;""I don't know the precise number and don't want to get into it, but a significant number of teams are continuing to lose money and they continue to lose money because their expenses exceed their revenue.""

**Forbes 2015**

&gt;The five most profitable NBA teams made an average $37 million over the last five seasons, and eight teams made over $15 million last year. 

That's the 5 *best* in the league. 

&gt;The league's most profitable team is the Chicago Bulls, who have a five-year average profit of $55 million.

However, last season, 2016, the NY Knicks...

&gt;""...turned an NBA-record operating profit of $141 million last season."" 

That's the NBA's *record*.

**Forbes 2016**

For comparison, as of 2016, the [Dallas Cowboys Revenue was $700 million](https://www.forbes.com/teams/dallas-cowboys/), and operating profit was $300 million. [The Pats showed a revenue of $523 million](https://www.forbes.com/teams/new-england-patriots/), and operating profit of $212 million. 

In 2017, the [average NBA franchise is worth $1.37 Billion](https://www.forbes.com/nba-valuations/#3e081e116db6), whereas the *lowest* franchise in the NFL in 2016 was the [Buffalo Bills at $1.5 Billion](http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2016/09/14/forbes-nfl-valuations-detroit-lions/90361894/). (NFL league average, 2.3 B per franchise, is a billion dollars higher than that of the NBA).

So, while the players may be bumming, the NFL owners sure as shit are not going to adopt the ways of NBA owners, and dig themselves into those types of financial holes. ",nfl

- Give a small percent slow on her e when it hits (since she has to briefly stop to throw it)

- Give a her a passive that isnt some crappy minigame passive where you collect dragons (i would still accept her old passive)

- Make it so the movement speed buff from her w does not diminish over time anymore

- Give her the 20% bonus damage to monsters back to compete with early pressure junglers

This being said i do not think she is in a super weak state and think she is still very playable in almost all elos.

Even for some stuff like golf, tennis, darts and snooker, I still get confused over the scoring even though it's so established. However, in sports, the capabilities and winning criteria is generally very clear cut. We generally have a sense of a person's stamina, running speed etc in a game. It's intuitive for any casual viewer just watching from the bartop counter.

But character abilities, ~~item abilities~~, map layout, clutch abilities (die^3, rez, or tranquility) will make people go, wait what why huh?

They say foreign applications for Cambridge are down 14% already, and that was 6 months ago. The situation is getting worse now as it's becoming clearer there will be no deal, it'll be a hard brexit.

2914,"Wow, since battle pets got added later in the game I never realized how confusing this must be to a new hunter!

I think most other posts here probably answer your question but to put it in a bit more depth. The battle pet page is a collections page for little vanity pets that don't help your character fight. It's not hunter exclusive, and they're the critters you see in the world. At first they just existed as a fun little familiar following you around and being cute, but eventually they decided to essentially add pokemon into the game by making it so those little vanity pets could level up and fight each other (but still be meaningless in normal combat). Now some critters have a green paw mark above their names (and they show up on the mini map), that indicates it's a pet you could fight with your vanity pets and possibly capture for your own. There's different rarities and each one can get up to level 25. You choose a team of up to 3 pets and each has 3 different abilities you can use in combat (each ability slot has two options at max level) and it's a turn based fight much like pokemon. The vanity pets are saved account wide on all characters, just like your mounts you will eventually get.

In contrast, the pets you tame as a hunter are your companions for questing and actual fighting on your character. They're mobs that actually pose a threat to you, normally (critters fall over dead if you so much as look at them). You can manage them with stable masters in cities where you can stash your pets and take out different ones. It's a pretty fun part of being a hunter, and eventually you can get rare pets that have special abilities (like there's one that can bring people back to life if they die in combat).",wow

At that point I was about 870 and I could get into NH normal and some heroics. Then just 2 more weeks another legendary, hit 900 and joined tomb groups. I've only done the first 4 bosses of tomb on heroic and I've cleared normal tomb twice. 

I just wasn't too picky about groups and on weekends there would be groups that said AP farm or ""viewer raid"" and I would just apply and usually they could get past the first few bosses and there would be people higher ilvl then me I would just ask if they needed drops. This past week I definitely got really lucky, I went from 905 to 914 because I picked up 6 pieces of loot between normal and heroic tomb.  

Highest M+ keys I have done are 8 and 9. But when I was 890 I was doing 2-4. Broken shore for war supply turn ins was the best method I found and do invasions and the goblin treasure quest chain. 

Oh and about joining groups don't just apply to groups that are already 2/4/8 or something. Everyone applies to them and chances are if you actually need the loot you aren't getting in. I would sign up for 0/2/5 groups and things like that and just do something else while they filled. Those groups tend to not have as many people applying to them and can't afford to be as picky about who they let in.",wow

Many people believe the fire is from Dany's dragons, but it could be that Dany's dragons are not there at all and it was some sort of guerrilla-like attack by Euron in the middle of the night. The fire might be from Euron's men using fire arrows or something with flammable liquid (Westerosi molotovs, made out rum maybe?) to burn down sails and immobilize part of the fleet?

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

No. Explosives play no part in any definition of terrorism, nor does politics **have** to play a part. Terrorism is simply using fear to achieve a means. These people weren't trying to scare anyone, they were simply trying to stop the boat from sailing.

Before you start telling me what the definitions of words are, and telling me I'm an apologist, it may pay to have a look for yourself if you can back your claims up. Might I add I never excused the acts, I'm simply defining them differently. Throwing the word ""terrorism"" out there every time someone does something bad only confuses the word.",europe

Genji feels like an actual Japanese character, and Hanzo feels like an American film buff's idea of what a Japanese person is like.  The large lack of Japanese in Hanzo's voice acting doesn't help.

They also hit into a lot of double plays, so they often get 2 hits and a walk in an inning and don't score a single run. Their average with runners in scoring position is also terrible. This is why they might get a lot of hits in a game but only score a few runs.

Other times, they simply can't get on base, like today where they had 3 hits for the whole game. They have a few guys who are regular starters that are batting in the low .200s. 

To compound the problem, this lack of runs takes its toll on the pitching, which is the team's only saving grace. It is way easier to pitch with a lead because you can go after the hitters by throwing strikes and getting ahead in the count. The starting pitchers know they have little room for error because if they give up more than 2 runs, it is most likely going to result in a loss for the Dodgers.

&gt; Fanservice done in classics like Gunbuster are a masterclass of animation and art

We still have fanservice being used in interesting  ways, you yourself mention the Monogatari series, which is a pretty good example (but  not the only one mind you). And please, let's not pretend that every show back then had artistically meaningful fanservice, Gunbuster is the exception not the rule. 


&gt; Fanservice has definitely gotten more contrived and the ecchi shows don't even have good plot to make up for it.

They never did. Making it sci-fi and having the characters be of an arbitrary age you find acceptable and can relate to doesn't make fanservice any more tastefull or any less stupid and contrived.
 
&gt; I feel like it is much more fair to compare classics to classics. Yes, there are lot of genre garbage but the way those shows are garbage has changed.

 Saying something doesn't make it true, and even if it is, in what way does garbage ""changing"" make it any better or worse? It's still garbage.

Back then we had shitty, poorly written shows set on spaceship, now we have shitty, poorly written shows set in highschool, what a downgrade.


&gt;  At any rate, what do we have in modern anime that compares to classics from previous decades?

More than that, looks like.

&gt;During the Invasion of France, German aircraft violated Swiss airspace at least 197 times.[15] In several air incidents, the Swiss shot down 11 Luftwaffe planes between May 10, 1940 and June 17, 1940.[15]

-

&gt;On June 20, 1940, the Swiss air force was ordered to stop intercepting planes violating Swiss airspace. Swiss fighters began instead to force intruding aircraft to land at Swiss airfields. Anti-aircraft units still operated. Later, Hitler and Hermann Göring sent saboteurs to destroy Swiss airfields. However, the saboteurs were captured by Swiss troops before they could cause any damage.

-

&gt;From 1943 Switzerland stopped American and British aircraft, mainly bombers, overflying Switzerland during World War II: six times by Swiss air force fighters and nine by flak cannons, and 36 airmen were killed.

-

&gt;Switzerland, surrounded by Axis-controlled territory, also suffered from Allied bombings during the war; most notably from the accidental bombing of Schaffhausen by American planes on April 1, 1944. It was mistaken for Ludwigshafen am Rhein, a German town 284 kilometres away. 40 people were killed and over 50 buildings destroyed, among them a group of small factories producing anti-aircraft shells, ball-bearings, and Bf-109 parts for Germany.[20][23][24][25]
&gt;
&gt;The bombing limited much of the leniency the Swiss had shown toward Allied airspace violations. Eventually, the problem became so bad that they declared a zero-tolerance policy for violation by either Axis or Allied aircraft and authorized attacks on American aircraft.",europe

Their security services did nothing to find my stolen device but has successfully locked me out of my own account for over 3 months. I can't access my apps and my phones security is not functioning.

The Boyat in UAE are women who are extreme tomboys with a penchant for military themed clothing. They often switch between roles of what is traditionally considered a woman and boyah by just taking off their abaya.

The Balkans have [Sworn Virgins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sworn_virgin), women who fill male gender roles and will not marry.

The [Muxe](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/weekinreview/07lacey.html) of Mexico are males who feel they identify more with being a female, and are okay in what is considered kind of an intolerant country for deviant sexualities.

In Sambia, there are different types of men- those who need semen from other males in order to become men, those who donate it to others so the male essence can be passed on, and those who no longer participate in the rituals.

The Navajo used ""nadleeh"" to refer to ""masculine feminine-bodied"" and ""feminine masculine-bodied"", which is can be as confusing as it sounds, related to two-spirited. In fact, most aboriginal cultures had more than two sexes and genders. Because there are so many split across the world, it's hard to pick out anything but the most notable (which includes the well-known [Two-Spirited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit))

An Anishnabe tale tells of how man lived apart from each other and alone, so the Creator made sex pleasurable to bring them together, that they would desire sex, it would make them feel good and increase the population.

In Ancient Greece, however, lines were muddied based on social status and power. While not traditionally different ""genders"", there were certainly enforced rules to treat them wildly differently. For example, an Aristocratic male could have sex with a boy, but not another man's wife.

The [hijra](http://www.pbase.com/maciekda/hijras) of south asia are men who dress and act like women, with feminine gender roles, but identify as neither. There's quite a large amount of them, really, they're even mentioned in the Kama Sutra.

Of course, there's the ladyboys in Thailand. There are some in the west who consider this to be strictly associated with prostitution for some reason.

[Bishonin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bish%C5%8Dnen) in Japan, basically just a boy who is extremely beautiful and crosses any gender designations because of it. Consider it the max level of beauty that a culture can designate.

Diminishing returns would be something like, if we imagine a hypothetical game system where you have the stat Strength and the stat Damage:

If you have =&lt; 10 strength, every point of Strength gives 1 Damage

But if you have more than 10, you only get 0.5 Damage for each point of Strength

See what I mean? Every point of Strength above 10 is objectively worse than the points before 10.

Neither Armor/MR or AD really have diminishing returns.

Here's another way of thinking about it:

Say you're taking a constant amount x of physical damage per second. This will allow you to survive for y seconds.

Every additional point of armour adds the *same* amount of seconds to your survival time.

It's true that if you can already survive for 10 minutes, then 1 extra second is not a lot in comparison, but this is not what it means to have diminishing returns.",leagueoflegends

That Argentina team is stacked and they can't even beat Chile in a final who's third best player is Medel/Bravo/Vargas who are all pretty average by big league standards. When they got to the WC finals Messi didn't score a single goal in the knockout stages. The only reason he got the Golden Ball is because both the award and Messi are sponsored by Adidas.

Ronaldo dragged Porto to the Euro final and practically coached them after he went down injured. On paper that team is barely top 7-8 in Europe (Spain, Germany, France are way better, Italy, England, Croatia, Holland arguably better)

Messi was amazing in La Liga but not in the CL this year. It was Neymar, not him, who dragged them all the way back against PSG and he didn't do much against juve either. And as a Chelsea fan I'll always remember the missed PK that would've knocked us out of the semis. 

I'm definitely more heavily weighting recent events since they're most telling of where a player is currently.

But that can be worked around, even deferred against title similar to property taxes. Either way, right now principle residences are exempt from capital gains tax which is a HUGE boon to property owners.

e.g. for the Battle Pet Challenge for [Deadmines](https://wow-petguide.com/index.php?m=DeadminesC), you get a list of strats and pet lineups, sometimes multiple options, and an easy copy/paste window to pre-fill the rematch pet lineups during the battle, and from rematch's team window, you can quickly paste and create the script for that new team. once you've filled in a few rematch and scripts, remember to  /reload in game to save the teams/scripts.",wow

3732,"It's still a work in progress, but basically I look at

-how frequently the champ was free relative to when the champ was released

-what are the intervals in which the champion gets free

So the first metric will prioritize champions that are released often, e.g. Ashe, Annie.

The second one will prioritize champions that are due to be released based on their schedule. So for example, Jax is usually free every 9th to 11th week. He was last free during week 44. So Jax is given a high modifier since he's due for another release soon.

I'm still tweaking the formulas though. For example, a weakness in the second formula is that as the pool of champions become bigger, we should expect the intervals for each champion to become longer as well, since they need to fit more champions into the rotation.

The night is shattered and she is not with me.

My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.

Her voide. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes. 

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. 
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

They also did, however, find her guilty of lesser charges, of providing false information to law enforcement officers. The jury did not ask to review any evidence.

&gt;
&gt;“It is a trip down a rabbit hole into a bizarre world where men who love their granddaughters find them drowned and do nothing,” Mr. Ashton said. “Where men who love their granddaughters take an accident, a completely innocent act, and make it look like a murder for no reason.”

**What is the fourth of July?**

Celebration of independence of the States from Britain. I think the date was used because two presidents shared a birthday? Thinking Lincoln and another?

**Who is Abraham Lincoln?**

Fourth(?) American president, president during the Civil War. Wrote and delivered the speech on the Lincoln memorial (was there in June) whose start I know but is currently escaping me.

**Something significantly different?**

Dunno what's being got at here; there's a huge amount of difference. The most obvious difference is the number of states that made it up.

**Supreme court ruling?**

No idea.

**Better president**

Franklin was never president.

**Denominations of American currency**

Coins - Cents, 5¢ and quarters (25¢). Also dollar coins do exist but are unpopular.

Notes - $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100

**Prohibition**

Period of time in the 1920/30s (?) where alcohol was illegal. This was when cocktails were invented to mask the godawful taste of the homemade spirits that people drank. I don't know why it ended (unenforceable?) but I guess it was a change in government.

**What is Vietnam?**

Country in South East Asia, Eastern most country of the peninsula which it shares with Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.

**Direction of the U.K. from America**

East-North-East.

**World War II**

The Hitler one, 1939 to 1945. The bombing of Pearl Habor by the Japanese in August? 1942 drew the U.S. into the war.

**Other Wars**

World War I, Vietnam War, First and Second Gulf Wars, Afghanistan (x2).

**Original colonies**

No idea. The founding fathers famously set off from Portsmouth and landed in Portsmouth.

**First President**

George Washington, there were presidents before him due some technicality that I can't remember.

**Watergate**

Hotel in Washington, D.C. where Nixon's aide was caught by the Washington Post(?) in some nefarious business of one kind or another. The whistle-blower was known as Deep Throat.

&gt; I watched the film Belladonna of Sadness today and it was interesting to compare to Rose of Versailles, especially as the RoV manga and Belladonna came out around the same time.   
  
Wooooo hyped to hear you saw it (and enjoyed it, according to MAL)!! Belladonna is probably one of the most extreme and strange films in the medium but as a part of the sort of greater feminist canon it's pretty indispensable, and really it's just fantastic on its own. An interesting detail I wasn't aware of until I checked out the interviews accompanying the restoration release, was that the film was originally intentioned to be pitched for young women and had many release tours with the idea of reaching that demographic, making it the first real Josei anime and showing some of the considerations that went on during that period in order to reach beyond the household market. I mentioned before how Ikeda developed the idea for RoV based on social revolutions going on at the time, so the two of them being released alongside one another and drawing from similar inspirations really does tell you how poignant these themes were for the time.  
  
A funny detail from Belladonna that makes the comparison even more interesting is who was involved with it: Osamu Dezaki himself worked on multiple animation cuts throughout the work as he was one of Tezuka's proteges at the time. The coincidence is really fun to consider, since he was working on this one feminist masterpiece while directing Ashita no Joe 1 at Mushi-Pro (Belladonna was in development for multiple years), and then working on *this* feminist masterpiece, RoV, while working on Ashita no Joe 2 about ten years later, both at studio TMS!!

First I quit my job, because memories attached to that job were part of the problem. That just made me more depressed:[ So I tried to get a new job which was hard: I ended up becoming a cab driver.

I abruptly moved to another city where I didn't know anyone. That made things a little bit better, but I would still have nightmares and sleep paralysis every night.

Then the Third War broke out, and he went to join the Alliance. He was not yet an adult and was too young to fight, but assisted his brethren in various ways - cooking, first aid, repairing armor, etc. One of the Wildhammer gryphon riders noticed him and sensed a potential within him. He talked to Volkh and told him that in Aerie Peak were dwarves that could teach him how speak with the elements and serve a greater purpose.

After the war, Volkh went to Aerie Peak with the Wildhammer to study and learn their shaman traditions. Ten years later, after Deathwing attacked Azeroth, he had completed his training as a Shaman and returned to assist the Ironforge and the Alliance, and Azeroth itself. He has continued in his craft as a jewelcrafter, mostly as a hobby, but has learned that he was using the elements to coax the gems from the rock naturally.

Most songs in that genre aren't pieces of art, crafted by a musician's personality and experiences and passion, but overpriced cups of coffee that you can't go three blocks without seeing repeated.  And unlike the coffee chain, when it comes to popular (the term i'll use to refer to those three genres for the remainder of this post) music, you don't even get to add a few little customizations to your steaming heap of bland, mass-produced vice.

Songs in those genres are written, re-written, edited, cut apart and pasted, and edited again by an team consisting of linguists and psychologists, sometimes, but not always, with a specific ""artist"" in mind, all of whom share the same goal: making the lyrical content appeal to as broad an audience as possible.  The more people you can hook with the song, the more profit you can generate through album sales, concert tickets, youtube views, etc.

I study about an hour a day, but my passive learning (because I play single player games exclusively in Japanese now) can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 6 hours a day.  Though my reading speed has improved because of the games, watching anime is still pretty hard, probably because I almost never practice using anime.  

So if you're similar to me, and start learning for an hour a day, and take a more game based route instead of listening to anime, you'll be able to figure out a good portion, but not all, of what's being said in anime. I'm currently 708 days in, but the first 3 and a half months I spent exclusively learning Kanji, which arguably put me back that much time and I'm not sure I'd recommend it. Just read like Tae Kim's grammar book to get a good basis and google the rest. Go try out the Core 10k deck on Anki, and hop on Hellotalk and start befriending natives. At least, that's what I did and do.

First, some history. At the time of Aegon's Invasion, the Iron Islands had a massive kingdom on mainland Westeros. King Harren the Black ruled over the Riverlands, as well as (I believe) parts of the Westerlands, the Reach, and the Stormlands. Of course Harren was burned alive by dragon fire in his great castle of Harrenhall, which the rest of Westeros thought was pretty great, because no one, and I mean no one, liked the Iron men and they were more than glad to see them leave. 

So then, for the next couple hundred years, the Iron Islands exist as this isolated mini-state off the coast of Westeros. No one ever really wants to be their ally, nor is anyone willing to let them declare independence. 

Now we get to the events of the show. (Not necessarily the books tho.)

Everyone on the Iron Islands understands that they stand to benefit from chaos on the mainland. Most go back to the old ironborn standard of reaving and raping up and down the coast like the old days. Some consider being able to carve out a mainland kingdom for themselves once again. But Euron is thinking about the bigger picture. 

Sure, they could raid the coasts, and everyone would keep on hating them. Sure, they could capture lands and subjugate the inhabitants, and everyone would keep on hating them. Sure, they could join an invading foreign army and gain a friend on the iron throne, but honestly, most people would still consider them undesirable invaders and keep on hating them.

Or, they could rebrand themselves as the kingdom that saved all of Westeros. They could smash the invading fleet, and be greeted in Kings Landing and Casterly Rock with cheers rather than screams. For the first time in centuries, the Ironborn could be considered friends to the Westerosi. They could start to make long standing alliances. They can start to marry into successful and influential houses. For the first time, since ever, the Ironborn could actually be welcome in Westerosi society and be seen as protectors and not threats.

Euron is trying, more than anyone else, to provide his people with a secure future. He is the only one thinking about the big picture. Everyone else would return the iron Islands to their old second class status. Euron sees that the Islands could have a future as an influential and prosperous nation, and feels that he has a duty as king to see that potential becomes a reality.",AskReddit

**Alice to Zouroku**

**Final Score: 7.4**

**MAL Score: 7/10**

My feelings about this show can be summed up as such:

**I like it when Sana is the subject, but I hate it when Sana is an object.**  To put things in simpler terms, the show is great when it focuses on Sana doing things, but its lower points come when things are happening to or around Sana.

The only character in this series who needs actual substantial growth as a human being is Sana.  Most of the cast are adults who either have their lives completely together (Zouroku) or are just deluded in their self-righteousness (Minnie C).  Those aren’t the people we should be focusing on.  Arguably along the same vein, neither should we be focusing on Sanae or the other kids who have Dreams of Alice.  They also are able to teach Sana many things about life and the outside world.

So making Sana the main heroine is the most logical conclusion because she needs the most development, making her a good candidate to experience the “Hero’s Journey” trope or whatever you want to call it.  But it baffles me so when they decided to make her the loli in distress during the first arc.  Sana is the “object” that is being fought over, and it completely undermines her development as a person.

You could argue that it’s Zouroku who is getting the development, but as I said earlier, he doesn’t need it.  He just blinks into existence in the car during Episode 4(?), and gives a speech to Minnie C about how he’s not taking any of her crap.  While his speech was indeed this highlight of that episode, he already entered with these convictions in mind, so we can’t really call that development.  At best, it shows how much Sana means to Zouroku.  

In fact, it is only such a highlight because it is more of a development of Sana than anything else.  It is a change in perspective on how Sana sees herself: as a human person who is loved rather than a tool.

The first half (with the exception of Episode 2, but especially Episode 5) was indeed the weaker of the two in the series because it treated Sana as an object rather than a subject.  The second half reverses this.  When Sana became the subject of the story, the series got a lot better.

Yes, the second half is a lot of slice of life elements.  Episode 5 was by far the most hype because of the fighting, but it was also by far the least meaningful.  The second half of this series, while a lot less action, is also the most impactful.

It works because it is about Sana learning about a lot of things and (I’ll really drive this point home again) developing as a person.  Episode 6 is where Sana learns about the concept of family and gets officially adopted by Zouroku.  Episode 7 is where she learns about what friends are, this concept that she had a vague idea of in her mind but could never quite put it to words.

Even the drama with Hatori and Ayumi all helped morally develop Sana.  Sana learned empathy and more about the gray area between right and wrong.  Sana got herself into most of her troubles, but she mostly got out by her own hand.  That is brilliant from a development standpoint.  And Hatori was the perfect foil for Sana to help process these feelings.

I think if this show knew what it wanted to be, this would easily be a top 5 of the season (minus sequels).  It has strong slice of life moments that actually didn’t feel meaningless like most in that genre.  But it also had these weird serious moments where A) we’ve seen them before done better, and B) contributed nothing to the development of Sana (or anyone for that matter).  Geez, Episode 5 wasted so much of my time that it just pisses me off.

-----

**Eromanga-sensei**

**Final Score: 7.1**

**MAL Score: 7/10**

Here’s a weird thought, in terms of accomplishing its goals, Eromanga-sensei was actually the 3rd best anime of the season (of what I’ve seen) behind Tsuki ga Kirei and SukaSuka.

Think about it: what was Eromanga-sensei trying to sell?  An otaku-bait show featuring a loli harem with the intent of getting them into risqué positions.  Can we check off all of those boxes?  With a huge, giant check.

But on a serious note, this show was just a gigantic mess.  It’s impossible to take this show seriously.

Some characters were just absolutely inconsequential to the overall plot.  “Megumin” and bookstore girl should have been more present for essentially being the Ayase and the Manami of the show.  The third place guy did absolutely nothing but make quips and jabs for how many times he appeared.

We got two Kuronekos this time in Elf and Muramasa.  That’s fine.  I liked Kuroneko.  BUT, I don’t think two people should occupy her role as the “otaku companion”, even if her personality is split among the two of them to make the seem different.  Episode 11 was Muramasa confessing to Masamune in more or less the same manner as Elf did in Episode 10.  Could’ve just saved us the grief by having both of them be the same character and only devoting one episode to that confession.  Then develop more of the main plot elsewhere.

For a show called “Eromanga-sensei”, we actually didn’t get very much Eromanga-sensei.  I felt like a lot of the show was Masamune hanging out with Elf and Muramasa, and then the rest was Sagiri getting mad at him for doing so.  There were very few moments that made Sagiri stand out as a character, and some episodes she’s just missing entirely.  Fine, gimme the harem, but focus on the main girl at least, unless they’re playing the long con and Elf or Muramasa is the one he gets with (which I’m totally okay with).

I will say that the Sagiri moments were some of the few moments of the series that felt well done and developed.  Sagiri slowly coming out of her shell was a nice development that I wish could have been more of the focus of this show.  But no, we get an episode devoted to ochinchin instead.

I don’t know what to say about the ending except that was the lamest, passive, lazy ending that I’ve ever seen, which almost certainly guarantees this a season 2.

-----

**Fukumenkei Noise**

**Final Score: 8.5**

**MAL Score: 8/10**

Let’s get one thing straight before I start here.  For the amount of praise I gave this show for its amazing use of symbolism and deep dialogue, I was never actually really invested in the romance itself.

Part of this may be because it was running in the same season as SukaSuka and Tsuki ga Kirei, two absolutely stellar romance series that will probably become comparisons for how I judge romance anime for a while.  It also ran alongside Renai Boukun and Eromanga-sensei, two anime that need to go die in a fire.  Fukumenkei Noise fell somewhere in the middle for me.

It may also have something to do with the fact that this show is a shoujo, therefore I am not its target audience by default.  But the irony of this statement is that Kimi ni Todoke is somewhere in my Top 5 anime of all time at the moment, so I dunno.  Fukumenkei Noise is probably only the second shoujo romance I’ve ever watched, so I’m pretty new to the entire genre.

So sure, maybe I wasn’t invested, but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t like it.  And I think this part was largely helped by the symbolism and the deep dialogue.  I cam empathize better with the characters when I know their thought processes, and this series did a pretty good job conveying each character’s wants and needs (even though they couldn’t do the same towards each other).  As a musician myself, I could definitely relate to the emotions they felt when playing and writing music.

I’ve talked at length before about the beauty that is the symbolism of the scenarios.  Each word spoken was said for a reason, and it reflected the innermost desires of each character.  Every scene served a purpose, and it framed a bigger story running in the background than what was happening in that moment.  I could write an in-depth analysis for each episode; the symbolism and dialogue should be noted and praised.  And maybe I will sometime in the future.

For now, it did a pretty good job.",anime

If I woke up a different race and gender (because let's take it this far) I would literally just be a new person. Every single person in this world would treat me differently. I mean, there are some core aspects and values that I have that are important to me, but so much would change because I wouldn't be the me I was before. Your body is a part of you, a _very_ big part of you, and that's why when our bodies change, we perceive ourselves, and the world, differently, and vice-versa. If you went from attractive- to unattractive, from able-bodied, to paraplegic, _you_ would change.

You know those movies where people switch bodies, or they wake up one day in a new body and when they return, they all of a sudden have this new perspective? That's their core being changing. Their mind opening up because they've walked in someone else's shoes.

People are very misguided. Your body is your temple. And I think there is way too much propaganda trying to convince people that they should not feel connected to their bodies.

""Feeling like a boy"" or ""feeling like a girl"" is stupid because being a boy or girl is different for every male and female (sex).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/48f47f473681db05f04331d9d62f9d46.png)  

&gt; Ennio Morricone born 10 November 1928 in Rome  is an Italian composer especially noted for his film scores. He has composed the scores of more than 500 motion pictures and television series, in a career lasting over 50 years. His scores have been included in over 30 award-winning films as well as several symphonic and choral pieces. Morricone is most famous for his work in the spaghetti westerns directed by his friend Sergio Leone. Morricone's sparse style of composition for the genre is particularly exemplified by the soundtracks of the classic spaghetti westerns The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, 1968).

&gt; Born in Rome, Morricone took up the trumpet as a child and attended the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to take lessons on the instrument at the age of nine. He formally entered a conservatory at the age of 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony programme. He received his trumpet diploma in 1946 and started working professionally, composing the music to ""Il Mattino"" (""The Morning""). Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film.
In the 1950s he received the ""Diploma in Instrumentation for Band"" (fanfare) where he won a diploma in Composition under the composer Goffredo Petrassi. In 1955, Morricone started to ghost write and arrange music for other, already established film composers. Morricone soon came to the attention of his former school friend Sergio Leone, who hired Morricone to compose the music to some of his best known films. Together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, A Fistful of Dollars.

&gt; He received his first Nastro d'Argento in 1970 for the music in Metti, una Sera a Cena (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, 1969) and his second only a year later for Sacco and Vanzetti (Guiliano Montaldo, 1971). He received his first nomination for an Academy Award in 1979 for the score to Days of Heaven (Terrence Malick, 1978) and another in 1986 for The Mission, 1987 for The Untouchables (Brian De Palma, 1987), 1991 for Bugsy (Barry Levinson, 1991) and 2001 for Malèna (Giuseppe Tornatore, 2000).

&gt; In 2003 he scored the Japanese Taiga drama about Miyamoto Musashi, Japan's legendary warrior. In 2005 he was on a world tour with the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, touring from cities like New York, Bilbao, Bratislava and Tokyo. In 2006, Morricone collaborated with Morrissey by composing the string part for his song ""Dear God Please Help Me"", recorded in Rome's Forum Music Village Studios. In recognition of his vast body of work and dedication, Morricone received an honorary Academy Award in 2007; Morricone had received nominations for Best Original Score in the past, but had failed to win.

He was always my Hero. And so I always tried to be just like him -- as a husband and then as a father. But I thought him perfect, basically, and so I always felt myself lacking, deficient, a failure. Always just a small chip off the 'ol block and never anything more.

&gt;The devalued currency is actually hurting the ability of Germans to create jobs and reduces Germans purchasing power


Although this is sad to hear, it does support my original point that the US is economy is in the lead, although that might no always be the case.

&gt;Germany has a small export surplus

See above


&gt;Americans can't afford a 500 dollar emergency

The article talks about how this is cultural and not really an economic issue. Us Americans are absolutely garbage at saving money. I personally can't afford a 500 dollar emergency, but that's all the fault of my own spending habits and not because of wages or anything like that because the minimum wage here is pretty good. The article mentions that the only 37% of Americans would actually keep random 1,000$ on the street in savings.

&gt;Lot of your wealth is owned by foreign debt

Actually, about half of our debt (en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States) is owned by the citizens of the US. I don't know how that compares to the other nations on the list, but that makes the US situation less dire. The EU, Eurozone, and the UK also all rank pretty highly as well on percent of GDP as debt, with each being around 80-90% of debt as GDP compared to the US' 107%

China, the country that will replace the US eventually as the strongest economy, has a much higher percentage than originally let on, as most of their debt is actually from local governments. 


""By 2015, local government entities owed a total of about 18 trillion yuan (about one-third of China's economy)"" - en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_China#Local_and_provincial_debt

I don't know how much of that debt of theirs is from their own citizens, but they definitely are on a rocky boat as well.

In the NBA, players don't bother playing defense. Whats the equivalent here? Torii Hunter still will [make this catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcQ5De9ZcZc). Chris Sale is still going to throw his sliders. Nolan Arenado is still going to throw bullets from third. It's not like you're going to have Clayton Kershaw start throwing batting practice, there's still a competitive game. 

Because if you truly wanted the game to ""Mean Something"" and win, then you would want Kershaw to pitch as much as possible. You wouldn't pull any of your starting position players.

This means providing recipts of marriage expenses, marriage gifts, photos of weddings/relatives, honeymooning, travel, printouts of private IM conversations with your spouse and logs of phone calls. It's not a foolproof process but to someone going through it legitimately, it felt horribly invasive and degrading (imagine sharing your private conversations with your spouse). 

The point here is that just like there are no pro-immigrarion at any cost people, there shouldn't be anti-immigration at any cost folks. The middle ground is the rigour around the process and if you feel it's not rigorous enough, we can and should have a conversation around it. ",canada

If your company has respect for you, they don't manipulate, they talk to you directly, and there isn't any political struggle. They come to you directly with coherent needs and they expect you to follow them and why wouldn't you? You have respect for them. If you have ideas they are receptive because hey: we are all on the same company boat! When they lie to you, mislead you, dangle promotions, etc. It is another way of stating: we don't respect you. We expect you to give yourself to us. If you don't like it: leave (this is when talent leaves, and all your bottom feeders begin their ascent to the top. Your company is dead now, but it'll be years before a real time of death is called. Your company is a zombie now.)

It all comes back to critical thinking skills. Workplaces lack it, and so they rely on political manuevering to get things done (it's the absence of skills the necessitates this).

But when I listen to dubs myself, it kind of just feels *wrong*; The accents simply stand out way too much.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9669e2a8dab24b0a8e59687a50802d41.png)  

&gt; Medeski Martin &amp; Wood and John Scofield have collaborated on two albums to date, Scofield's A Go Go and the more recent Out Louder. You can find them with several names, here at Last.fm: Medeski Scofield Martin and Wood and Billy Martin, Chris Wood, John Medeski &amp; John Scofield are some variations possible.
The band received some of their first significant exposure outside of the New York City jazz scene by performing with Phish at their October 14, 1995 concert, which led to the association of the group as a jam band.
In addition, their performance on John Scofield's 1997 album A Go Go helped to further their exposure. The band collaborated further with Scofield again in 2006, releasing the album Out Louder under the name Medeski Scofield Martin &amp; Wood. This was the first album released on MMW's own Indirecto Records.
Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's first performances together were at the Village Gate, a popular New York jazz club. They were initially an acoustic jazz trio, but Medeski added a Hammond organ when the difficulties of touring with a piano became apparent. 
Their first album, Notes from the Underground, is a record of their entirely-acoustic era. All of their subsequent albums reveal Medeski's use of a wide variety of keyboards, including mellotron, melodica, and a clavinet. Wood entirely eschewed the electric bass for MMW's first three albums, and still relies heavily on the acoustic upright bass in recordings and during live performances. Their earlier albums reveal a Hip Hop influenced updating of classic soul jazz sounds, which is the primary theme of their well-known 1996 album, Shack-man.
From 1998 to 2005, MMW were signed to leading jazz label Blue Note Records, and showed them delving deeper into dense, electronic funk than their earlier albums, although the band continued to experiment with free jazz and free improvisation both on their albums and in concert. In 2001 MMW performed several songs for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot + Indigo, a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.
Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's live performances are renowned for their exploratory nature. Their concerts usually involve extended improvisations, which may be both arrhythmic and atonal, an aspect of their musicianship that is rarely documented in the studio. They occasionally tour using only acoustic instruments, reverting to the instrumentation that they began their career with. Their album Tonic is an example of these more contemporary acoustic performances. They have also done short tours of entirely improvisatory performances. These shows usually consisted of two sets of improvisation, followed by an encore of a song from an album. Read more on Last.fm.

4690,"&gt; From both novels and wc3 games prior to Legion, we know that Illidan does ultimately have the best intentions for Azeroth.

I'm not sure where you were seeing this. RoC it was because Tyrande asked him to, as well as the prospect of gaining more power. TFT was because KJ coerced him into destroying LK, or face destruction himself. The novels have shown how power hungry Illidan was, as well as his own magic addiction. Let's not forget how half the time he was trying to impress Tyrande.         
        
&gt; his ultimate goal was to save Azeroth.

4769,"&gt;but comparing today's players to his points seems unfair.

I'm not aware of many (honest) people doing this. Cross-era comparisons are notoriously difficult; the prevailing thought seems to be comparing dominance over peers. So in that sense, it looks even more cherry for Gretzky, who obliterated every other top scorer/HoFer in his era, with only Lemieux coming anywhere close.

My view is that too many people ascribe scoring levels of the mid/late 70s-early 90s to all the pre-90s years and that just isn't accurate. Those years were complete anomalies in the history of league scoring, and though Orr, Esposito, the Bruins, Gretzky, the Oilers, the Islanders, and the Lemieux-era Pens helped raise gpg rates, WHA contraction/NHL expansion, European player migration, shifts in game strategy/equipment/training, and minor league systems all forced significant changes to scoring levels.

I'm no hockey historian, or knower of arithmetic, but a pet peeve is the simplified argument that typically accompanies any reflection on the league pre-1995. Wayne Gretzky played in the same league as Mario Lemieux, and Mario Lemiuex, who played in the same league as Steve Yzerman, who played in the same league as Peter Stastny, were all doing their best to score as many points as they could. Would we ever conclude that Stastny puts up 155 on a terrible Wings team and wins the Pearson over Lemieux? Would we ever conclude that if Yzerman had Oilers-era Coffey that he'd put up 199 points on a terrible Pens team? Is there anything to suggest that Lemieux would score 200 points (I gladly accept a 1 point swing!) more than once...nevermind 4 times?

From 81-82 to 86-87, Gretzky *averaged* **203 points**. As Bill O'Reilly might well say: ""*You can't explain that.*""

Anyway, all that to say, league scoring levels are driven by a multitude of factors, and yet, somehow, we always circle back to things being easier for certain players, despite said players spanning and dominating in multiple eras. So yes, I agree, that point comparisons are flawed. But at a certain point, when a guy *averages* **203 points** over 6 seasons, I think we're clear to draw a line. And that line is right there, at that 200 god damn points mark.

Nor can it be fairly compared to any vape... But compared to my Iolite it is very even. It's small, handy, good quality (thought it looked low-grade on pictures) and decently priced. However it is still a pipe and vape does taste better than pipe.

The police will always arrest someone who has apparently shot an intruder, or used a firearm to defend their property. The investigation follows and depending on the circumstances the crown prosecutes or drops charges. Think about it from a law enforcement perspective, can you let someone go free who has allegedly shot another person without an investigation?  

People have had charges dropped, and sometimes the charges are lessened. Depending on the firearm used, and it's legal status might result in unsafe storage charges or something similar. You can't legally have a loaded pistol in your side table, or conceivably use a restricted firearm based on storage laws. (Get a short non restricted shotgun for home defense) . And if the gun is illegally owned you're in big trouble regardless. 

You'll be prosicuted if warning shots are used, like a guy in my neighborhood who shot out at the dark and left holes in people's houses to scare off an attacker. I don't care about defending your house, you can't accedently shoot someone in bed. 

The most important thing that needs to be revealed in an investigation is if the use of force was appropriate. If you're safety isn't being threatened you can't shoot. It has to be a reasonable response, and being a criminal trial it will require that you're found guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

Detainee, though only 16 years old at the time of his travel to Afghanistan, has been found to be intelligent and educated and understands the gravity of his actions and affiliations. Detainee excelled at his training in Afghanistan, which included small arms, explosives training, IEDs, mines, mine laying, and configuring IEDs for remote detonation using hand held devices. Detainee admits to having participated in several mining operations and harassing attacks against US Forces, in addition to throwing the grenade that killed a US solider. Detainee has never expressed any genuine remorse for the killing of that soldier. He has direct family affiliations with senior Al-Qaida members, has received advanced specialized training in explosives, and has directly participated in hostile attacks against US Forces. Detainee claims that his entire family lived at one of Usama Bin Laden's compounds in Jalalabad, AF. Detainee continues to provide valuable information on his father's associates, and on non-governmental organizations that he worked with in supporting Al-Qaida, as well as other major facilitators of interest to the US. Detainee has also provided valuable information on the Derunta, Al-Farouq and Khalden training camps, indicating that the detainee has been to and likely trained at these locations; and he continues to provide valuable information on key Al-Qaida and Taliban members.

2. I would consider weed to be safer than alcohol. Alcohol is the cause of many crimes/diseases, and it honestly amazes me that alcohol is legal. If alcohol were to be invented tomorrow, it would be illegal, and that is a fact. However, abuse of any drug (Alcohol, cannabis or any other) is dangerous. Weed is great for unwinding at the end of a stressful day, or hanging out with friends, but it's not good to become dependent on weed at all. Weed should enhance a good life, not be the focus of it. 

3. I started smoking in the final year of University, when I was 22. I'm 24 now. Don't smoke just because everyone else is doing it, or if it's 'cool'. Try it once.

This is always really nice to see on reddit, and I honestly, genuinely appreciate this.

So, Let's talk about this more.

Yeah, the group of people that forced the woman out of her position are absolutely wrong. I absolutely condemn that, and think it's an issue.

I don't think it's an issue with Islam specifically, or at least, Islam is no more of an issue to Muslims than Christianity is an issue to Christians in cases like this.

It hasn't been that long since [christians were doing the same kinds of things in canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lgbtq-canada-class-action-1.4047232), but look at the progress we've made in such a short amount of time.

I don't think a gay wedding with an entire supportive muslim family could ever happen in the middle east. This is the effect of canadian culture. It's hard for first generation immigrants, and refugees to instantly assimilate, but there's no reason to believe that these kids growing up in Canadian schools with Canadian friends and holding Canadian values are going to hold on to these oppressive views.

Like, Imagine if we had a family move in from Saudi arabia, and the dad really didn't want his daughters to drive ever. How long do you think that would last? When that girl saw all of her friends driving, tons of women driving, and no issues, do you think she's going to hold on to that specific weird interpretation of her religion when she grows up? It seems crazy to me to even imagine she would.

And yes, I understand that integration is hard. And that stuff like this is going to happen when we have a large influx people from countries like the ones in the middle east, but [we are helping](http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-yazidi-family-plea-son-freed-isis-1.4212327).

joffery: she takes his side during the incident were the butchers kid gets killed and her wolf has to be put down, it is pretty clear at that point that joffery wasn't very nice. however she keeps looking forward to being married to him even after they get to kings landing. 


convincing ned:in the books she asks ned to confess and take the black and works on cersei's behalf to get ned to publicly admit that joffery is the legitimate heir. i think she visits him in while he is imprisoned too. I guess i got the book and show mixed up. sansa thinks she is saving her dad, but she still is a cog in the machine that gets ned killed.


manipulated/victim/boltons:I think sansa has spent most of the show as a victim, either trapped in kings landing or trapped with the boltons and having a bunch of bad stuff happen to her over and over. There isn't a lot of forward momentum in her storyline until very recently and it gets boring watching nothing the same thing happen over and over again to a character, especially when the same thing is unpleasant. it doesn't have to do with what the character could do differently, it has more to do with the storyline that the writers put her in. a lot of fans had the same problem with daenarys doing the same thing over and over in slavers bay and the storyline feeling slow. its more frustrating when the character, who is one of the good guys, just keeps losing over and over again and is never able to do anything, especially when the she got out of kings landing but then agreed to go back into a similar situation.


yeah those are fair criticisms of jon, and i think fans have talked about that - especially him not listening to Sansa about ramseys psychological warfare.  but that doesn't change salsa's actions and she has done more annoying things with bigger consequences and her storyline has not been as satisfying so far.



I am not saying anything should be changed in the story, i think Sansa is a good character, just most of the time the character is making mistakes and the reader/watcher wants the good guys to win. Just like everyone hated joffery, but also thought the character was well written. Sansa is naive and idealistic and keeps losing and getting hurt because of that. 

The only thing that doesn't really make sense to me is that she would go marry ramsey. that is different from the book so it could be explained by the show runners trying to hit a plot point from the book without adding another character that would just confuse things and take up more time. a related complaint people have about her arc is that she goes through hell at kings landing, gets out and the character appears to be moving forward, and then she seems to backtrack to a vulnerable position again. her arc in the book will probably be different and more satisfying because she doesn't marry ramsey in the book. I understand that the show runners can't put everything from the books in the show but i think they could have found a better way to cover the bolton plot line without undermining salsa's character arc.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/67326a16577a4e98ce732412f47073b0.png)  

&gt; The Beach Boys are an iconic American rock band, frequently cited as one of the most influential and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music due to their intricate vocal harmonies, studio experiments, and novel approaches to pop songwriting. Rooted in doo-wop and rock and roll, their early string of vocal surf hits defined the '60s California Sound. For a period afterward, they notably delved into progressive pop styles. often combining elements from classical and jazz in innovative ways. 

&gt; Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer and bandleader Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry.

&gt; On their first few studio albums, the group primarily played surf music, but this changed after 1964 as their songs became more sophisticated and autobiographical. The 1965 album Today! particularly represented this shift in sound. Bruce Johnston joined the group that same year. Session drummer Hal Blaine is quoted: ""We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing.""

&gt; Following their most esteemed work, Pet Sounds (1966), the band became symbols of psychedelic counterculture. The highly anticipated follow-up, Smile, was left unfinished, and Brian soon relinquished his creative hold on the group. A trilogy of lo-fi releases followed: Smiley Smile (1967), Wild Honey (1967), and Friends (1968). Brian would not be credited as a primary composer for any Beach Boys album until 1977's Love You, an album on the fringe of synth-pop, new wave, and punk.

&gt; In Brian's absence, the Beach Boys still managed to release music that was regarded favorably by fans and critics despite poor sales: Sunflower (1970) and  Surf's Up (1971). South African musicians Blondie Chaplin  and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on the next two albums: Carl &amp; the Passions - So Tough (1972), and Holland (1973).

&gt; Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness and drug addiction; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.

The swastika (as a character 卐 or 卍) is an ancient religious symbol used in the Indian subcontinent, East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is also a historic symbol found in almost every culture with different significance. It is known outside Asia as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion. A swastika generally takes the form of a symmetrically arranged equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees.

**Environment**  
We enjoy weekly guild activities such as speed runs of farm content (Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, and The Nighthold) where we gear our new players and alt characters and Mythic+ pushes to ensure that everyone has a chance to get a +15 run for the week. Our members are very active and social in game and we have a Discord channel to communicate out of game. If you are looking for a calm, peaceful place to focus on progression while enjoying the company of your fellow guild members, this is the place for you!  
  
**Recruiting**  
We are currently openly recruiting the listed classes and specializations for our Core Raider team. In addition, we are always openly recruiting all classes and specializations for our casual raiding team as well as social players who would like to be a part of our friendly community.  
  
* Death Knight (DPS Spec) - High  
* Mage (Any Spec) - High  
* Paladin (Retribution) - Medium  
* Rogue (Any Spec) - High  
* Shaman (Elemental) - High  
  
**Raiding**  
Battle Scars was formed half-way into The Nighthold raid tier. After developing our raid team, we ended Nighthold with 4/10 Mythic kills and look forward to progressing even further in Tomb of Sargeras where we have been able to advance into a new tier together as a team. Our current progression in Tomb of Sargeras is 7/9 Heroic.  
  
For continuing Tomb of Sargeras progression and looking forward towards the Antorus raid, we will be raiding three days per week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm server time). We also have raids for the Normal level of the current tier on Wednesday that are mandatory at the beginning of the tier and change to optional after the first month.  
  
While we pride ourselves on our friendly community and non-toxic raiding environment, we do expect all members of our raiding team to come fully prepared and focused to our raids. We are able to create this unique environment by respecting our fellow raid members and the time, effort, and dedication that every other member of our team is putting in each day. As such, we prefer players who are excited about raiding and look forward to learning and working to progress through new content.

Oh yeah, they just made one of the biggest successes of the genre, which continues to rise in size and popularity. Totally just effective ""on paper"" rather than in reality.

&gt; The current problem in Overwatch is the lack of team play and the impact of even one person not contributing is too high.

Like I said, they've tested this stuff already. 6 is the magic number of personal responsibility and team play, and the wild, continued popularity of the game supports that.

&gt;But the reality is the team play isn't emphasized enough especially in QP and comp.

Here's the problem with your reasoning: *it's the same for the enemy team.* The only difference between your team and the enemy team is *you.* 
This balances the game out due to a certain law I'll mention later.

&gt;The atmosphere I see here with the ""any player can go up in rank if they're good""

Because it's true. You don't need to ""carry"" either for it. When you're good at your role, you drag up the efficiency of your team by some degree or another, which will cause you to rise in the ranks due to *the law of big numbers.*",Overwatch

When he heard of Dany in Mereen, he sent his elder son to court her and marry her - though she went missing soon after he got there. This was the guy who thought that maybe he could control the chained dragons and tried to smuggle them out - only to set them free and get roasted for his efforts. 

Instead of trying to kill Myrcella, Doran's daughter and the Sand Snakes tried to crown her Queen as a move against Cersei. Doran decisively put a stop to that and confided his real plans in his daughter.

&gt; The Doklam dispute is the latest in a long-running series of territorial flare-ups between India and China.

&gt; The dispute began on June 16, when China accused Indian border guards in the northeastern state of Sikkim of crossing into its territory in southwestern Tibet, in an attempt to obstruct the construction of a new mountain road. India has not denied its troops were present in the area.

&gt; &amp;quot;The situation does indicate that China is willing to test the limits of what it can get away with in all regions, not just the South and East China Seas-which shows both confidence and its desire to probe for possible geopolitical weak points,&amp;quot; said Yvonne Chiu.

5135,"Listen what I have to tell you, before wod came out players  were able to obtain the title ""of the black harvest"", now that title is not obtainable anymore, the quest was pretty difficult, considering I also had pretty shitty gear, but I did it, it was the most satisfying Moment I had in wow, I had spent a whole night trying to kill that boss but I did it. Now you maybe wondering, what does have that to do with your problem? Well, when wod eventually came out, I was not given the title, nor the achievement, what I did was send a ticket to blizz, they replied they   couldn't do nothing about it, I had also submitted screenshots, but nothing, they would say that I had not completed the quest and couldn't obtain the title (which was bullshit because I did)  so I kept sending tickets demanding to be given what I had worked so hard to get, and by expressing my disappointment for how that situation was developing. After 1 or 2 weeks, can't remember, I logged into warlock to find that I was given the achievement and the title. 
My advice to you is to keep sending tickets (no spamming ofc), demand to talk with another GM someone superior I mean,the situation you got into is not only unfair but also ridiculous, but remember not to lose your cool, always be polite.

Frankly, the downsides are no big fucking deal, especially compared to almost any other popular substance. People like to dump their problems on substances and associate certain behaviors, but that's usually a correlation made by the person. Also, crazy fucking idea, maybe how it affects one person doesn't apply for everyone else?

99% of reddit anti-weed stuff is all bro-science and popular opinion (e.g. ""I stopped smoking and X happened.""). Well what about the sober person lighting up that stopped lighting up? Could it be something else that changed in the person that *coincedently* changed how they thought about getting high?

&gt; Boards of Canada are an electronic music duo from Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, formed in 1985 and comprised of brothers Mike Sandison (born 1 June 1970) and Marcus Eoin (born 21 July 1971). They have released a number of works, most notably the studio albums Music Has the Right to Children (1998), Geogaddi (2002), and The Campfire Headphase (2005) on the pioneering electronic music label Warp. Their fourth album Tomorrow's Harvest was released in June 2013.

&gt; Boards of Canada have had an enormous influence on the ambient, downtempo and IDM scenes. They have frequently made reference to the warm, scratchy, artificial sounds of 1970s television. Indeed, the Sandison brothers admit to being inspired by the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada, from which they take their name. The duo have recorded a few minor works under the name Hell Interface. Boards of Canada’s music has been used in several CSI episodes and on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim interlude shorts; small bits of their music have been used on the BBC program Top Gear for transitional music.

&gt; Early Boards of Canada (1970s-1995)

&gt; Growing up in a musical family, brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands, however, it wasn't until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike’s band that Boards of Canada was born.

&gt; By 1989, the band had been reduced to Sandison, Eoin and Christopher Horne. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small, fairly regular shows among the “Hexagon Sun” collective.

&gt; In early 2000, the official website for the band, Music70.com (now boardsofcanada.com) removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include ""Play by Numbers"", ""Acid Memories"", ""Hooper Bay"", and the earliest known release by the band is titled ""Catalog 3"". None of the material from those days is readily available, and since official Boards of Canada sources ignore the existence of this material, there seems to be little chance for this early material to ever resurface.

&gt; Boards of Canada from Twoism (1995-present)

&gt; In 1995, the band released the first work from the Hexagon Sun studio, the EP ""Twoism"". Like earlier Music70 releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases though, a small number of copies were also released to the public through the IDM mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of such high quality to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002 and serves as a demarcation point into more professional releases.

&gt; The precursor to ""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1996. Titled ""Boc Maxima"", it was a semi-private release that is notable for being a full-length album. Boc Maxima’s work was later used for ""Music Has the Right to Children"", with which it shares many tracks.

&gt; Boards of Canada’s first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of Autechre’s Sean Booth of the English label Skam Records, one of many people sent a demo EP. Skam released what was considered Boards of Canada’s first ""findable"" work, ""Hi Scores"", in 1996.

&gt; ""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1998. Many fans consider this record to be a masterpiece. The popularity of the record was substantial enough to start a wave of sound-alikes.

&gt; John Peel featured Boards of Canada on his BBC Radio 1 program in January of 1998. The session featured two remixes from ""Music Has the Right to Children"" — ""PlayAquarius (Version 3)"" and ""PlayOlson (Version 3)"" — along with the tracks ""Happy Cycling"" and “XYZ”. Excluding “XYZ”, the set was released on a Warp Records CD titled ""Peel Session TX 21/07/1998"".

&gt; Though never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp label-mates Seefeel and Autechre in a scattering of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills, including two Warp parties: Warp’s 10th Anniversary Party in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the Tortoise-curated All Tomorrow’s Parties festival. They have not performed a live show since.

&gt; Boards of Canada released a four-track EP, ""In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country"", in November 2000, their first original release in two years.

&gt; The full-length album ""Geogaddi"" was released in 2002. It was described by Sandison as ”a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.”

&gt; Throughout most of their career, Mike and Marcus chose not to publicize their brotherhood and were simply portrayed as childhood friends. Their kinship was finally revealed in a 2005 Pitchfork interview. Mike explained that they concealed the fact to avoid comparisons to Orbital, another well-known UK electronic group composed of two brothers.

&gt; Their third album for Warp Records, ""The Campfire Headphase"", was released on 17 October 2005. The album covers much of the same musical territory as their previous works and featured fifteen tracks, including “Peacock Tail”, “Chromakey Dreamcoat”, and “Dayvan Cowboy”. Two versions of “Dayvan Cowboy” — the original and a remix by Odd Nosdam — are on the six-track EP, ""Trans Canada Highway"", which was released on 26 May 2006.

&gt; Sound and methods

&gt; Brief songs or “vignettes” feature prominently in their music. Such songs are often weaving melodies or speech accompanied by atmospherics to capture a specific moment or mood. They often last less than two minutes, but, as Sandison says, “those short tracks you mention, we write far more of those than the so-called ‘full on’ tracks, and in a way, they are our own favorites”.

&gt; Boards of Canada have written an enormous number of song fragments and songs, most of which will never be released. It does not appear that music is made exclusively for commercial release. Rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work, which is a compositional technique shared by many electronic or experimental artists such as Nightmares on Wax, Canabrism and King Crimson. Geogaddi’s development involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 23 were selected, one of which is silence.

&gt; Subliminal messages, symbolism, and religion

&gt; Marcus and Mike have both expressed a strong interest in the power of subliminal messaging and their work is full of cryptic messages.

&gt; Some critics refuse to listen to their music on account that they are positive the band is trying to brainwash their listeners for unknown motivations, citing references to David Koresh and occult symbols as proof. Others approach these facts from the skeptical angle, saying it is nothing but a bunch of “cute tricks” and an ironic gesture towards people who take such things seriously (and some would say, as a bit of a similar gesture towards their own body of work in later releases, such as ""Geogaddi"").

I'm not a member, but I do like to read it from time to time.

&gt;I'd be interested in hearing why you think they have so much trouble.

The main causes of their problem are the sexual revolution and the female mating strategy. Throughout history females have always had easier access to sex than males as seen by the fact that we have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. Females have always wanted to reproduce with men with high quality genes (i.e. attractive men). Before the sexual revolution this behavior were for the most part kept in check. Even a man with low quality genes could expect to find a woman to marry and have children with. After the sexual revolution this would no longer be the case as females would rather share the top 20% of men since this would give them access to high quality genes for their offspring. This implies that the other 80% of men will have less chance of having sex than they would before the sexual revolution and thus, you get a quite large percentage of men who are involuntarily celibate.

If Donna Brazile had literally hacked into the Sanders campaign and released his emails in a story that's still news today, while also deciminating fake news about Bernie, attempted to hack into the voting machines and everything else, there might be a point.

2)Another CGDCT show but with some boys as side characters. The girls try to find out, why and how boys behave, so they crossdress the whole time.

3) A show about superpowers which are activated by shafting the genes, so that some characters have to transfer their genes to each other to modify them (this idea is fruited out of a hentai idea)

5) Ouji - hentai prince had an ouji in its title, so some sort of prince ? Kachou .... no idea, maybe a prince of gum ? (kachou is the sfx of someone eating something)

6) an anime about the longest night of a young boy being picked up on a street. The driver is some old guy, who longs for some things ... ah , I stop here

7) wordplay show with poems

8) some NEET is lonely and so he created his own waifu, the data girl. The color red is here a signal, that she is in reality a virus destroying the world and the NEET has to decide who he wants to save. The girl is really cute btw.

9) sentou = fight ? yousei = ? ? yuki = snow, kaze=wind, cold

Ok, bragging over. While this tier still getting sorted, its looking like we are the go to for stacked damage recovery moreso than other classes thanks to 4 piece. Which is a first. Normally people say we are because that's the only viable style. And then other classes just obliterate us at stacked healing anyway and still have other healing viable uses. (Druid movement)

The idea that we are the best oh poop healer thanks to mastery is a myth that I wish would just die already. That doesn't exist for progression largely.  Maybe in easy mode farm where your are cheese healing or very outgeared lower tier guilds. Shaman is tuned around those oh poop moments and raids are tuned so tight than any oh poop moment is a wipe 99% of the time regardless of the number of shaman you stack. What we do have is tons of CDs that keep us in the fight for inclusion. Namely totem of guaranteed raid slot (SLT) and totem of mechanic cheese (reincarnate).  Combined with htt, AG, weapon and velens complimenting them all. We carry CDs to deal with more mechanics than any other healer. That is our strength. Not mastery. Mastery is just part of the deal.

Edit to reply to a boob who deleted his comment on why haste.

For example, if you check the unblocked shots against chart for Ristolainen you can see that he forces more shots from the outside and often teams attack the other side in a similar fashion that a QB avoids certain defensive players. Having defensively deficient linemates hurts his advanced stats. 

I mean Taylor Fedun has a Corsi that is 4 points better than Erik Karlsson. Fedun has no noticeable impact on the game and Erik Karlsson is fuckin Erik Karlsson haha. If Corsi was that meaningful to telling the quality of a defenseman and what pairing they should be, how is it possible that a 3rd pair/AHL level defenseman has a better Corsi than arguably the best Dman in the league? 

Going with the point of the post, I will guarantee you can not find a single respected hockey analyst that believes Risto isnt currently or potentially a 1st pair dman. ",hockey
5474,"-Doomfist had already been a work in progress, same with other heroes. They didn't just release a hero and decide to make a new one after. So they don't make the decision on which class would be getting a new hero. It's about which hero is already far enough along. I'd much rather get a new offense hero now then wait to get a support and then wait more for the offense hero.

-The amount of characters in a category by no means establishes which category gets an update next. There are several heroes that have just now become viable with the release of Doomfist.

-The supports are already diverse enough. Adding a melee hero widens the game way more than another person that heals could.

And homosexuality is that golden point for the toxicity of religion IN DOCTRINE, not just in practice or execution or tradition or because of social factors, but the actual holy texts. Without religion, it's almost impossible to imagine that homosexuality should still be stigmatized to this day. There's basically no argument you can make for why it should matter that men have sex with men or women or so forth. Religion shows off what it really is - old static morality. Maybe 1500 years ago, when making kids was very useful, there was an argument. But religion has pushed the conditions of those times and made homosexuality a relevant issue to this day. ",worldnews

""Next to disease trends and outbreaks, there are other influences on case numbers which need to be taken into account in the interpretation of the case numbers.

A proportion of the increase in the number of cases of these diseases in 2015/16 can be attributed to the migratory movements as compared with previous years. However, the change in the case definitions of certain notifiable diseases in 2015 which was only step-wise implemented at local public health authorities also influences the number of cases e.g. for hepatitis B and hepatitis C.""

5717,"I'd say The Prestige. Its the best use of non linear storytelling IMO because it managed to maintain an engaging linear dramatic narrative while jumping around in time and perspective. Often it cuts to scenes without even suggesting either of the characters are thinking or reading about the past events being shown. The scripting and editing is singularly focused on the audience experience. 

Best example is the scene where Johanson's character goes to see Borden. At first we see it cut off at Borden jokingly asking ""so this is the truth is it?"". Later, when its dramatically relevant, we see her serious and venomous reply. That reply is withheld to be shown at the point it would have maximum dramatic impact *for the audience*. 

It's like the ""I lied, he said it was agony"" moment. That's actually *not* a dramatic moment for Angier because he knew cutter was lying when he'd originally said that anyway. It's a dramatic moment mostly for the audience. Cutter walking away from Angier is the main dramatic beat for the characters.

Memento is similar. Non linear yes but in service to a strong dramatic narrative.",movies

5719,"The first season was hilarious, and the second season had some high and low points, but overall it is definitely one of the funnier anime comedies. I tend to prefer that sort of style, where the comedy is from quick paced banter and visual gags rather than a single funny overreaction or skit a la Nichibros or even parts of Senyuu. 

I like for there to be a somewhat of an overarching plotline to give the entire story structure and meaning, and give me some way of relating to and caring for the characters. This was missing in Nichibros to its detriment, in my eyes, but is strongly present in Konosuba, Wagnaria, and even titles like Girl's Monthly Nozaki-kun. 

YuriYuri is a comedy I'm in the process of watching right now, which seems to be straddling the line between skits like Nichibros, and more organic interactions with an element of storytelling, but so far it has fallen on the latter side of the equation, and I really like that about it. 

Which I guess explains why I find Konosuba funny compared to other things, but not so much why I find Konosuba itself to be funny. To answer that, I'd say it is because each of the four protagonists already has a comedic element about them. Kazuma as the asshole straight man, Aqua as the super genki failure and drunkard, Megumin for amusing facial expressions, names, and her giant Achilles heel of actually being worthless in fights, and Darkness for being a masochist, but most importantly for finding masochistic pleasure in *everything* bad that happens to her. On their own these things would be worth a laugh or two, and then get old quickly, and I never enjoy scenes that focus too much on one of these elements. Like all the times that Darkness is getting beat up and loving it do nothing for me, because the gag gets old fast. But take all four of them together, and they have a lot of chemistry, their individual gags all mix together well. Particularly with the standard comedic duo of having a straight man and the funny man. Kazuma is the straight man, and the other three play off him very well. But at the same time that means when Kazuma is the one being ridiculous and waving panties around while the others judge him, it makes that all the funnier. Honestly, I thought Gigguk's video covered it pretty well, so I am sure there is some overlap between my response and his, but idk what else to tell you and this comment is already far too long. ",anime
5720,"&gt;  By contrast the judge accepted unreasonable steps, such as the fact that the kid had facial hair, which is neither reasonable, nor really a step, and did not hold that ""all steps"" need to actually be followed.

The drawing of an inference is a step for the purpose of that test. You may feel it is inadequate, and I may agree, but you can't change the test just because you're angry.

I think your point here was far better overall

&gt; when the law states ""all reasonable steps"" judges may at will replace the word ""all"" with ""some"" and remove the word ""reasonable"" and that is not an error of law.

The problem is that the sufficiency of the analysis is a factual finding, not a legal one. This is still a snazzy argument though, and one I'd have wanted made in submissions to the SCC (probably was, tbh). I think there was probably room for the SCC to say that the trial judge erred in law by lowering the threshold required of the test. They might have had to modify or codify the test a little more, make it a little more strict. I haven't read the whole judgment though, just headnote and the cbc article.",canada

Tohru has little reason to like her other than the fact that they came from the same world and hasn't sided with her in an argument in the series' run.

2nd: Lucoa *really* doesn't give a fuck. Not about Shota, not about the dragons (good to remember she isn't one), and especially not about humans. The world around her (from her perspective) pretty much exists to entertain her. Nothing more. She has no reason to care about standards placed on her by humans. 

This to add to the fact that the dub's rhetoric, while it does exist in some areas of the world, do not nessecarily  (and from a gaijin's perspective, *do not*) exist in Japan. There isn't the history of active, open discrimination that there is/was (or in the way there is/was) in the (post)colonial world. Japan never had a Stonewall or the riots that happened around it. They just adopted (marriage) laws similar to the West (read: USA) in order to look more like the rich (read: Western) countries, and that unfortunately included not giving LGB people the same marriage rights. 

Tl;dr they changed things in an attempt to localize, but in doing so misrepresented the characters, the setting (urban Japan), and the themes of the work.

&gt; William DeVaughn (b 1948, Washington D.C.) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known for the hit song ""Be Thankful for What You Got"".
DeVaughn was a salaried government employee as a drafting technician (according to Casey Kasem,[citation needed] he designed sewers), part-time singer,[1] and member of the Jehovah's Witnesses.[citation needed] He wrote ""[ ""[ A Cadillac Don`t Come Easy eventually re-written to become""Be Thankful for What You Got ""(song)|in 1972, and spent $900 toward its development to Omega Sound [A Philadelphia Production House][2] The producers at Omega [Frank Fioravanti and John Davis wanted to go for a nasty groove and wrote an smooth arrangement ,eventually booking time to record at the famous Sigma Sound Studio in Philadelphia Remarkably, the session featured members of the MFSB group - guitarist Norman Harris, drummer Earl Young, bassist Ron Baker, and vibist Vince Montana - these top musicians were secured by Allan Felder, who also developed the separate adlib back -up chorus with his Sister`s vocal choir. .[3]Frank Fioravanti, could have released the record on the companies own label Sound Gems but it was just starting out and instead secured its release on the Roxbury Records record label..&gt;[4]
The record sold nearly two million copies on its release in spring 1974, reaching #1 on the U.S. R&amp;B charts and #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a million copies.[5] With a sound and content influenced by Curtis Mayfield, its simple and encouraging lyrics hit home, to the extent that it became featured on gospel radio stations. When his success as a recording artist seemed guaranteed, DeVaughn quit his government job.
DeVaughn released an album, featuring mostly songs of an overtly religious character, and the second single, ""Blood Is Thicker Than Water"", made the R&amp;B top ten and the pop top fifty later in 1974; ""Give the Little Man a Great Big Hand"" had minor success early the next year.[6] Live, DeVaughn preached to and admonished his audience from the stage. He lost interest in the music industry not long after, working in a record store and again as a draftsman. Fioravanti kept Devaughn under contract hoping to eventually get recording again but it wasn`t until 1980 that they would hook-up for new projects. Fioravanti made a mistake by giving the new album Figures Can't Calculate' to ' (TEC Records) included the title song, which was a minor R&amp;B hit, and a remake of ""Be Thankful for What You Got"".TEC never paid out any royalties. Still though soon after Devaughn recorded another Fioravanti tune ""Creme de Creme "" released in Europe on the ""Red Bus"" label. Until this point in time Fioravanti produced or co-produced all of the singles and albums.

&gt; In 2004, DeVaughn released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

&gt; In 2004 he released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.

&gt; In that same year, rapper Ludacris sampled this song[dubious – discuss] for ""Diamond in the Back"" on his album Chicken and Beer. It uses DeVaughn's beat and his voice is used throughout the chorus. Read more on Last.fm.

Facebook also puts news stories into your feed (about every 10th item) based on what users with similar patterns as you like. 

So, hypothetically, a bunch of people could analyse data about you, make a bunch of fake accounts, then like and share stories that you would like and share, so facebook builds up a data-based profile of those fake accounts which resembles you.

Once that's done, they can start sharing and liking fake news between these accounts and, by doing so, increase the chance that facebook will display them to you. If you like, share, or even just dwell on it for awhile before scrolling, that'll increase its propagation.

Think about it, the people telling you this are sample people making millions selling the more expensive ""non-fat"" or ""low-fat"" foods which are just as bad if not worse for you than the original. The truth of the matter that fat is a crucial part of our diet, especially from healthy sources such as nuts, fish, healthy oils like olive or coconut (corn and vegetable oil/pam are owned by the same people who sell the ""non-fat"" foods).

Eating a moderate to high amounts of fat is not unhealthy and does not lead to obesity as we are led to believe through the subliminal advertisements. Don't believe me, try and find one example of someone who changed from ""full-fat"" to ""non-fat"" or ""reduced-fat"" foods and left everything else constant that saw ANY health improvements.

A good amount of fats from food are necessary for us to survive. It's the high sodium, high sugar, high simple carbohydrates especially high fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners that have really led to the health problems in America vs other countries, not excess fat in diets.

Even though he had no probable cause.

Luckily I smoked before I left, and it isn't illegal to be high if you're not hurting anyone.

6116,"I can attempt to explain, but TBH you don't sound like you're altogether very interested in the explanation.

Take the various Islamic extremist factions to have cropped up in the last 15-20 years. Most of them, if they could get away with it, would have absolutely no problem whatsoever with bringing their backwards thinking to Canada. Were it not for the fact we are extremely fucking lucky insofar as geography goes, they'd have very likely tried by now (see also: Europe). That same backwards thinking sees things like the charter as entirely incompatible, and would set it on fire if that was all it would take to render it useless.

We are never going to be directly in the line of fire just on basic principle, given our geographic location and the fact if anyone wanted to aim at North America they'd likely aim at the US. But we value the exact same rights, more or less, as places like the UK. Much in the same way that we shouldn't be okay with rights being violated in Canada, we should be equally not okay with rights being violated in allied countries, or countries under our protection. Unfortunately, that's going to mean getting our hands dirty.

The long and short of it is they're called *international* human rights for a reason. The charter is just Canada's attempt at carrying out those rights--which is how free speech laws in Canada become significantly different from those in the US, despite both countries having the right to free speech.

TL, DR: No international human rights, no charter. No enforcement, no international human rights.

The acting was on point for the needs of the film, as was the soundtrack which suited the growing tension of the film. 

The sound design was excellent, the sound of the firing of Browning 303's in the Spitfires and other sounds and **the shrieks of the Ju-87 Stukas**... I have never watched a movie that made the Stuka sound as terrifying as this. Was in awe at the screech and how others reacted to them. They did the Sirens justice in this film.

It is too bad that they could not get an actual BF-109E instead of the Spanish versions but I can overlook that. The fighter combat and details of operation in combat and flight management were authentic to me. Was great.

As a history nerd, I approve of this film. Encapsulated Dunkirk very well.

My view is that the best taxation scheme is one that takes more from those that have it than from those that don't, and provides assistance to those who need it rather than those who don't.

Inheritance style taxes are exactly this kind of tax.  People with poor parents don't have to think about this tax because they can't expect their parents to give them anything.  People with rich parents are affected because their parents are rich enough to give them something.  Rather than inheriting 100% of the value their parents will them, they may only inherit 85% of it.  That seems perfectly fair.

There may be a rare situation where the only thing someone inherits is a property, like a cottage, and no money at all.  In that situation, the only way to pay the taxes is to sell the property, or to take out a reverse-mortgage on it to try to pay off the taxes.  Even then, that person is inheriting something of value and paying only a small amount of taxes in that exchange.  While I have sympathy for that person if they have an emotional attachment to the property, it's still one of the better forms of taxation.",canada

Obviously SSY's more morally gray than that. [SSY](/s ""He targeted innocent people after all. But considering the facts of their society, he was left with no other rational choice beyond submitting to their system for his entire life and changing nothing. The Telekenetics were nigh-unstoppable unless Squealer came up with a plan to turn one of them against the rest. Perhaps the way he did it took it too far, but did it really? Was there any other possible way he could've done what he did without doing it the way he did? And he couldn't leave a single one alive because one was enough to kill every queer rat colony."")

[] (/s ""Honestly, I think SSY is so fascinating to me because it sort of justifies genocide. What happens when one group holds true complete and absolute power over others and use it to unequivocally enslave them and slaughter them by thousands on a while? That's clearly bad, yet that's exactly what the Telekenetics did. Is it alright, then, for the enslaved to rebel? Naturally, I don't think anyone in their right mind would disagree with that. But what is the cost of rebellion? Is there any too high? What if you must literally slaughter every single telekenetic to be free? Genocide of people based on ability though? Isn't that wrong? Hell, that's literally the entire overarching plot of X-men, and most people are on the X-men's side. Yet in the SSY universe, people are shown to work under the philosophy that with great power comes great corruption. As soon as telekenetics sprung into existence, the world ended. Only thousands of years later did a tenuous, arguable incredibly unethical balance come about due to scientific ingenuity regarding genetics and brain chemistry."")

[](/s ""But then from another approach, TKs are literally the next evolution of humanity and queer rats are literally a step back. Do the circumstances of how they got there matter in the grand scheme of things? As long as TKs can't kill one another, their society is essentially utopic. Would it be better if there were no queer rats to enslave at all and there were just the advanced humans? These are questions I don't think anyone has the answer to. Squealer certainly didn't. All Squealer was doing was acting on behalf of his people, which I don't think anyone can blame him for. In his eyes, all of his actions were justified because his people had mass injustice done to them for hundreds of years if not longer."")

And that was way longer and got way off tangent. But I think it all needed to be said. Philosophy is weird and completely arbitrary. To Squealer, the needs of his own people outweighed those of his enemies. No one could possibly blame him for that. If I were a queer rat, I'd certainly vote for him.

Yi is over 3k with an atmog's build (don't play him, so I don't know exactly), gets 70 AD, gets 80% AS from his R active, and is slow immune for 12 seconds but refreshes that on kill.

Kind of the same goes for Trump, he very public and very explicitly attacked a few of Trump policies/position, most notably with his ""make our planet great again"" tweet.

6390,"Hi friend, 

This is actually a topic I love to talk about. I spent the last four years working with men getting out of prison. A large portion of which was spent getting guys jobs where they were treated and compensated fairly. It was a tough but rewarding gig. My point was to simply say that if a depth receiver had committed Vick's crime, and served his sentence, he almost certainly would not have gotten a job afterwards. Vick ONLY got that opportunity because he was at one point in time a transcendent player. 

I think you're making a few hiccups. First, all crimes are not viewed equally. For whatever reason people are more apt to hire a theft or drug offender rather than a murder offender. This in spite of the statistics OVERWHELMINGLY showing that people with chargers of murder 1 are the best parolees and have the most successful lives after prison. It's unfortunate but in our current climate (it's probably getting worse honestly) it is what it is. Second, do not fool yourself into thinking the american criminal justice system is rehabilitative. It is strictly punitive. Any rehabilitation that happens is fought for tooth and nail by social workers who are under staffed, under resourced and under paid. ",nfl

The US has the highest Healthcare system per capita at around $8000/person and is one of the few first-world countries with a life expectancy below 80 years.  

The overall benefit of having a Universal Healthcare system is that people have better access to medical care.  This means people don't wait until they're deathly ill which costs a lots more than if it were prevented in the first place.  It might seem counter-intuitive but when a government plays a role in paying for healthcare is ends up being much cheaper per capita.

6518,"&gt;There is no such thing as a safe anything. In both examples, a state decides to enforce medical procedures upon those who may disagree.

It's about risk management because the risk of getting a deadly disease, if not vaccinated is far greater then having a bad reaction to a vaccine, so no comparison there. 

Secondly, a state is responsible for all its citizens. Therefore a government have to minimize the risks for all people and is entitled to deny you access to for example schools as long as you pose a risk.  
&gt;And I guess you do not believe in things like right to bodily autonomy (or human rights per se).

As I said: You as a person have the right to opt out, if you don't want but it has consequences. 

&gt;Hahahaha, yeah, right. ""Don't bother, I am sure I will win"". That works everytime.

Well, if you leave out the part where i explain why, I can't help you. 
Anyway to be sure I'll explain it again:
The risk of getting a deadly disease or one which leaves permanent damage is far greater than having a bad reaction to a vaccine (btw. usually doctors stop vaccinating as soon as they figure out that there are some complications). 
Live is about risk management and reasonable people try to minimize risks because you can't live without so they wear a seatbelt while driving or look left and right before crossing the street. 
This is something they teach their children too.

&gt;So somehow, magically, my kid has less human rights than I do? That's a fucked up world you want to live in.

Here is the magic trick: When your kid is old enough he / she can opt out, but up until this point you are acting in his / her best interest. Being healthy is in his / her best interest. 
Herd immunity and for that matter a low count on child deaths is a public interest, so it is just natural to require basic vaccinations because public interest correlates with the interest of the child.  
And don't pretend a vaccination is like amputating an arm or a leg. 

&gt;They are not zero, therefore from an ethical standpoint, they may not be mandatory.

Well as I said: As soon as the doctor notices complications, he will stop the vaccination (and at this point your kid relies on herd immunity). 

Edit: An example to further clarify may point: You are, in most western countries, a free person and therefore free to decide whether to leave a place or not. Now let's imagine you are on an airplane and you decide to leave during flight. They are not going to let you. They probably going to anesthetize you too because you pose a risk to all people on board. ",europe

6541,"Hi ! I'm back again with more Monogatari watch order debate :P

Last year I made [this watch order chart](http://imgur.com/gallery/3uWkJlB). This was a pretty simple, to-the-point chart, very easy to follow for someone completely new to Monogatari. This was in January 2016, and Kizu wasn't available yet, so I didn't include it directly, but I put a note saying that the intended place is between Bake and Nise. I don't think anyone complained about it at the time :D

I'm planning to update this chart once Owari S2 is out (so I can put the exact layout of the arcs in term of number of episodes). I added some cool things, but the idea stays the same : something easy to follow without any additional work. I only needed to add Kizu at its intended place.

Then, the last Kizu movie was subbed, which means newcomers could finally watch it directly after Bake and not have to endure years of waiting like we did. However, I was still seeing some people suggest the true airing order, including Kizu after everything, which didn't make sense in my mind. So I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6n9nn4/psa_about_monogatari_series_now_that_the_third/) to defend the ""Kizu second"" order.

Oh boy, mistakes were made.

First, I apologize to everyone who saw this post as something condescending or off-putting. I was so attached to what was, in my mind, the only order that made sense, that I just talked exactly as if any other order was stupid and only stupid people wouldn't understand that. That was not my intention at all, and I was completely in the wrong. Sorry about that.

A lot of comments discussed the viability of the airing order or other variations, but two comments, in particular, made me realize I was being closed-minded and opened my perspective. I edited my original post to include these comments, because they looked so right to me.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/6n8mdz/psa_now_that_the_third_kizu_movie_is_available/dk7ztwg/) by /u/Kotomine-kun's made me understand that you could just let the viewer decide : if he does want an extra element of mystery, and is open to rewatching the series after watching Kizu to make sense of earlier arcs that needed the added context, then he could decide to watch Kizu late in the series.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6n9nn4/psa_about_monogatari_series_now_that_the_third/dk7v0xc/) by /u/Sinrus, especially the third block, made me consider the ""Kizu between Owari and Koyomi"" order. Once I read his explanation, this particular order (which is still different from the airing order, but not much) made so much sense to me. The gist is, you get Shinobu Mail at the end of Owari, which is the last big Shinobu-related arc, and then you watch Kizu with the perspective of Shinobu Mail in mind, and it ""transports"" you to the beginning of the Monogatari timeline, which you traverse again from that point with Koyomimonogatari, building up until the last arc, with Owari S2 following immediately after. It feels so beautiful to me, I can't thank /u/Sinrus enough for his suggestion.

(Sorry for the lengthy rant)

Now, after all of this, my position is that you shouldn't try to recommend a watch order over another (which is exactly what I did, but I came to realize why I shouldn't have). It would be best to take the neutral way, by explaining the different possibilities and let the viewer decide which way is the one he thinks he would prefer. A lot of people liked the added mystery of not being able to see the events of Kizu until the end, but there are also a lot of people, me included, that disliked it for one reason or another. 

So, I've started to add a [new section](http://imgur.com/a/058PD) at the top of my chart, to do exactly that. That way, someone new to the series could decide which experience will be the best for him. Nothing in that picture is definitive, so if you have other suggestions (maybe different watch orders or variations), feel free to suggest it.

The only problem with this is, I'm afraid it will have the opposite effect of intimidating the viewer instead of helping him make sense of the series. With the first version of the chart, he just had to take a glance at it to understand which episode he should start with. If he has to read all of this before even starting the series, he might just react like ""wow, this looks so confusing, I don't have time for that, I'll watch it later"". It would be a pity to miss the Monogatari experience for such a reason, but I really can't decide between adding this section to let the viewer decide, or just pick an order (like Kizu between Bake and Nise) and just present it without any explanation or even indication that there are other possible orders.

And since I can't decide, I wanted to gauge your opinion with that poll. What would be the best option ? Including this section, which leaves the most freedom to the newcomer, but also adds the risk of confusing him ? Or keeping it simple, like the January 2016 version ?

&gt; There seem to be four artists with this name:

&gt; 1. Rhino is a Spanish sludge doom band formed in Bilbao, 2004. Now called Horn Of The Rhino.

&gt; With big experience on their backs and with influences of the most bestial rock, the sickest doom and the heaviest metal, born in Bilbao, Rhino, a band that delivers brutal and monolithic songs with blasting guitars, thundering apocalyptic drums and aggressive vocals. Plus the attitude of their members and the obscurity of their songwriting, Rhino is shown as one of the most punishing, arrogant and merciless bands of their country. Formed in December of 2004 by Javier Gálvez, guitars and vocals, (Burial, From The Cross, Left Hand Riders) and Julen Gil, drums (Subliminal, Positiva) the band released in January of 2006 their demo “ Name the horn bearer” with Miguel Moral on bass and start to gain recognition as a brutal live act. At the beginning of 2007 and after a year of hard work on the stage along bands like Moho, Shisha Pangma, Bort, Moksha or Warchetype, Sergio Robles replaced M. Moral on bass just before the band released in april the critically acclaimed debut album Breed The Chosen One (OdioSonoro/7th Gate Records), produced by Rubén ZeaMays, and get great reviews from the media such as Terrorizer (UK), Rock Hard (SP), Metal Maniacs (USA) or This Is Rock (SP). After playing in several summer festivals ( Portugal's Bracara Extreme Fest, Gernika's Agroskate…) and shows with bands like Gorefest, Monarch, Lords of Bukkake, Taint or Grey Daturas, Rhino gets signed to Arctic Music Group(USA) for the release, in summer 08, of their new album Dead Throne Monarch.

&gt; Current members:
* Javier Gálvez - Guitar &amp; Vocals

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fd757fce263c4ff69a8291123323be93.png)  

&gt; The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter, novelist, pianist and guitarist John Darnielle. He has the distinction of being named by the The New Yorker magazine as 'America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist'; in its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine dubbed Darnielle one of the '100 Best Living Songwriters'. Darnielle’s lyrics are erudite and compassionate and filled with imagery that reference classical literature, religion, mythology, culture, art, and history. Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on Tallahassee are fictional, but that We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and other more recent work are partially autobiographical.

&gt; Darnielle began performing under the name the Mountain Goats in 1991 in Claremont, California, where he attended Pitzer College and worked as a psychiatric nurse. The band's name, the Mountain Goats, is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song Yellow Coat. Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band, The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

&gt; Highly prolific, since the early 90s Darnielle has released over a dozen Mountain Goats albums, 6 full-length cassettes, various 7” singles, 10"" and 12"" EPs and has contributed to compilations and label samplers too numerous to mention. As of November 2006, the Mountain Goats’ song catalog encompasses 452 songs, a fair number of which have only been played live. Among this bewildering number of tunes is a song cycle named the “Alpha” series, about a dysfunctional couple, as well as one named the “Going To…” series, about people going someplace or other, usually not for fun but rather to flee from a bad situation in their lives. The last series alone totals over 40 songs to date.  Additional song cycles from Darnielle's extensive repertoire include the ""Standard Bitter Love Song #..."" series, the ""Orange Ball Of..."" series, and the ""Pure..."" series, as well as a series of songs whose titles are simply chapters and verses from the Bible (""I Corinthians 13 8-10"", etc.).

&gt; Although his last six albums (since Darnielle signed with 4AD Records) have seen more hi-fi production values, most of the Mountain Goats' recorded output is extremely lo-fi, the only accompaniment to Darnielle’s razor-sharp lyrics being an acoustic guitar and the occasional input of backing vocals, and then the sound of the tape recorder permeating the track at all times, effectively serving as a backing track in its own right.

&gt; In addition to his work with The Mountain Goats, Darnielle has also collaborated with Franklin Bruno (of Nothing Painted Blue) in The Extra Glenns (later named The Extra Lens).

&gt; Darnielle’s song ""Cotton"" was featured in the Showtime show Weeds. It can be heard in the middle and at the end of the 9th episode, The Punishment Light.

&gt; The songs ""No Children,"" ""Old College Try,"" and ""Love Love Love"" were each featured in separate episodes of the television series Moral Orel's third season, which has featured major running themes of alcoholism, regret, and domestic discontent.

Tanks: Cho (will not be top after 7.15 probably), Maokai, Shen and in niche cases Galio (mostly mid these days).

Jungle: Zac, Elise, Gragas, Kha, Cho, Mao, Seju, Kha, Rek'sai, Rumble and Lee. Yeah, we have a tank majority there, but also some none tanks. Does that one role with a tank majority make it a tank meta?

People should start differentiating between a tank meta and a TANKY meta.

And that AD assassins don't show up when Tanks or tanky champs are there is also wrong (to a certain degree). Earlier this season we had Talon and Zed even with a top lane being mostly dominated by tanks and Camille. We also had Lth Jayce and Lth ADCs at that time. The Assassin just wants to hit the ADC or mid laner and he needs a good laning matchp. If he can splitpish a bit in the 1-3-1 or flank it is ok. We had AD assassins with tanks or tanky champs more than once. Sure, they need to be more careful and have less targets, but in a time where people call all of them OP as fuck due to DB in soloQ they should be viable (except all the soloQ specialists are wrong, which is more likely due to the stats not showing any AD assassin being OP).",leagueoflegends

&gt;This promise did sway many votes and clearly he never intended to follow through.

Hard to say, I'd say no. It's not a going concern for most Canadians only hardcore ND. They wouldn't likely vote liberal just for that. 

&gt;Expenditures, budgets and forecasts are all public. As are all the external reports that are available to all parties. It isn't true that opposition parties don't have good information before taking government.

The ruling party can actually change things, like sell off assets or deffer expenditure commitments. 

&gt;I don't think deficits are over sold as a concern. If I run continued deficits in my business, I will go out of business. We are not in dire economic times right now and it makes no sense to be racking up debt.

The topic is massively oversold, the government isn't a business. The key reason people are over concerned is they have no idea why that's important. It prints it's own money, most of the debt is owed to it's own people. A government can print more, devaluing their currency to cover debts. There is limits to this and it causes problems but not at the levels of debt we're in. 

The problem with excessive debt is difficulty in getting more borrowers. But that line is much higher than our current debt levels. We're at about 80% gross government debt to GDP, Japan is over 230%, the US over 100%. We have to be in so much debt that there are concerns about our ability to pay it. That threshold is way higher than were we're at.

Courtois in goal, with a back three of Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Kompany. Fellaini in front with Nainggolan and Dembele playing b2b with KDB tip of the diamond, then front three of Hazard, Mertens, Lukaku. That way they fit all their top players in their natural positions.

6685,"""Just talk to them"" is dumb advice.

I mean obviously, you should just talk to them, but it's not that easy. What's needed here is advice on how to get the courage to just talk to them without being excruciatingly awkward. For this, I offer the following;

Play a game in your head. You are a skilled and experienced secret agent, on a mission disguised as an ordinary person. Expertly applied make-up makes you look like an average individual instead of the mind-shatteringly attractive deity you saw in your mirror this morning just after getting out of bed. The person you want, no, *need* to talk to is your mark. You don't know anything about them, except that this morning an anonymous man on the street slipped you an envelope sealed with the official HQ cryptographic seal, containing a photo of your mark, and instructions to find out what you can about them, without them suspecting. HQ wants to know where they're from, what kind of work they do, what they do for fun, their opinions about some things that are in the news, and whatever else you can glean. Any detail about these things may be useful, so don't worry about why HQ wants the information, that's not your job.

So this is a person you *have to* talk to, because it's a matter of national security. You aren't interested in them, and it doesn't matter if they aren't interested in you (but if you can get them to be, that might be useful). You're just having a casual friendly conversation, you don't want them to suspect anything, but whenever there's a reasonable opportunity, you ask a question about them and try to get them talking about themselves. You have to pay close attention because you're going to need to compile a report from memory, and you might hear things that can open up new questions. If you are asked about yourself, talk about your cover story (real life). Keep it plausible and interesting, to make sure they want to stay in the conversation, but don't go on too long, since it's not advancing your mission.

Fun fact: Fake confidence works just as well as the real stuff, and has half the calories. After a little while you may find that the secret agent thing isn't necessary any more, and you're just having an engaging conversation with the person.",AskReddit

6702,"I got involved with Amway about 20 years ago when I was in the military. My ""sponsor"" was a Special Forces soldier, a Green Beret, who I worked with. In fact several levels of my ""upline"" were Green Berets. 

When Joe Schmoe shows up at the local Starbucks and tries making buddy-buddy with you and springs some circles-and-lines drawing, it's easy to say ""this don't look right."" But when a Green Beret or SEAL shows up, you might be more willing to listen. 

The Amway distributor organizations know this pretty well and started spreading a message of ""it works if you work hard"" to a bunch of ultra-Type-A guys whose whole motto in life is ""work hard."" And they're in the military, when at that time the pay wasn't so great even for the elite guys, so the promised ""six-figure income"" was a big selling point.

I stayed active for a little over a year, worked hard trying to recruit, etc. but I myself was not a Green Beret and had little success.

People tend to feel strongly about something when they've spent money on it.

&gt; but barely anyone is addressing Blizzard on a level field. 

One of the major points is that this is not a level field to begin with.  Blizzard takes in over a billion dollars a year.  Everything is stacked in their favor.

&gt; And the people who feel they've been wronged are shutting down opposition by labeling them ""fanboys"". 

It seems an apt term for people who mindlessly defend the anti-customer practices of a billion-dollar corporation that has its own legal and PR departments, people who cannot distinguish criticism of a *game* or a *company* from *the people who play the game made by the company*, thinking that any criticism of Blizzard is a criticism of themselves, personally, who then react emotionally with personal attacks against the OP, who in no way criticized the fanboy.

&gt; The extent of self-entitledness here is extremely prohibitive to any constructive discussion.

This ""entitledness"" theme is a cop-out, a way to avoid actual discussion by insulting everyone on the other side of the issue.

I call up Rogers and tell them somebody is trying to defraud me and to put a freeze on and activity on my account outside of regular billing.

&gt; Celtic Woman is a musical group from Dublin, Ireland comprising five Irish women with a repertoire that ranges from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs. Current members include the five vocalists  Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, Máiréad Carlin, Susan McFadden, Lynn Hilary, Alex Sharpe, and the violinist Máiréad Nesbitt. Deirdre Shannon sang with the group during Ní Mhaolchatha's pregnancy in 2005-2006. Hayley Westenra, a New Zealander of Irish descent, sang with the group during its 2006-2007 tour as its sixth member. Méav Ní Mhaolchatha and Órla Fallon were two of the original members of the group, though both have since left to pursue other projects.

&gt; In 2007, Ní Mhaolchatha left the group to focus on her solo career and was replaced by Hilary. Sharpe initially joined the group to fill in for Kelly who was on maternity leave, and later became a full member as a replacement for Fallon (who left to spend more time with family and record a solo work).

&gt; Since then, both Alex Sharpe and Lynn Hilary have left, making way for Lisa Lambe.

&gt; In 2013, Lisa Kelly left to pursue a teaching career at a Voice Academy she started up that year with her husband, making way for Susan McFadden for the 2013 Believe Tour.

&gt; In 2013, Chloë Agnew left to pursue solo work, making way for Máiréad Carlin. 

&gt; Celtic Woman was recorded on September 15, 2004 for PBS Television in The United States at The Helix, Dublin to a sell-out audience. The show was organized by show producer Sharone Browne and musical director and composer David Downes, and produced by Dave Kavanagh. The show was first broadcast in March 2005 in The United States and within weeks the album Celtic Woman reached number one in the World Music charts in America and on Amazon.com charts. Their huge success in Asia and in America has been credited to the already successful megastar Enya and has been called ""Riverdance for the Voice"". As of July 22, 2006 the group has broken a long standing record in the music business. Their CD has been at the #1 position on the Billboard charts for an amazing 68 weeks.

&gt; On October 19th of that year, Celtic Woman was knocked off its No.1 spot on Billboard's World Music Charts, which it had maintained for 82 weeks, by Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration. This put the groups' 2 CDs at Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. Since then, Lisa Lambe has left the group to pursue a solo career. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; NOFX is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 1983. The original lineup included singer/bassist Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin, and guitarist Eric Melvin. Since 1991, the lineup has remained the same, with El Hefe playing guitar and trumpet. They have released 11 full-length studio albums, 15 EPs, 2 live albums, and many 7"" singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent acts of all time.

&gt; The band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of skate punk, hardcore punk, reggae, and other music genres. Their lyrics generally satirize issues such as politics, society, various subcultures, racism, the music industry, and religion, often using a large amount of comedy.

&gt; NOFX's first recording was a demo from 1983, produced by The Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell any copies. They released their self-titled debut EP on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum RocknRoll CD. For a year, Erik Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, then Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released So What if We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This!, attacking the PMRC's call for censorship of music. The original cover was an edited S&amp;M photo, but the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin.

&gt; Eric Sandin returned and they recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 (before Dave was replaced by Steve) with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after he wrote Liberal Animation. 'If a big enough animal had a chance it would eat you up!' The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph. Dave then left the band and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller. NOFX had signed to Epitaph by 1989, releasing their second album, titled S&amp;M Airlines. 1990 saw the release of Ribbed. By 1991, Aaron Abeyta (aka El Hefe), joined to round out the group. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Beanwas released in 1992, which originally had the title White Trash, Two Kikes, and a Spic. The original title was changed because Eric Melvin's grandmother was upset about the racial epithets.

&gt; It was not until the 1994 release of Punk in Drublic that the band had a commercial breakthrough, with the album going gold. In the same year, pop punk entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring's Smash and Green Day's Dookie. 

&gt; In 1996 they released Heavy Petting Zoo, which wasn't very popular among its fans because it showed a different sound in some tracks. Their 1997 record So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes was faster, with more ska and reggae, and was well received by the public, although its title shocked everybody because it seemed as it was going to be their last album. They soon stated it wasn't true.

&gt; In 1999, the band released The Decline, a fiery and pessimistic social commentary. Having a duration of 18 minutes and 23 seconds, it is nearly the longest punk song to date, second only to ""Yes Sir, I Will"" by Crass, which spans more than 22 minutes.

&gt; The coming of a new century marked the end of NOFX in Epitaph Records. In 2000 they released Pump Up the Valuum, which in many people's opinion is a good record but still is missing something.

&gt; In 2003, NOFX released War on Errorism, and launched their anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website Punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush compilations, and kicked off a Rock Against Bush United States tour. The band has released many EPs (i.e. Fuck the Kids, The Longest Line) on Fat Mike's own label Fat Wreck Chords. In February 2005, they launched the NOFX 7"" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new EP almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these EPs were chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the EPs.

&gt; On March 14, 2006, an EP entitled Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL07 was released, featuring the title track of the latter album on its soundtrack.

&gt; The band recorded three nights of shows in San Francisco, California for the live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! that was released on November 20, 2007.

&gt; NOFX aired in 2008 a reality show on Fuse TV called NOFX: Backstage Passport, chronicling their recent worldwide tour full of mishaps and fun stuff.

&gt; NOFX released their eleventh full length, Coaster, on April 28, 2009.

&gt; NOFX will release their twelfth full length, Self/Entitled, on September 11th, 2012.

6967,"&gt; How would you define CGDCT?

A slice of life comedy featuring a cast entirely or almost entirely made up of young girls drawn in a very 'cutesy' style. 

&gt; What elements make a show a CGDCT or not a CGDCT?

Too much or too little drama, for one. For instance, a show like Love Live or Girls und Panzer I would disqualify for being too goal oriented. I would consider them sports or idol shows instead. On the other hand, a show like Flying Witch I wouldn't consider a cute girl show either due to there being too little going on. I feel like they need to be comfy, but also comedic. 

I *don't* think they necessarily have to be a certain age, though. New Game has a cast of adults, but I would certainly consider it a CGDCT show.  

&gt; What show is the most true CGDCT? (As in the best example of what a CGDCT is)

Something like Kiniro Mosaic or GochiUsa. Non Non Biyori, Azumanga Daioh, and K-On are the *best* CGDCT shows, but they have more going for them than just cute girls. 

&gt; Do you consider the following shows to be a CGDCT Show?

The closest that I would actually consider a CGDCT show are Demi-chan and Teekyuu. From what I've seen, anyway. GJ-Bu would definitely be one if the MC weren't a guy, though. ",anime

I look at it this way, you can study a character in-motion or still. You can move through time and watch her attitude shift, or you can stay in one time and develop nuances and complexities in her current attitude. The former is better in a tale about growth, the latter is better in a more stationary tale (or for non-main characters). In a slice-of-life, for example, you simply want to know the characters more deeply. It's not like all the people who write slice-of-life have failed writing 101 or anything.

&gt; Gift of Gab (Tim Parker) and Chief Xcel (Xavier Mosley) met at John F. Kennedy High School in 1987 in Sacramento, California and formed the group in early 1992. They released their first recording, ""Swan Lake"", on Solesides Records. The Solesides Crew consisted of the duo, as well as other friends of theirs they had met at University of California - Davis, including DJ Shadow, Lyrics Born and Lateef the Truth Speaker. The single was an underground hit, but label trouble prevented the duo from immediately capitalizing on their fame.

&gt; In late 1997, Solesides became Quannum Projects and in 1999 Blackalicious released the A2G EP, which served as a precursor to their debut full length album, Nia, which was released the following year. This was followed by a major label contract with MCA Records and the release of the critically acclaimed album Blazing Arrow in 2002.

&gt; In May 2004 Gift of Gab released his first solo album, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, but he assured fans that Blackalicious was alive and well.

7050,"It's not a bad fake at all, but there are numerous inconsistencies with how blizzard does reveal trailers that lead me to say it's fake. Of course, never say never, so it could just be an incredibly early storyboard, but i find that unlikely.

For one thing, when blizzard introduces a new playable race, the backdrop is at least related to that race. In the cata trailer, goblins are revealed in The Lost Isles, and worgen in Gilneas. For MoP Pandaren were revealed to be playable in The Wandering Isle. Even the updated character models had a Frostfire Ridge backdrop.

They also tend to show animations for new races, not just a static preview of them standing around. 

Let's look at the first thing you see in this video. The forsaken ship looks identical to the one we already see in game (The Queen's Reprisal in Azsuna is a handy example). If Blizzard was truly giving us player ships, the reveal would be a more impressive, customized model, usually whichever is most finished (class halls were revealed with Paladin class hall because that was done first). I can't confirm because I don't play Alliance, but that boat looks like it could be in the game right now as well.

Speaking of the first thing you see, the text. It looks like they're trying to imitate the Legion font. But every reveal trailer has its own font. There's a distinct lack of polish to the font as well. Past trailer fonts have a sheen or a shadow to them, or both. They also tend to have a 3d effect to them.

Others have already pointed out the inconsistency of the name of ""Illidan's nagas"" and that it's a typo (nagas is not the plural of naga).

Perhaps the biggest sign to me that this is a fake is that every single reveal trailer Blizzard has done for a WoW expansion ends the same way, and this one does not.

A WoW Reveal trailer *always* ends with the new expansion's logo and name being revealed. Every single reveal has done this, even the BC one. Nothing else is ever revealed after the expansion logo, legion has links to other WoW videos but that's it. Similarly, when Blizz has a big villain behind an expansion they usually show them before the logo, or even just before it, but never after. Also when they're ready to show the big villain they *show* the villain, even if the model isn't ready (Deathwing was revealed with concept art).

The spirit Vol'jin is incredibly out of place. He would be earlier in the trailer if anywhere, but certainly not at the end.

So...yeah. Decent fake, but definitely fake, unless this is what the quality looks like in development, but i'm pretty sure the logo not being the final thing confirms this as fake.",wow

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

The boys are looking fresh, I really like the colour scheme going on, and I suspect the song is really going to grow on me. 


I am so pleased that Kuwabara won, and that he won in style. Whilst a flyswatter might not be the most glamorous thing, his one-liner beforehand definitely made it cool. I’m also pretty pleased that he did confront Yusuke about the whole Genkai thing – I think it was a conversation they definitely needed to have. Kuwabara deserved an explanation, and Yusuke did need to voice his feelings. I also thought that Yusuke’s recognition of his coping mechanisms really does show a growing maturity.


Sakyo’s bet did seem a bit ridiculous at first, but his discussion of his past with Toguro went some way to contextualising his mindset. In a way, most of what he described seemed pretty realistic for a consummate gambler…uh, except that whole part about killing animals in the backroom of a pet shop. That was just a little bit extreme. I am really interested to see what Shizuru really does make of this all. To me, she seemed saddened, but not appalled. ",anime

Don't ever swerve for deer, but swerving for moose isn't usually a bad idea. ",canada

From my perspective rich doesn't mean productive... not convinced the Kardasian's are vital to our economy.

And, assuming that the rich are actually involved with a means of production, it seems that it would be the means that are valuable as apposed to the person in receipt of the wealth. If the Waltons left the country it would affect very few apart from the staff they use directly so long as Walmart -- the organization and its infrastructure -- remained in place. And if the Walton's did take Walmart out of the US it's not like it would be unreasonable to assume someone would replicate the organization as the market has remained in the U.S. for such an organization. 

As long as there is a profitable market for something there will be someone to profit from it -- the rich do not create markets, they merely create means of servicing those markets, means that more often than not could be replicated. The rich do nothing but leverage their assets to these ends.",worldnews

&gt; CARACAS - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory on Monday in an internationally criticised election to pick a new assembly to rewrite the constitution, but the opposition vowed to keep protesting despite deadly clashes.

&gt; Senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles called on Venezuelans to continue defying the deeply unpopular Maduro with new protests against the election and the &amp;quot;Massacre&amp;quot; he said accompanied it.

&gt; Maduro has decreed a ban on protests during and after the vote, threatening prison terms of up to 10 years.

in all seriousness, I personally was calling those Lakers teams ""stacked"" back in 2009/10 - so it is not revisionist history. That buzzword gets thrown around way too much.

LO was an absolute matchup nightmare for opposing teams that would go on to be a 6MOTY award winner not long after that year. Gasol was the A1 sidekick Kobe needed to put him over the top, he was an All-NBA player and a bonafide superstar. 

Bynum was probably the best young center in the league at the time (aside from Apex Dwight Howard) and combined with LO and Gasol gave the Lakers some stupid length that teams just couldn't fuck with at the time. He was oft injured but when healthy he was an X-Factor.

They weren't ""stacked"" by today's superteam (GSW/Heatles) standards, but at the time? They were stacked. The best (or 2nd best, depending on personal opinion) player in the world + All-NBA player + 6MOTY forward + Bynum was a very, very good team. 

Analysts are wrong about many things, I would posit that the back-to-back champion Lakers teams having the worst supporting cast in recent history falls into that ""they were wrong"" category. When the Gasol-for-Gasol swap happened, many many people (myself included) felt that the Grizzlies just gave the Lakers at least one championship ring - and were right. ",nba

We can see an example of this with Anonymous, the organization works off of the willingness of individuals, not from the orders of a hierarchy. This is closer to a true democracy as defined by the ideal. It encourages happiness, which I believe is the goal of life.

&gt; Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

&gt; The five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

&gt; The band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

&gt; Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.

&gt; Directly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

&gt; In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

&gt; By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

&gt; In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

&gt; The band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film ""Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)"", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, ""Zenzenzense"", was a #1 hit in Japan.

7690,"I go in ready this time. I have three wigs placed atop my head, all superglued on. My pussy is taped shut. Lorde is not making me a hoe today, I chant. I am a good Christian who's pussy is always moist but never sloppy. There is only one Lord and this one can't have me.

So I start the album. Green Light starts and everything is fine. I enjoy the music but am always careful. Lorde sets in the corner of my room, sulking. I smirk. I just bought this wig and this bitch isn't getting it.

I make it through Homade Dynamite. I make it through The Louvre. I even survive Hard Feelings. My pussy aches but the tape saves my virtue.

And then Melodrama starts. I know this is going to be rough. Lorde, still in the corner, is no longer sulking. She has a look in her eyes. Her wig snatching hand starts to twitch along to the beat my pussy is popping to. I know it will take all of my strength to save myself and remain pure.

But the beat kicks in and I'm simply to weak. I reach down and rip the tape off of my pussy, freeing it and allowing it pop as it was always meant to. The album continues on and, exposed for the Lorde slut I really am, I begin twerking, even though that trend died in 2015. ""Why are you doing this?"" I sob, tears pouring down my cheeks.
""Oh, don't be so,"" she whispers, leaning in so close that, even through all the pussy poppery, I can feel her breath on my ear, ""melodramatic.""

She rips all three of my wigs off in one snatch and then takes out a briefcase. She reaches inside and reveals a small perfume bottle. It's only now, distracted as I was with all the twerking and pussy popping, that I notice there is a camera filming me and Lorde. We're in a perfume commercial.

Lorde hikes my leg up and sticks the bottle inside of me. She then pulls it out and puts a label on it. ""Essence of /u/wonderbitch26's Pussy Poppery.""

""No, please,"" I beg. ""Don't expose me like this. Think of my mother.""

But Lorde has no pity. She just poses for the camera, showcasing my pussy essence for the world to see. She sticks my wigs and pussy poppery in her briefcase where I catch a glimpse of similar wigs and vials. I'm not her first victim. Lorde leaves me there, pussy still popping to the rest of her incredible album, where I will remain for the rest of my hoe ass life.

I agree 100% with Jon about not taking the castles away. Sansa isn't perfect. But the OTT demonization of her and refusal to give her credit for anything gets tedious.

&gt; Hideki Naganuma is a Japanese music composer who primarily does work for video game soundtracks. His music is usually defined as 'Composed in the J-Pop genre' and this implicitly requires mixing Japanese techno, funk, soul, and hip-hop elements to create a very unique and vivid sound. He is most famous for his work on the soundtrack of the Sega Dreamcast's Jet Set Radio and its Xbox sequel, Jet Set Radio Future. Hideki Naganuma uses not only samples from the genres listed above - in the song ""Grace And Glory"" from the Jet Set Radio games he uses an opera sample. The official Jet Set Radio soundtrack, as well as the official Jet Set Radio Future soundtrack, includes all of his songs and several others.  Working alongside the same companies that created Jet Set Radio Future he contributed the entire soundtrack to SEGA's arcade skateboarding game, Ollie King. After a few years with his work absent from SEGA games, he finally returned in the SEGA production Sonic Rush for the Nintendo DS. A year later, he made a remix of Captain Straydum's ""Fuusen Gum"" for the anime Gintama. That same year, he composed the music for Air Gear under the alias of skankfunk. He would compose under this alias for most of his later works.  Read more on Last.fm.

1. Can you switch gold between servers/factions at all?
2. When people consider dead realms, roughly how low is the pop? I have a lock on a 100k pop faction and a hunter on a 200k pop faction - is this considered low?
3. Would legion pathfinder work for chars on other realms?
4. Anecdotally, would you remake the alts on my main server or just level them on the alternate servers?

7808,"Quebec doesn't hate the rest of Canada.

And if you think Quebec's culture isn't different from the rest of the country you clearly didn't spend much time here.

I'm an Ontarian living in Quebec, and one of the things I've come to realize is that part of the Quebecois identity is an enormous cultural inertia. They don't want to be forced to become like the rest of the provinces, and want to keep to themselves and have people respect their culture and political stance while participating as they see fit in Confederation.  They also have tighter control over immigration, and much stronger laws regarding the use of their national language, which many people unfairly chalk up to racism (which it is not).

Quebec politics seems more left-leaning than the rest of the country (especially now), so often the opinions of Quebecois are at odds with those of the more Anglo provinces, and this creates tensions.  Quebec has higher taxes, but is also poorer, and due to its large population receives a large kickback in terms of equalization payments (though let's not forget that all that money comes from taxes paid by the provinces in the first place, and would be collected by the Feds regardless of whether it was used to pay provinces; it's just like income tax for individuals, but on a national level).    

There are also some things that it would seem Quebec is self-conscious about.  A classic example is the [rampant corruption and inefficiency in the construction industry](http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/crise-dans-la-construction/201106/26/01-4412751-corruption-et-collusion-plus-frequentes-quon-ne-croyait-dans-la-construction.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_BO2_quebec_canada_178_accueil_POS3).   This issue aside, Quebec tends to be quite sensitive to criticism from other provinces, and often invokes the term ""Quebec bashing"" when attacked (unjustly or not) by the Anglophone media.  Sometimes they're crying wolf, but it's also true that they get a lot of flak from the rest of the country simply for being different and somewhat separate.",canada

That’s quite awful, but it sums up pretty much the way it deshumanizes people.  Of course there are nice people (about anybody is nice if you get to talk induvidually), but if you look to people as a whole, you just cannot see any invitation for dialog.

But at the same time, I also believe that more things should be reviewable, that there should be cameras atop foul poles and managers shouldn't lose their right to challenge just because a call wasn't overturned.

7819,"&gt;Sure she manipulated the Vale lords but there's no indication she was doing the same to Littlefinger.

She did by publicly declaring him as her guardian. Now LF was kind of bound to protect her - he found a way around that, though. 

&gt;Jon's strategy never would have worked on Ramsay anyway, he's too smart for that. It would have proceeded differently as I already told you, the Vale could bypass Jon and go straight for the remainder of the Bolton army. Infantry don't typically do well when they are outnumbered by heavy cavalry, they would be completely enveloped as they were out in the open without any form of terrain advantage.

Then the number of Wildling casualties would've been the same. And the Vale men can't bypass Jon - take a look at the battlefield. 

&gt;What about the people who live on the Umber and Karstark lands?

Keep the 2 lords as hostages to ensure their loyalty. That's the best way to achieve unity. The loyalty of these kids isn't certain - they might appreciate Jon's mercy or they might resent him for killing their fathers. Its a gamble right now - but holding them hostage will keep their men in line. 

&gt;By ""resolving"" the issue Sansa's way you open up the chance for more infighting.

Not if Jon is smart about it. 

&gt;Under normal circumstances sure the Umbers and Karstarks could have been punished more harshly but the long term effects are irrelevant if the Night King isn't stopped.

You have it backwards. Jon's decision is better for the long-term stability. His decision is what is done under normal circumstances. But like I said, Sansa's suggestion opens up too many political opportunities for someone in crisis and that's why Jon should've taken it. 

&gt;As for the threat of Cersei she would have to be a complete and utter idiot to attempt to invade the North during winter.

That she is. Or more specifically, she'd be too arrogant to consider the downside of what she'd think of as a brilliant plan. 

Her most dangerous option would be try and follow Tywin's example - send a small force of 500-1000 men via the coast. Instruct them to burn the villages and the granaries. Hope that either Jon rides out with a small force to deal with them or he marshalls his forces, taking men away from Moat Cailin which would give her an opportunity to invade. 

Jon wouldn't actually have to do much here - Winter will kill these men pretty soon. But they'll burn enough villages and destroy enough granaries for that to become a problem in the bigger war. ",gameofthrones

Metacritc numbers

A video game is not a number and can't be described as one and even if 1000 people do not like a game, unless they do give a reason about what it is about and what is bad about it I will never know if I wouldn't still like it, maybe because of the story or the gameplay loop or for the theme alone. Also everyone knows a game that seemingly everyone likes, but that they hate or just can't understand what it is about that others find about it.

Also if I do not know anything about the person who judges the game, a games critic is also useless. I need to understand what someone likes and dislikes in games, if someone is consistent in their judging and if someone is unbiased by everything related to the people making/selling the game.

A number can make a little bit of a sense for one specific game critic/someone who gives first game impressions, if they have their consistent transparent way to make these numbers, but adding all these numbers that were made on complete different rules and mean different things is as stupid as stupid gets.

8000,"About a decade ago all our streetlights (in the Netherlands) were orange as well. They are called sodium lamps, use significantly less power than normal lamps for the same output, and have actually been around for almost a hundred years now.

There has been a white variant of this lamp as well for about 30 years now, but it is less efficient and more expensive. While they are not exactly uncommon -you see them a lot on industrial complexes- they aren't generally used to light public streets.

Most of the white/blue lights you see today are probably relatively new and LED-based. Even more efficient and cheaper than the orange sodium lamps. I would think it probable that _new_ streetlights in the UK will soon be of the same variety.

I liked the old orange look, but the LED lights allow you to see better, for some reason reduce nightly crime rates, and are _relatively_ less light polluting. Most people forget the _relatively_ part... LED lights are better directional (less light going into the surrounding area and sky), but they are also significantly brighter (and thus more light goes into the surrounding area and sky due to more reflection). Additionally, light from the sodium lamps is very frequency specific and fairly easily filtered out of the night sky (unlike the broad-spectrum LED lights used). Seeing as Eindhoven is pretty much dead smack in the middle of one of the worst light-polluted areas in the _entire world_, that was helpful for us stargazers. But alas, it is no more.

I ran into a satellite image brightness comparison between now (with LED lights) and a decade ago (with sodium lamps), and the newer image was significantly brighter, as I suspected. No link handy, but if you care it's probably Google-able.

Either its a group of people or its one person who own's multiple channels and uses 1 editor to make all the videos. The videos are always just stream clips smashed together with no editing apart from maybe a Watermark that belongs to the channel and not the streamer. 

Most of the channels provide links to the streams of each person used in the video but I do agree these channels are benefiting off of literaly doing nothing but downloading a pre-rendered video (stream clip) and putting it into a video editing software with no editing. Add a little crappy watermark and a end screen with Project: Fiora footage (again not there property) and then adding a few links to previous videos on that channel.

Who ever owns these channels has only one interest and that is to make as much money for the least ammount of effort.

Streamers should flag these channels for stealing content and money. (the money the channels make could be made on the actual stream by watching adds or people liking said stream and donating).

The 10:1 rule says that, basically, for every 1 promotional submission you submit to the subreddit, you should have 10 non-promotional submissions. These submissions can be either posts or comments. Promotion can be self promotion or the promotion of others.

As a general rule, take promotional content to include:

- Links to community websites (self or non-self involving)

- Links (or references) to streams or YouTube channels (again, self or non-self involving)

- Links to written articles (self or non-self involving)

- Links to artwork (I think you get the point by now)

- Feedback on content (and comments contain in such threads)

- Links to your own websites/emails/contact addresses

If what you're submitting doesn't fall under any of those categories, it doesn't count as promotional content. You can submit as much non-promotional content as you want!

As a general warning, the first post on a new account should not be promotional.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/189bcc7300374851abdcfc6600e0d9cb.png)  

&gt; The Damned are a punk rock group originally from Croydon, England, a suburb of London, who were formed in 1976. Despite being one of the definitive early punk bands they were also one of the most ambitious; with their later albums moving away from the breakneck garage sound of their debut and taking in elements from goth and psychedelia to prog and metal.

&gt; They are notable for being the first of the British punk bands to release a single, put out an album, and tour the United States. Their debut album, Damned Damned Damned, was released six months before The Sex Pistols' debut, Never Mind The Bollocks.

&gt; The Damned have dissolved and reformed many times, with singer Dave Vanian remaining the sole constant. They have incorporated many styles in their music, most notably garage rock, psychedelic music, the British theatrical rock of Screaming Lord Sutch and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and New Romantic. 

&gt; In addition to serving as inspiration for many of the young bands who created hardcore punk in the US, The Damned are also generally regarded as one of the founders of goth music.

&gt; Original members Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns), and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) were all members of the semi-legendary Masters of the Backside which included future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.

&gt; Original guitarist Brian James (Brian Robertson) was a member of the early punk band London SS, a unit that never played live, but whose members later found fame in bands including The Clash and Generation X. Rat Scabies was also tried as the drummer for London SS, but was rejected.

&gt; Maintaining the goth connection, between 1996 and 2004 the bass guitarist of the Damned was one-time the Sisters of Mercy / the Sisterhood / Gun Club member Patricia Morrison. Morrison married Dave Vanian in 1996 but left the band after the birth of their daughter Emily. She originally joined the band after bassist Paul Grey was injured during a concert.

8118,"Aiming is overrated because even if you are good at putting your crosshair on the right part of the body, it doesn´t matter if you don´t hit your shot. And this is the part you can just grind out ad practice in workshops. The problem is that people MOVE to much in the moment of hitting the trigger. You need to learn counter strafing with fast stop. 

For example I found a Deagle workshop map with pretty open spaces and sat for a couple of hours just focusing on moving for example right and then just hitting left really fast to stop before pulling the trigger. I started to hit some insane Deagle headshots even on long rage, I was just laughing with love haha. That really made it click for me even if I have played CS for a long time. Be patience and don´t stress the shots. If the body model is still you will hit where the crosshair is placed. If you move while shooting it´s more luck and you get frustrated and tilted that you don´t get a frag. It´s really hard to get used to counter strafing, but when you master it including holding angels and peeking you will become a BEAST. Better hitting the shots then slamming the mousebutton and pray. And yes, you can still be very active in moving, but you just have to master the ""move and stop"" technics and practice offline alot at first. 
Trust me, you will be amazed how easy it can be to for example hit 3-4 one Deags. Another challenging practice mode you can try is finding a smaller workshop map for Awp where you can also use Deagle and try to kill the Awpers witch only Deag. Very good practice and you really have to use all your skills in moving/peeking and having patience. The reason I use Deagle as an example so much is that you get great feedback fast. If you do it right you headshot all the time. Just have fun and practice :)",GlobalOffensive

8178,"&gt;because you weren't a US citizen you needed to apply for residency, and earn that entitlement. But if you were a US citizen, you wouldn't have needed to do anything - you'd already be entitled to residency.

I'd have had to either be born in the United States or applied for US Citizenship before I could claim entitlements as a citizen, rather than applying for a visa. So no, it's not the case that I would get such an entitlement without doing anything, short of being born there.

&gt;You know what's unjust? Citizens of convenience using Canadian resources without ever having lived in Canada before.

Citizens of convenience don't live in Canada, so they're not getting entitlements from Canada if they don't live there. We've been over that. So besides protection of their basic human rights, they're not getting medicare, or welfare, or anything but the basic human rights protections that Canadian citizenship affords.

&gt;Do you suppose that any and all foreigners are entitled to citizenship? No? Then why should it be any different because they were born here?

I do in fact share Canada's own position on this matter: that anyone is entitled to obtain Canadian citizenship. In fact, pretty much the only way you aren't eligible for Canadian citizenship is [if you're guilty of a crime or had your citizenship revoked](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizenship/situations.asp).

&gt;Who said anything about being stateless?

*I* mentioned it. Now could you please stop using that pedantic turn of phrase?

&gt; A child born to Chinese birth tourists in Canada is still a Chinese citizen. They're not stateless.

8362,"&gt; And unnamed sources stop being evidence when they are used in 100% of the stories for an entire fucking year.

Do you expect people to pretend to be oblivious?  

Sure the initial reports about Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador when Obama levied sanctions relied on unnamed sources, but we've since had that claim fully confirmed.  And sure the sources for the original reports that sanctions were discussed was unnamed, but that too was later confirmed.  And sure the initial reports that Sally Yates had specifically warned the White House over what had really gone on in the Flynn phone call was unnamed but we've since had confirmation of that too.  

And this has happened time and again.  Unnamed sources have been the basis of story after story that were subsequently confirmed.  Meanwhile those same stories before they were confirmed were in nearly every case denied by the people concerned.  

Is that the kind of thing you're talking about when you say ""when they are used in 100% of the stories for an entire fucking year""?  

It's somewhat odd that you pay so much attention to sources being unnamed in initial reports but somehow have over looked that many of those reports have since been confirmed and it's odd you find unnamed sources not known to be liars less credible than the people who have been caught lying about these issues again and again and again.  Because after all, many of these reports have since been confirmed as true and most of them were initially denied in the interim (between first reporting and the claims being confirmed true).

And what do you mean by year?  Which reports from a year ago are you talking about?",conspiracy

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

8376,"I mean Jeter had years just as good as Nomar's, they just happened to be spread out over the course of his career instead of in a four year streak. 7.4, 6.6, 6.2, 6.1 is almost right at Nomar's best four years. Yes, Nomar was a better player, and would have had a better career if he didn't get hurt, but to say that Jeter never put up numbers close to Nomar's peak just isn't true. He did, he had years just as good as Nomar had, and them not being in a row doesn't change that.

As for Garciaparra being better defensively, having more power, and being a better contact hitter, you're right, but none of those things are significantly different. He had a little more power, had some years with insane contact, and was a better defender. That being said, Jeter had better plate discipline. The truth is, if you take each player's best offensive season, they're valuable in slightly different ways, but they give pretty much identical offensive value. Nomar was better defensively, but in the early years of Jeter's career, he was a pretty good defender, so it's not like there was some huge discrepancy.",baseball

Not if they are not jailed, their boats not confiscated, their court cases dragged out, etc. That's why it's more reasonable to stop them from even reaching the migrants, you circumvent all the problems.

&gt;You have to have gotten a special kind of education in order to think that this is a complex problem.

Don't worry, you just have to have any kind of education at all in order to see the problems. But again, if I am wrong, it shouldn't be difficult to convince plenty of people with common sense.

&gt;Now, another problem that we haven't even gotten to is that the EU has completely fucked the incentives. Italy doesn't care nearly as much that many migrants are arriving because most of them travel to the north anyway. This is a result of open border policy. If the migrants had to stay in Italy as per the first country doctrine, they would close their sea border real quick.

So now you want to end Schengen. Is Schengen an ""open borders policy"" for you? I would disagree, at least from the EU's perspective, as it is an internal border.

Of course, I agree with you that this is an institutional problem. Absolutely. Which was my initial point all along, i.e. we have an institutional-political problem with the wrong incentives.

8519,"Valve implemented the new spray pattern on the Negev as a 'suppressing fire' type weapon, something which counter strike hasn't had before. People aren't using it because that style of weapon doesn't match the current play style of the game. 

It doesn't fit the pistol 'adadad' or the SMG 'run n gun' or the lurker, etc etc etc. 
Usually the new play styles are derived from the pro scene downwards ('top down') but in this case with the Negev banned at the top, we aren't seeing a new play style develop in the lower levels. 

For example, a suitable use of suppressing fire would be on CT side cache mid, laying out unlimited bullets from white box in to a smoked mid warehouse so the T's can't push while 3 T's push b and one self boosts mid. Another strategy for suppressing fire could be on T side, where the Negev clears angles by crouch walking, forcing the CT's out of some positions and making them play safer angles, then the rest of the team using utilities on those angles to force them in to the open. 

I'm not saying either of the above would be great, or even slightly good at all - but I would love to see the Negev opened up at the top level (allowed for pro's) to see what 'new meta' they can come up with. If they can't find a valid use for suppressing fire, then valve need to go back to the drawing board... And if they can, let's enjoy! Reward to the forward thinkers! 

PS. Remember, prime is still beta, sprays were going to be the worst thing in the game, vac is being updated to an AI type system, etc etc etc - Valve does move, and does watch the community. They just take a long time to evaluate a pattern before making sharp adjustments. ",GlobalOffensive

That's an arbitrary distinction.  They're are just kids when you're looking back from 55 years old.  Less so when you're 25.

The line is quite arbitrary, but I suspect a LOT fewer people would have sympathy for a nineteen year old in a similar situation for no good reason beyond not being able to feel as much sympathy for a nineteen year old.

It's clear that throwing is a big problem, especially this season, and something needs to change to make it far more heavily disincentivised.

As I see it, you can't rely on player reports alone to punish people, otherwise any off-meta picks would result in severe consequences for someone who might legitimately be contributing to the team - so any changes have to incorporate some level of 'behind the scenes' analysis.

Based on the data that Blizzard collects (visible on the PlayOverwatch site and on third-party stat trackers), it should be possible to calculate if a player's score per minute is far below expectations for the current combination of hero, map, and Competitive tier. If that falls below a specified threshold - like if they deal no damage or gain zero / very low score per minute, yet have a very high number of deaths from jumping off the map or deliberately feeding the enemy team - then the account should be flagged and matched against any reports from that game accusing them of throwing. If there's a correlation across a number of games, that account should either be issued with a temporary Competitive ban, or placed into a low-priority matchmaking queue alongside people with a high proportion of mid-game disconnects.

The only way out of that queue should be to complete a certain number of games (perhaps backfilling for comp games where one or more players have dropped out) and for the duration of being in that division, the player would gain no XP, CP, or SR.

Of course, this kind of thing might be impossible to implement due to back-end code - hence my first pint about a lack of communication...",Overwatch

Yes. Since they have a very different history than Canada, a different immigration strategy, and a very different ethnic make up of their country.

2) Are Canadians better than Americans when it comes to ethnicity?

Those aren't ethnicities, they're nationalities. Both countries are made up of many different ethnicities.

3) I'd argue that we aren't worried about unconscious bias only blatant discrimination. We have the Employment equity act passed in 1984. We all have equal rights.

Question for you, are white people the only group that has an unconscious bias against other groups? Should asian students who perform the highest in Canada in post secondary education be checking their privilege? 

4) People with foreign names struggle to find work in any country, language barriers and all that. Try the same study with very eastern european names, and if the results are different, then hey, I guess there is white privilege. If they aren't, we must be honest and admit you can both be foreign and white. That's why it's dumb to base things off of skin colour.

""For resumés with foreign names and education, call backs nearly doubled when the applicant had held one previous job in Canada.""

Also mentioned that they didn't care if the last name was asian or anything else, if the first name was a standard Canadian name the odds were very similar. 

5) Lots of skilled immigrants education is not considered certified in Canada, and there is a language barrier. I speak French. Not very well, but I do, can read and write it as well. No way I could do my job at the same level in France. Crazy to think I could. Employers are about their bottom line.

6) Immigration isn't from one place, and a lot of opposition to it actually has to do with our employment in Canada and our current housing market. I would believe there's something racist with this if the article was about stopping immigration from Asia, or the Middle East, or Africa, and allowing European immigration. It isn't. It's about stopping immigration. You can be anti-immigration and not racist.

First of all, Nietzsche is one of the most well known Western Philosphers in recent history. Nearly all rudimentary brush strokes courses of Western Philosophy talk about Nietzsche. I'm willing to bet this guy knows about him, as do most read individuals.

Secondly, you mentioned the fountainhead so I assume you know Rand. So you should also know that Snyder has an eternal hard on for the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Objectivism and Nihilism share similarities, but Objectivism is more concerned with shedding the mediocre persons of society to become better, vs Nihilism shedding the constraining ideas of society (mostly like you said Christian morality). In the movies Superman mostly debates himself over shedding the people and forgetting them, rather than shedding the constraining higher morals.  This distinction is subtle but important, because no one in either film has much in the way of Christian or High minded morals. Instead they have Objectivism morals, where everything is concerned about people and great people and what to do with great people and how people just don't understand great people (even though his dads both say this btw, they also contradict it in other statements)

While Nietzschen Nihilism and Randian Objectivism have similarities, I like to think Objectivism is the next step. Not only is man not beholden to God, but man is not even beholden to man. Personally I think all of this is half baked in the movies and at the very base level in Philosophy and while worth talking about to introduce some of these ideas, really doesn't flesh them out.",movies

I think there are rights that we as human being have simply by the fact that we are autonomous rational individual, and that these rights exists as a moral obligation for people to respect regardless of the particular situation of country, ethnicity, race, religion, government, etc. 

If I was in North Korea, I would not the right to criticize the North Korean government. The fact that this ""right"" is not respected by the North Korean government doesn't mean that the right doesn't exist as a moral obligation. It ought to be the case that North Korea respects the rights of its citizens to criticize their government. Wherein NK fails to do this, it is abridging and violating the people's right.

This violation can only make sense if the right to criticize the government is independent of whether the state has made allowance for such rights or not. In other words, it can only make sense if the right was universal, applicable to all human beings, regardless of whether the right was respected by the government or not.

If we accepted your argument, then you would say North Korean did not have any moral claim to this right. I think that is absurd, and hence clearly false. ",europe

Silica: Silicon Dioxide*. Obsidian is glass made of silica and oxygen, and other heavier metals found in 'mafic' (magnesium/ferric [iron containing]) rocks, such as basalt.  The volcanic glass is cooled very quickly, which mean no time for crystal formation at all, even the basalt spewed out of volcano cools ""slowly"" enough that small crystals form.  The crystals serve to muddy the glassy appearance, and also bind the rock together more thoroughly, which is why lava flow (aa) rocks are sharp, but hard, and sound glassy when broken.  Volcanic glass, much like manufactured glass, is easily broken and simultaneously can have extremely sharp edges.

They run the butane torch on the bowl until it's red hot then they scoop a big bit on the nail and sizzle it down.

To me dabs have always been WAY harsher. I am coughing for like 15 minutes and my eyes water. My lungs usually hurt for a day or two after. Not to mention all the butane and often hexane used in making shatter that people love. But CO2 extraction is probably way more common now. I also have rarely done my own dabs. It's usually when I am over at one of my ""stoner 4 lyfe"" friend's house and they offer and I once in a while say sure.

For me dabs have been even harsher than a blunt or a joint, which I really only do at concerts now. I have gotten to become an expert at cornering flower in pipe on the other hand so that I almost never get ash at all. I have greens always in the second to last hit and often in the last one.

These same people will then turn around and swear up and down that MGM just ain't the same! Common themes include:


* It's just a bit of skin! (Yeah, one of the most densely innervated pieces of skin found in humans, with multiple functions)
* I'm cut and I love my dick! (Nobody's asking you to hate it, doesn't mean we should be doing it to others)
* FGM is SO much worse, why do men always derail the conversation?! (We've covered that it isn't always worse which isn't the damn point, what happened to ""my body my choice""? Oh and maybe we bring it up because FGM is illegal and mainstream articles still talk about it practically weekly due to a handful of cases and nobody fucking cares about the thousands of boys subjected to MGM)
* Uncut looks weird, or ""we want him to look like his daddy!"" (Usually Americans that say these things, and any other kind of cosmetic surgery on infants or children would have people up in arms. Also, the same arguments are used by proponents of FGM)
* There are medical benefits! (Alleged by highly flawed and biased studies which are extremely minor in scope and not a reason to perform it) 
* It's cleaner! (Yeah because retracting your foreskin as an adult for 3 seconds to give it a scrub is SO difficult. Let's chop off baby's ears too since they might not clean behind them!)

There is no logically tenable position other than ""I don't care about boys' and men's bodily autonomy"" to be against FGM but indifferent or approving of MGM.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Peruzzi

Mario Peruzzi (September 8, 1875 – December 10, 1955) was an Italian-born American businessman and manufacturer. He was the co-founder and president of the Planters Peanut Company.

Peruzzi was a director of the Miners National Bank of Wilkes-Barre for twenty years prior to his resignation from the board in 1949. Peruzzi was also president of Planters Edible Oil Company and National Peanut Corporation during this time. He was also on the board of Mercy Hospital in Wilkes-Barre for a few years. He was also associated with the Wilkes-Barre-Wyoming Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Italo-American Citizens club and various local Rotary clubs.[2]

Peruzzi became president of Planters Nut and Chocolate Company upon the death of Obici in 1947. At this time the company had 2,000 employees and sold $40,000,000 worth a year. The company grew to over 3,000 employees in the 1950s. Peruzzi continued to be its president until his death on December 10, 1955.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruzzi

The Peruzzi were bankers of Florence, among the leading families of the city in the 14th century, before the rise to prominence of the Medici. Their modest antecedents stretched back to the mid 11th century, according to the family's genealogist Luigi Passerini, but a restructuring of the Peruzzii company in 1300, with an infusion of outside capital, marked the start of a quarter-century of prosperity that brought the family consortium to the forefront of Florentine affairs.

The size of the bank should not be understated: by the 1330s, the Peruzzi bank was the second largest in Europe, with fifteen branches from the Middle East to London, all capitalized to the sum of more than 100,000 gold florins and manned by approximately 100 factors.[1]",conspiracy

9189,"&gt; What would be undemocratic about it? It wouldn't be a good system with checks and balances, it would be a pure democracy.

A link for you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy

&gt; According to political scientist Larry Diamond, democracy consists of four key elements: **(a) A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections;** (b) The active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; (c) Protection of the human rights of all citizens, and (d) A rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.

**Without proper rights you cannot even have free and fair elections (requirement a)**, and if some groups can arbitrarily decide that parts of the people suddenly is not part of the people anymore then that is clearly anti-democratic as well, because requirement b would not be fulfilled anymore. Notice also that a system allows for total arbitrariness on the part of the ruling classes if requirement d is not fulfilled, and requirement d entails that citizens have more rights than just the right to vote (e.g. they also have to have the right to equal treatment by the legal system).

&gt; Yes you can. 

+

&gt; Wrong.

No you cannot. Vast parts of the people, including female citizens (see below) were not allowed to vote. That is not a democracy in any modern sense. Of course you can argue ""some very specific people still had the right to vote"", but that would be like calling a country in which only communists are allowed to vote a democracy.

http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_women_and_family?page=all#section_4

&gt; **Second, the Periclean law formally recognized Athenian-born women as citizens in their own right**, and sanctioned their role in the continuation of the citizen body. Women until then were participants of the polis only in the sphere of religion, where they could hold priestly offices, and perform ceremonial duties in public gatherings. After the Periclean citizenship law Athenian women are recognized as participants in the state, even if not fully, and this comes with certain obligations.

They later had citizen status and yet they were not allowed to vote. Before that they were not even seen as citizens, which is also anti-democratic (see requirement b above).

http://www.ancientgreece.co.uk/athens/home_set.html

&gt; Male citizens in Athens could vote on all the decisions that affected the city and serve on juries. However, democracy was not open to everyone. Citizen women and children were not allowed to vote. Slaves and foreigners living in Athens (known as metics) were banned from participating in government.

9213,"**Free Agency- Acquisitions (Offense)**

Position | Player | Old Team
--- | --- | ---
FB | Tommy Bohanon |
WR | Larry Pinkard |
TE | Mychal Rivera | Oakland Raiders
OL | Branden Albert* | Miami Dolphins
OL | Earl Watford | Arizona Cardinals
OL | Demetrius Rhaney | Los Angeles Rams

**Tommy Bohanon:** To emphasize the fact that the Jaguars were bringing back the fullback, they signed Tommy Bohanon in free agency, who was the starting fullback on the Jets from 2013-15. This was before the team drafted Marquez Williams in the seventh round, so Bohanon was a signing just in case they couldn’t get their guy in the draft at this position. On one hand, Bohanon was not on a team last year, so his odds of making the roster don’t look that good when you think of it that way (especially since there’s a seventh round pick on the roster that’s going to be the likely starter). On the other hand, the only reason he wasn’t on the Jets last year was because the Jets did not carry a fullback. It’s not like he lost the starting job; they just took the job away. In 2015, he was the starting fullback when Chris Ivory led the AFC in rushing, so Bohanon definitely had a part in his success. I don’t think he ends up making the roster, but it won’t be because of poor play; it’ll be because you’re only carrying one fullback, and Williams has to be the favorite at this point.

**Larry Pinkard:** Of all the receivers that are currently on the 90-man roster (and there are 12 of them), the one with the least chance of actually getting signed and making it onto the 53-man roster has to be Larry Pinkard. He wasn’t on any team last year, and hopped on and off Green Bay’s practice squad in 2015 before signing with Oakland that same season. The thing about Pinkard is that, judging from the box scores, he’s a big play receiver. Of the catches he had in the preseason back in 2015 when he was on Green Bay’s roster, his worst catch in terms of yardage was 8 yards. A lot of his catches go for big gains, upwards of 30 yards, including [this 77-yard touchdown pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6ZLUKE6ulo) in week 4 of the 2015 preseason against the Saints “defense.” However, judging from the box scores, he seems like an inconsistent receiver; in the final 2 preseason games with the Packers, he only caught 3 of the 9 passes thrown his way. Considering the fact that Green Bay’s backup quarterback that was throwing the passes is actually a quarterback (Brett Hundley) and not some guy that’s just making up the numbers, that’s a bit concerning. Pinkard might be good for a big play in the fourth quarter of the preseason here and there, but I doubt he’s anything more than that.

**Mychal Rivera:** With Julius Thomas now on the Miami Dolphins, the Jaguars desperately needed a new starting tight end. They can't ride into the season with Marcedes Lewis, who is entering his 12th year and is on his last legs at this point, as the top guy. The Jaguars found the answer to this problem by signing tight end Mychal Rivera in free agency to a 2-year deal. Is he going to be the guy that solves the void at tight end? Probably not. He's 6'3"", so he's not exactly a true tight end in terms of his frame; he's built a lot like Clay Harbor, but better. However, he can be used in the passing game, as he had 58 receptions back in 2014. The two things on his side are his ability to stay healthy and his ability to catch the ball (which seems like the opposite of Julius Thomas). He caught 72% of passes thrown his way last season, and he's played 61 out of a possible 64 games in 4 seasons. While he's probably not the long-term answer at tight end, and might not even be a real #1 tight end, he's better than anything else the Jags could've brought out for 2017.

**Branden Albert:** I’m putting Albert here because I couldn’t put him anywhere else, since he was technically acquired in a trade where the Jaguars gave up their seventh round selection in the 2018 NFL Draft. The obvious pro with Albert is that when he’s healthy, he’s really good. In 2015, he made the Pro Bowl with the Miami Dolphins, and he did the same in 2013 with the Kansas City Chiefs. There’s no denying that Albert can play in this league. However, you don’t get a player by giving up a seventh round pick if they don’t come with some problems as well. The two obvious problems with Albert are his age and his injury history. Even though Albert is entering his 10th year in the NFL, he’s going to be 33 years old by the end of the season. Bleacher Report had an article [about the prime age of an offensive lineman](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1683775-when-does-age-catch-up-to-nfl-players), and what they concluded was that offensive linemen typically start declining around year 11 or 12. But seeing as Albert was a 24-year old rookie (and most rookies are around the age of 22), he’s technically entering that year 12 range (since a rookie who is 33 years old that enters the league as a 22-year old player will be hitting year 12 by the time they are 33). The other obvious concern is his injury history. I’ll bring this stat up a lot at various points in this write-up, but in 9 seasons, he’s only started a full season once, and that was in 2011, when there was practically no offseason. Every year that he’s gone through a full offseason, he didn’t start the entire season. He’s only started more than 12 games once in the last 5 years, and that was in 2015, when he started 14 games. Out of 80 possible starts in the last 5 years, Albert has started just 58 games, meaning that he’s missed 22 starts (about a season and a half worth of starts). Obviously, that’s not good. It’s likely that Albert is nothing more than a very good stopgap before Cam Robinson takes over the left tackle spot.

**Earl Watford:** The Jaguars signed Watford for what should be nothing more than offensive line depth on the interior (since left guard was a revolving door last season, with guys underperforming and getting hurt left and right). In terms of depth, he’s not a bad guy to have; he’s played multiple positions on the line with the Cardinals (guard and tackle), and he started 11 games for the Cardinals last year. I think [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5yt9ak/former_cardinals_g_earl_watford_will_sign_with/desqdtc/?st=j4swfkle&amp;sh=3c9990f4) by /u/SenorSpicyCat when the move was announced pretty much sums up what Watford can do. Good depth, especially in run situations. He should make the roster, and might even win a starting job when all is said and done.

**Demetrius Rhaney:** The Rams released this man on June 20, and the Jaguars claimed him on June 21, so he’s only been on the roster for a few weeks now. The former seventh round pick out of Tennessee State was on the Rams for three years, and since he is entering his fourth year, he does not have practice squad eligibility. If he’s going to play for the Jaguars this year, he’ll have to find some way to climb up the depth chart and make the 53-man roster. Rhaney played all 32 games over the past 2 seasons, and even got a start in 2015. [His background story is pretty interesting](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/missing-high-school-transcript-nearly-derailed-shot-at-college-and-nfl-for-offensive-lineman-demetrius-rhaney-183421633-nfl.html), and how different his life almost was due to a missing high school transcript. I’m guessing he’s not that good and was just playing because nobody else on that offensive line could; unlike the reaction when Watford signed with the Jaguars, [everyone on the Rams subreddit seemed happy that he was gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesRams/comments/6ifeg0/rams_have_released_centerguard_demetrius_rhaney/?st=j4swkr8k&amp;sh=bd741816). Guessing he won’t be anything more than a camp body in what seems to be a crowded interior line competition.

*""The Aboriginal population of Canada during the late 15th century is estimated to have been between 200,000[10] and two million,[11] with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.[12] Repeated outbreaks of Old World infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), were the main cause of depopulation. This combined with other factors such as dispossession from European/Canadian settlements and numerous violent conflicts resulted in a forty- to eighty-percent aboriginal population decrease after contact.[10] For example, during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron), who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in what became Canada. They were reduced to fewer than 10,000 people""*

Misfits went to semis only because they played Splyce in the first round. Once top 4 steps up, these 2 will be far away again. 

In NA you have TSM, C9, DIG and Immortals who could all take 1st place, CLG who will probably remain strong despite kicking Dardoch, and Envy who can always suprise, thanks to a very solid bot lane, decent mid lane and Lira. All these 3 teams can end up in top 3. No team is a free win, Liquid improved, P1 despite slumping massively are still dangerous, Echo Fox and FlyQuest can always suprise, or put up a fight at the very least. 

I'm pretty sure that Misfits and Splyce would end up in the bottom 3 of NALCS, while the bottom tier NA teams should find themselves a place in playoffs in EU. I mean, P1 were 9th in league when they came to RR and they ended up 4:2, with their 2nd game vs FNC being thrown heavily. The money in NA did its job and while the top teams are still not ready to match Koreans, the league itself is finally looking strong. Every team has big names that are capable of winning games on their own from time to time. Overall, NALCS's strength is now much closer to LPL than to EULCS, thanks to how big the gap between mid and bottom tier teams is. ",leagueoflegends

As to topics, it's generally things that go against progressive-liberal ideas, that he seems to sometimes react negatively to.  

Now, some of this might be him sort of empathizing with his audience.  Like, he thinks (or knows) that most of his audience probably feels the same way he does, so he deems it OK to let his feelings come out a little bit when he's talking about a certain subject.  In any event, I really don't think it's right, and I'm also pretty sure this kind of thing was strongly discouraged in the past.  I saw Wendy Mesley mention this not too long ago in a live Q&amp;A thing.

These aren't him reading the news, off a prompter, so it's different, but the following stuff I think really let the public knows where he stands:

His 'One-on-One' interview with Tony Blair.  I think Mansbridge went in thinking he and Tony were going to just shit on Trump for 30 minutes, but Blair threw him for a real loop.  

The U.S. election night panel.  Ashleigh Banfield was right down the middle.  David Frum gave his intelligent, but quite obviously (and admittedly) biased take.  Meanwhile, Danielle Moodie-Mills, whoever she is, gave us the SJW, 'oppressed' Black person, unqualified-blogger perspective for three hours - saying all kinds of crazy shit, and Peter only once, *almost* challenged her on something.  

The most recent Ann Coulter interview.  Coulter can be abrasive, so it's not your typical interview, anytime, but Mansbridge again, let us all know again what he thinks.  The subject was mostly immigration.  Mansbridge got a tad bristly and perturbed at Ann's responses.  

To be a robot is unreasonable.  So to counteract conveying too much of yourself, you take the other side from time to time, or play devils advocate if that'd be beneficial to the audience.

You rate atleti over Juve despite the fact that the latter has the same record and reached the final just this season, and you rate PSG even lower despite the fact that they are, in fact, a particularly dangerous team. 

 Before transfers, atleti is on the top 10 along with all the other teams I mentioned. After the transfer window, they'll still be in the top 10 despite having their chances fluctuate ever so slightly. At the end of the day, it's just a cup competition where everyone has roughly the same shot at the thing, and Atletico is one of the only teams in its class that simply hasn't won it before.

Cersei's children had claims to the Iron Throne, but Cersei herself has none. Cersei was queen mother and a queen mother can potentially rule as queen regent on behalf of her children until the heir comes of age, but the queen mother herself has no claim whatsoever. You can't marry into the royal family; that's why Cersei is still a Lannister and didn't become Cersei Baratheon the way Catelyn Tully became Catelyn Stark.",gameofthrones

9578,"You and so many other people making comments don't understand the difference between a villain and an antagonist. 

A villain is a bad person who does bad things. 

An antagonist is a person who opposes the protagonist. 

Since Cersei is technically the protagonist in King's Landing during Seasons 5 and 6, since we're mainly following her story, she's classified as a villainous protagonist due to her wicked actions and personality.

The High Sparrow is thus the antagonist, since he's opposing Cersei. However, his interests are of the people, of the greater good. What he's doing is good by purging corruption and making things as the gods will it (which is seen as very good in Westeros). Thus, the High Sparrow is the heroic antagonist to Cersei.

9580,"1. The Reptilians are a race trying to take over the earth and humanity. They love to eat children, but not adults as adults are contaminated with drugs, nicotine, alcohol, and other substances. They can hide their appearance using technology that essentially creates a hologram around them, but sometimes, in the right circumstances, a digital camera can see right through the hologram disguise. Most missing children end up going to the reptilians for dinner.
2. The Illuminati get their instructions from the Reptilians. The I's are huge businessman, very rich, and have several of their own secret societies that control things. The I's rarely see the reptilians, but there are cases of sightings. Usually the Reptilians send a low-level reptilian servant in robes. 

All the rest has to do with various societies controlled by the Illuminati, playing politics on a global scale, and working towards a new world order. Their current plan includes making some type of major catastrophe. The fake global warming was one plan to alarm people to spend time and money on something useless.

Part of this plan is a world catastrophe happens, and aliens come down to ""save us"". But these aliens are not the good guys, as the good guys have a policy of non-interference. The aliens are bad guys who will slowly take away liberties until there are no rights, and no guns, left. The bad aliens will likely have someone who looks like Jesus. The bad aliens will claim they made Jesus (which is false) and might show a film of him being crucified (which is true, they were there).

Ignore what they say, and watch their actions. Their actions will tell all.

The reptilians DO NOT like Trump, because he's actually trying to help, and there is a plan to replace him with a biological automaton if he cannot be controlled. 

[More info on the history of earth here](https://markable.in/file/e40b13b2-665f-11e7-a472-0a41a440e2ed.html) compiled from many sources but mostly from the Pleiadians.

There were a bunch of different non-human races on Earth at various times going back at least 22 million years. But they were not connected to the reptilians. Most were seen as gods, some were nice, some were cruel.
Some built the megaliths that predate the Flood that happened about 10,000BC. 

The Flood of 10,000BC was likely the result of a meteor strike where fragments hit from Minnesota all the way down to South Carolina.

When he was killed she could very easily have gone to live with the rest of the wives but she stepped into the flames and eventually ended up heading her own khalasar. I could go on. I personally think she has managed to do a lot especially given her alienation from most of Westeros and her inexperience. The fact that she made it home the way she did is incredible.

9632,"I think Caldwell is a better coach than he was in Indy. His scheme of using the offense to run out the clock last year was the *only* reason we were able to make the playoffs. We had massive, gaping holes in the roster and he used the best scheme possible for that roster. The scheme didn't always work, and it wasn't the most entertaining football to watch, but it got us farther than a *lot* of people were saying (ESPN was saying 4-12 to 6-10 at best without Calvin Johnson) it would.

That said, his clock management is still horrible and he wanted to keep Lombardi. So he's far from being the perfect coach. But, the man has been to two Super Bowls (not as a HC, but on the coaching staff), so he's been involved with winning organizations before. He also is reportedly very much on the same page with Bob Quinn, so it helps when the HC and GM work well together.

I think there's a ceiling with Caldwell, but I don't really know what that is. We've only had three seasons with him, and only one under our current GM. I don't think at this point the ceiling is much higher than a playoff win. But, Caldwell has also given us a floor. Gym Shorts got us to the playoffs once but every other season he coached us was a bust. Caldwell's gotten us there 2 out of 3 years, and we haven't done worse than a 7-win season (and even then only because of Lombardi's shit offense). He's not afraid to piss off the fans if it gives him a strategic advantage. Like when he pulled Peyton Manning and ruined the Colts' perfect season. The fans hated it, but there is no trophy, no award for having a perfect season in the NFL. There is only the Conference Championships and the Super Bowl. Resting Peyton was the smart call.",nfl

9638,"I think it's pretty clear what my argument was, but in case of confusion, let me restate it: the abilities have cooldowns not only because they are fun and high damage but because they are easier than the main weapons.  Nothing you posted actually countered my argument.  Landing a helix rocket is infinitely easier than landing four consecutive headshots, and landing a FtH on a close opponent is infinitely easier than landing two headshots.  Also your math is off, FtH is capable of a maximum 270 damage.  McCree can't do 270 damage with two headshots, even with a Mercy beam.
Abilities in this game were never meant to be difficult or highly skill -dependent, yet for some reason Hanzo is the one character in the game who should require a degree in mathematics to use correctly?  

&gt;Hanzo's ability is fired at the same rate as his other skills

Your initial post didn't mention anything about the fire rate of these abilities, so you're kind of changing your argument here.  Which is fine, I'm just pointing it out.  

&gt;It's bullshit, but it is the world we live in: period. Adapt until they nerf it.

The damage of scatter is balanced with the low consistent damage potential and difficulty inherent in using his Stormbow.  But even if you are too shortsighted to look at his abilities and balance in context of the character as a whole, I highly doubt they are going to nerf an underpowered hero with a low global kill rate and even lower winrates in competitive.  It would be counter-productive.  

Scatter gets a lot of tears, but in terms of ""statistical data"" Hanzo is a perfectly balanced character as is. 

I'm sure you would be surprised as how often scatter actually one-shots anyone.  Only Blizzard has those stats though.  We can assume though, since scatter has a ten second cooldown, and it's obviously so easy to land every arrow instantly - that Hanzos would average one guaranteed kill every ten seconds.  Yet that doesn't seem to be the case.  In fact, *statistically* speaking, Soldiers on average earn more kills a game from Helix than Hanzo does with Scatter.  Odd.  ",Overwatch

&gt; Starship is an American pop/rock band best known for their hits ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" and ""We Built This City"" that operated from 1985 to 1989, reforming in 1992 although featuring just vocalist Mickey Thomas. In 1984, singer-songwriter Paul Kantner left the San Francisco, California group Jefferson Starship. His former bandmates wanted to continue with that name, but Kantner, as the last founding member of Jefferson Airplane, took legal action over the ""Jefferson"" name. Kantner settled out of court and signed an agreement that neither party would use the names ""Jefferson"" or ""Airplane"" unless all members of Jefferson Airplane, Inc. (made up of Bill Thompson, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, and Jack Casady) agreed.  The band then took the name ""Starship"". Keyboard player David Freiberg, who had been increasingly marginalized, left as well.

&gt; In contrast to Paul Kantner's more experimental and progressive rock direction, Starship moved towards a sleek arena rock direction reminiscent of contemporaries Foreigner and Journey. In 1985, the band, based primarily around dual vocalists Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick, released 'Knee Deep in the Hoopla' and immediately scored two #1 hits. The first was ""We Built This City"", written by the team of Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf (producer), which was inspired by Bay Area rock n roll station KSAN-FM.

&gt; That song was trashed at the time by Kantner and later criticized by co-singer Grace Slick, and it was later declared to be the ""worst song of all time"" by Blender magazine. VH1 also named it the number-one ""Most Awesomely Bad Song"" on a top-50 countdown co-sponsored with Blender. However, it became something like a 'signature song' for Starship and has continued to receive major airplay. The band's second #1 was ""Sara""; no previous incarnation of Jefferson Airplane/Starship had had a #1 hit. 'Knee Deep in the Hoopla'  itself reached #7, went platinum, and spawned two more singles: ""Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight"" (#26), and ""Before I Go"" (#68).

&gt; In 1987, ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" was featured in the film 'Mannequin' and hit #1, although only Slick and Thomas (plus Craig Chaquico's guitar solo) appeared on it. This song made Slick the oldest female vocalist to sing on a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit, at the age of 47 (a record that she held until Cher broke it at age 53 in 1999 with ""Believe"".) The following year, with the new members Mark Morgan (keyboard) and Brett Bloomfield (bass) added. the band's song ""Wild Again"" (which reached #78 on the Billboard singles chart) was used in the movie 'Cocktail'.

&gt; By the time 'No Protection' was released, bassist Pete Sears had left. The album went gold and featured the hits ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" (#1), ""It's Not Over ('Til It's Over)"" (#9), and ""Beat Patrol"" (#46). In addition, the last song on the album, ""Set the Night to Music"", would later become a huge hit when re-recorded as a duet between Roberta Flack and Maxi Priest.

&gt; Grace Slick left Starship in 1988, having become disillusioned with the band's drift towards a strongly commercial pop image and swearing never to perform with them again. The revamped Starship lineup, featuring Mark Morgan (keyboards) and Brett Bloomfield (bass), released 'Love Among the Cannibals' in 1989. Finding their commercial prospects waning, the group finally disbanded the following year.

&gt; In 1992, vocalist Mickey Thomas revived the band, originally using the name ""Mickey Thomas' Starship"". Gaining some praise for his live performances, he changed the name to ""Starship featuring Mickey Thomas"". Lately, the band often refers to itself simply as ""Starship"", though with Thomas being its only consistent member. In September 2013, the group released their first new studio material in over two decades, putting out the tune ""It's Not the Same as Love"".

I quickly warmed to the style though and appreciated the weaving of the different (air/sea/land) perspectives into each other at the climax. I loved the fact that there was no ''soldier nursing his dying buddy in his arms'' scenes but hated the [ scene at the climax where the Commander closes his eyes expecting to die but is saved at the last second]. Aside from this it was almost cliché-free. I also loved the way the movie depicted the most mundane deaths - usually it's the combat roles that grab the most honourable mentions, but in Dunkirk it depicts those trapped below decks meeting their ends as much as anybody. The music was a bit cloying (too much ''something's about to happen'' quickening of the tempo) but otherwise sufficiently moody and dense. I was genuinely on the verge of embarrassing myself with tears a couple of times during Dunkirk, which is an amazing achievement given most films nowadays just do not resonate with me at all, plot and/or characters.

&gt; Blue Cheer is an American blues rock group of the late 1960s and early 1970s, who helped to pioneer heavy metal music. Based in San Francisco, original personnel were singer/bassist Dickie Peterson, guitarist Leigh Stephens, and drummer Paul Whaley. A power trio, the band was named after a variety of LSD promoted by underground chemist and Grateful Dead backer Owsley Stanley. This variety of LSD took its name from a popular laundry detergent. Their first hit was a cover version of Eddie Cochran's ""Summertime Blues"" from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum (1968). The single peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 chart.

&gt; The group's sound was hard to categorize, but was definitely blues-based, psychedelic, and very loud. The band has been subsequently acclaimed as an influence on garage rock, punk rock, heavy metal, and grunge. Julian Cope has written, ""In 1968, nothing but nothing in America and Britain sounded as brutal as Blue Cheer except for The Velvet Underground.""

&gt; The group underwent several personnel changes after the 1968 release of Outsideinside, and then through yet more changes during and after 1969's New! Improved! Blue Cheer (different guitarists on side 1 and 2). After Leigh Stephens was replaced by Randy Holden, formerly of Los Angeles garage rock band The Other Half, in 1968, Blue Cheer's style changed to a more commercial hard rock sound à la Steppenwolf or Iron Butterfly. For the fourth album Blue Cheer, Holden, who had left during the third album, was subsequently replaced by Bruce Stephens. Stephens later quit and was replaced by Gary Lee Yoder, who helped complete the album.

&gt; The new line up of Peterson, Ralph Burns Kellogg, Norman Mayell, and Yoder in 1970 saw the release of The Original Human Being and then 1971's Oh! Pleasant Hope. When Oh! Pleasant Hope failed to dent the sales charts, Blue Cheer temporarily split up.

&gt; From 1988 to 1993, Blue Cheer toured mainly in Europe. During this time, they played with classic rock acts as well as then-up-and-coming bands: Mountain, Outlaws, Thunder, Groundhogs, Ten Years After, Yardbirds, Danzig, Mucky Pup, Biohazard and others.

&gt; On the Nibelung Records label they released several albums. 1989 saw the release of Blue Cheer's first official live album, Blitzkrieg over Nüremberg. This album was recorded on Blue Cheer's first European tour in decades. The drum chair was then taken by Dave Salce; bass by Dickie Peterson; guitar by Duck McDonald.

&gt; 1990 saw the release of Highlights &amp; Lowlives studio album, comprised of blues-based hard rock, sometimes reminiscent of Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones, and several ballads. The album was produced by notable grunge producer Jack Endino. The line-up was Peterson on bass and vocals, Paul Whaley on drums, and Duck McDonald on guitars.

&gt; Blue Cheer followed up ""Highlights"" with the much heavier Dining with the Sharks. McDonald was replaced by German ex-Monsters guitar player Dieter Saller. Peterson was on bass and vocals again, and Paul Whaley was again on drums. Also featured is a special guest appearance by Groundhogs guitarist Tony McPhee. The album was produced by Roland Hofmann.

&gt; In the early 1990s, Peterson and Whaley re-located to Germany. Whaley still lives there. Guitar work has been handled by Duck MacDonald since that time. Blue Cheer are still active as of 2009. Peterson reunited with Leigh Stephens and performed with drummer Prairie Prince at the Chet Helms Memorial Tribal Stomp in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in Fall of 2005, and their lively performance drew old rockers like Paul Kantner and others from backstage to observe. They did some recordings in Virginia in Winter 2005 with Joe Hasselvander of Raven and Pentagram on drums. Paul Whaley has since returned to the band as drummer. The group's 2007 CD, ""What Doesn't Kill You..."", features contributions from both Whaley and Hasselvander. In 2009, Peterson died in Germany, leading to the cessation of Blue Cheer.

&gt; Blue Cheer's video for Summertime Blues made an appearance in 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, where Geddy Lee of Rush referred to the group as one of the first heavy metal bands.

&gt; The band have also been regarded as the godfathers of stoner rock bands like Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Nebula and Monster Magnet have cited their ""heavy-fuzz rock"" as a massive influence on them. Read more on Last.fm.

I'm hoping it's the start of a trend. I've been playing a lot of Total Mayhem lately and Sombra is incredibly common there. I think people are slowly catching on to how useful a silence is and how powerful EMP combos are. (Especially with Graviton Surge.)

That said, there's still a lot of misinformation going on about her. I used EMP right after an enemy Sound Barrier and the Lucio complained about the game glitching and not giving anyone the shields. Had to explain to him that EMP deletes shields and barriers.

(EDIT: To those who want to point out that Total Mayhem != quick play or competitive, yes, I know that, but Total Mayhem is pretty much the ideal environment to show off the utility of Sombra's hacks. With any luck, the mentality of hacks being useful to shut down certain characters will carry over to normal play.)",Overwatch

10009,"&gt;Umm, correct me if I'm wrong, if he got from #1 to #10... he's still a top 10 TE.

In the context of Brady v Ryan, the fact that he dropped from the #1 graded TE to #10 means that Brady only really got to play with a top a 15th or so graded guy in that time frame. 

&gt;And that's not how these grades work, by that logic you could add a bunch of mediocre WRs and they'd be more help than Julio Jones.

By definition, mediocre or average players would not contribute positive grades. Julio graded higher above mean than Sanu, Gabriel, and Hooper did combined anyway. The limited total number of offensive snaps prevents insane scenarios like this from happening. 

&gt;Gabriel had a higher passer rating when being thrown at because Matt Ryan was throwing to him lol, this is like when Tyler Lockett and Jermaine Kearse had high passer ratings when targeted last year because Russell Wilson was throwing to him.

You realize Edelman had Brady throwing to him too, right? We're comparing receivers of consensus top 3 QBs last year. The difference between their passer ratings and completion percentages was much less than that of those specific receivers when targeted.

&gt;Yeah, and Gabriel was extremely effective because the entire defense was too busy trying to figure out how to guard Julio fucking Jones when Matt Ryan was having a historical QB season while throwing to him.

WR grades are intended to be independent of QB play. Getting open on a route and not getting thrown to gives the same exact grade, unless the receiver recovers from a poor throw or makes a contested difficult catch. Gabriel still got open on his own like few other receivers in the nfl did. He might have done it against #2s, but that would just make him far and away the best #2 in the nfl when he played.

&gt;And no, another argument against receivers who take limited snaps, they have time to rest and perform at higher energy than the defenders. That doesn't make them better at all than the players who don't produce at as high of a rate on a per snap count, but still produce higher overall. That's like saying Frank Clark or Danielle Hunter are better pass rushers than Von Miller or Khalil Mack because they had higher sacks/pressures per snap, and that's not even an exaggeration, that's a literal comparison to what you're saying right now.

At this point I believe you don't understand why I use cumulative raw grades over the pff grades. Those well rested rotational players don't break the scale of cumulative grades because of their low snap counts. Having a +1.0 play from Julio or any other WR is just the same from the QBs perspective, and Ryan had an insane number of great WR plays last season. Neither Clark nor hunter came close to Miller or Mack's defensive contribution by this same grading system, so that comparison is just bogus.

&gt;Lol nice job not including Amendola's rank in the BR 1000, he was the 30th best receiver, which is an elite #2 option, and Hogan at 68 is a great #3 option.

Didn't we already disregard the BR1000 article? First of all, they aren't even measuring offensive contribution. They're measuring WRs based on 5 attributes and simply adding them together. That kind of sloppy math is far worse than say the difference between OPS and WRC+. This didn't even attempt to value the overall offensive contribution of each player in 2016, and that's what we're discussing. The fact that you call a sub-250 yard receiver in Amendola an **elite #2 option** is comical when stats and other film review completely reject that.

&gt;Umm, 16 Brady wasn't able to because he wasn't as good as 16 Ryan, but I guess that point is useless to use here. Can you give me information on 13 Manning and 11 Rodgers and 11 Brees, which imo are the only seasons in this decade better than Ryan's?

Manning team passing grade (-QB) was +35.7 in '13. '11 Brees' +30.6. Rodgers' '11 was +21.1  Ryans was *+58.1*. There's the difference and it's exactly why Ryan wasn't graded as having a a historic QB season by PFF. 

&gt;No, pff film review absolutely does not agree with Gabriel being 3rd, fucking lol, they graded him as the 21st best WR. 

Again, please understand that they scale grades so that extremely efficient receivers who play below a qualifying number of snaps don't top the player grade chart. It is a fact that Gabriel would have ranked #3 had he kept up pace for 800+ snaps. And again, whether he would have kept that pace or not is irrelevant. He still provided ryan with a half season of extremely productive WR play, and in this context, that's significant. 

&gt;And BR Top 1000, which does the best job out of the 3 of separating WR from QB play (PFF looks at whether the WR made a good play or not, but a lot of times, a great play by a WR will be diminished by a QB not seeing him on a read, or not throwing him open, which diminishes the opportunity for a WR to make a great play), and BR drops Gabriel a lot, showing the effect Matt Ryan had on him.

1, this isn't how PFF grades. They grade every route whether the receiver is thrown to or not. BR1000 doesn't do the best job of anything especially when it doesn't even attempt to valuate total offensive contribution and uses 5 traits added together like a 5th grader trying his hand at making a new statistic. 

&gt; And jesus christ, any person who actually watches film or grades receivers would tell you you're crazy if you call Taylor Gabriel an elite receiver.

Well I doubt either of us actually reviewed every one of his snaps in all-22 and graded each one last year like PFF did, so I'm gonna have to side with them. Neither I nor PFF would call Gabriel an elite receiver (in the sense that people are hesitant to crown an ""elite receiver"" after half a season), but, based on last season alone, in the snaps he did play, he absolutely played like a solid #1 playing against 2s. 

&gt;And more evidence pointing this way, Gabriel wasn't even close to this good until he played with Ryan.

He still managed to win routes on his own outside of QB play. It's not all that unrealistic for an undrafted FA to break out right after leaving a poorly coached Browns team. His routes were clearly much smoother this year than any year prior and Ryan had nothing to do with that. ",nfl

Including in the first episode, where a rape occurs in a very similar circumstance (the new bride raped by her husband). That episode, is, for instance, ranked very highly on this same list. As are other episodes where characters are raped. Those same viewers would feel that same discomfort.

Something making you uncomfortable or causing a visceral reaction doesn't make it bad or a misstep. To me, the entire conceit of Game of Thrones is that it goes for those visceral reactions, George R.R. Martin has said for instance that his series is a response to Tolkien, where the evils in the world are by and large inhuman monsters - orcs - who, as you say, nobody has to worry about coming to attack them at night. In Game of Thrones, by contrast, the horrors are by and large committed by real people and they commit the horrors in the way real people commit them. Rape, murder, betrayal, these are all things people recognize from the real world, and so the evils in Game of Thrones hit closer to home than high-fantasy escapism. The discomfort *is the point*. That may not be everyone's cup of tea, but my point is that 5 seasons into the show, there were more than enough depictions of things that should make you uncomfortable - even if we just limited to rape - that I don't get why the reaction to that scene in particular was so drastically different than all the others.

So this is the point where you will undoubtedly make the point that it's not the rape, it's essentially an argument about shot selection and Theon being featured last, which we discussed yesterday. If that's the case, it's more of a technical or cinematic criticism than a moral one. First of all, recognize that while that might be *your* criticism, for other people *it's just about the rape*, which I still don't get for the reasons above (see, for example, the person I was responding to, who states it gives him/her a primal disgust, it's an emotional, non rational response that they just don't want to see it). Like I said, I understand the response - I understand it less in the context of a show that has served that up for five seasons, but I understand that people will react that way. Fine, but it doesn't make it a misstep.

For the people in your camp, who say it was more about the fact that the last shot somehow makes it Theon's moment or makes Theon into more of the victim, that's fine too. That's not how I read the scene nor do I think it was the intent, but that's fine. But these people are ultimately taking a minor point about how they should have structured the scene cinematically and then girding themselves in the armor of moral outrage. Yeah you may not have liked that shot selection, but to then describe it as a ""disgusting choice"" as you did yesterday brings us right back to the fact that you just plain old don't like seeing rape more than anything else. It's essentially a [motte-and-bailey argument,](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey) you begin by saying the scene was disgusting, someone responds and says ""OK, so we shouldn't show rape then?,"" you retreat to ""it's not the act of rape, it's the way they ordered the shots!,"" people reasonably disagree on how the scene reads, and then you go right back to claiming the moral high ground and calling on people to stop watching the show. It's a blending of the two positions. I might not like how a director framed a scene, the shots they chose to use, but that's not the kind of disagreement or criticism that then leads to this being ""the worst episode in the history of the show"" or a ""disgusting choice."" So, to me, ultimately all the arguments about *how* it was carried out, ring rather hollow because I think this is much more about the way people react to something they don't want to see. It's sort of like Gamergaters claiming their crusade is about ""ethics in gaming journalism"" - it's a minor issue that doesn't line up with the type of rhetoric and outrage that people are offering up.",gameofthrones

And yet I *still* end pretty much every unscripted public speech with ""so... that was it"".

&gt;No, but making false accusations are.

So does sexual activity necessarily make you a liar?

Yes, it never went to trial. There were pre-trial hearings. Stop digging and actually read the article.

Please, please stop making shit up. You're not responding to my point at all, and despite my stating what part of the evidence was critical to the trial, you're somehow accusing me of not wanting it admitted? What are you talking about?

And are you also just as afraid of car accidents, lightning, tornadoes, falling down the stairs etc? How about a truck accidentally running you over? Or a mugging?How about your family members?

Oh wait I almost forgot your fear of terrorism has nothing to do with rationality and everything to do with bigotry and some twisted fantasy of preserving the white race. And for that reason you will never approach the problem of terrorism with a rational mind and look for real solutions instead of saying 'no muslims near me because a statistically insignificant number amongst them might try to kill innocent people'. With your pea brained logic let's ban all people everywhere because violent criminals who commit random acts of violence are much more prevalent among the general population than there are terrorists among muslims.

What led to the bounty was the Micmaq violating a peace treaty they had signed with the British and then murdering the residents of Halifax and the surrounding area. Shortly thereafter they took up the side of arms alongside the French and Acadians due to shared interests which is ultimately what led to the introduction of the bounty. And while it is technically incorrect to say that the Micmaq scalp bounty was never collected (it was collected once in New England in 1751 for a single scalp) it is completely ahistorical and disingenuous to suggest that it contributed to a ""genocide"" of the Micmaq people.

I am arguing that the death penalty for voluntary participation in a genocidal army is fair punishment and would be regarded as such by Americans if what had happened in Northern Iraq had happened in Washington state. 
  
Western nations hanged many war criminals at Nuremberg and Western nations still have the death penalty for lesser crimes. More to the point Iraqi law does and it is unjust to say ""No no, this white girl should be allowed to go home and face a different justice system because she is from where I am from and that is not where the victims were from"".


EDIT : I wish to add that I regard capital punishment as unwise for most crimes (as it can never be appealed) except where the state has a genuine concern that the accused represent a threat to the rule of law itself. Iraq lost control of a large swath of its territory, many cities and millions of its citizens and has the right, in my view, to apply the death penalty to those that willingly joined the organisation responsible for the mass murder of its civilians and usurpation of its power to protect them. This is the only crime I think is rightly punishable by death and if we valued the lives of Yazidis, Kurds and Arabs as highly as Europeans we would not interfere with Iraq applying that penalty.

When I was 19, I went to a theme park with two of my best female friends (J and S) during one of the Halloween-themed events. We had an absolute blast at the park and were extremely energized, thanks to great conversations and some energy drinks. Basically, we were young and went a bit nuts with each other, and it was amazing.

After we were done with the park at 3am, I drove us back home while we continued having these great convos for about an hour. We talked about it and decided that we all still weren't tired, so we would try and hang out all night together if we could. 

Unfortunately, all of us were still living with our respective parents at the time, so we had to come up with a game plan. My family was always fast asleep by 11pm or so, so we decided to meet up to spend the night hanging out in my room (which was pretty detached from the other bedrooms in the house, so we could be a bit noisy without disturbing anyone).

So we dropped off J at home because her parents had to verify that she got home safe. Her parents lived within 5 minutes walking distance of my parents, so she would sneak out and meet up with us when she had the chance. 

S lived about 20 mins away, but her parents were very lenient with her and were content to get a phonecall to explain that she had gotten back in town safely and ask if it was alright to spend the night at her friend's place. So, she stayed with me and we went to my place. She stayed outside while I came in through the front door, then I let her into my room through the window.


Now...I need to say that I had a huge crush on S at the time, so I was loving how the night was going. However, she had a boyfriend and I knew I had boundaries to respect. Despite that, she never called him to let him know what the situation was. Didn't seem to even cross her mind at the time.


Anyhow, we were in my room just talking and joking around, waiting to get a text from J to say she was heading over. The text didn't come within 10 mins like we thought it would.

S and I spread out my XL futon (which was doubling as my bed at the time) and watched some episodes of a show for a while, continuing to just talk about whatever came to our minds. We were both really enjoying it. Still no text.

7am comes around and the text never came. We assumed that J was more tired than we thought and fell asleep. We finally started to collapse from the extremely long and active night and slowly dozed off, laying on the futon facing each other and still trying to carry a conversation about our latest music interests. It didn't take long before we both just passed out.

I woke up at about 10:30am, a bit groggy. I remember trying to reposition myself, finding it harder than it should have been to move. Took a second to find out why, and there was S, snuggled up in front of me, my arms fully around her and her arms on top of them. I instantly felt the shock of realization at the situation. I had known this girl for years and had crushed on her for what felt like an eternity. I cared a lot for her and had fantasized about doing exactly this on countless occasions. So, needless to say, I was in heaven.

So I stayed put, simmering in the euphoria. I had never been so relaxed as I was at that moment, and I don't think I have been ever since. 

I fell back asleep after 10 mins or so (was still completely exhausted), not waking up until about 2pm. She was still there, perfect as ever. Then, to my surprise, she asked, ""Hey, you awake?""

I very nearly had a panic attack. Had no idea she was awake, and didn't know if she had been awake for a while. I luckily managed to calm down my addled teenage brain enough to realise that she wasn't shoving me off of her or screaming at me with accusations. She had actually sounded as relaxed as I had felt before she spoke.

I confirmed I was awake, and we got up. I decided not to bother hiding her presence from the rest of my family, mostly because we didn't do anything that warranted hiding from them. So, we went out to the kitchen and made some breakfast together.

She wasn't weird about it, and neither was I (I hope). We didn't talk about it directly, but we both seemed to feel completely comfortable with it, even though she knew she probably shouldn't have stayed the night in not-her-boyfriend's room in the first place.

Nothing ever come of it, but I would relive this night over and over again if I could.

Countries in Eastern European continue to buy gas from Russia. But selfish Germany who values its economy more than punishing Russia is endangering the security of Eastern Europe. 

&gt; Ukraine in particular is not in good shape to bear that load. The EU is less-influential if pressure can be applied to individual countries.

Like every trade, gas trade is a two way street. If Russia applies too much pressure countries will buy somewhere else. 

&gt; Secondly, being a pipeline provider provides Ukraine with some modicum of influence in the EU — and it has precious few guarantees or cards to hand.

And these ""guarantees"" are basically the main reason for building pipelines that don't go through Ukraine. Because in that case guarantee means that Ukraine will be able to take our gas supply hostage. And if they don't want to pay Russia for its gas they can just take whatever they want. 

&gt; At some point Germany is going to also want their support for things, and this is pretty important for Eastern Europe.

It should be a relative score, really.

Take ALL games played since the last patch. All leagues all over the selected region. If I'm in the bottom 33% I get bronze. Middle 33% I get silver. Top 33% I get gold. Very linear.

You can source yourself to see how many lawsuits have been publicized in the press by employees who have been harmed by the actions or inaction of their employers related to PTSD.

One RCMP officer just filed last week for constructive dismissal for suffering PTSD.

Every employer in Canada has two duties:

1). The duty to assist - requires that employers assist injured employees to the point of undue hardship.

2). The duty to refer - requires that employers refer injured employees to medical professionals when it's clear they are unable to perform their duties.

Countless cases show an endemic problem with first line responders not being assisted while injured on the job.  A simple online search should turn up many.

Let's be clear what WCB does when a claim for PTSD is received.  They require the claimant to undergo an IME - independent medical exam, except it's anything but independent.  Rather a paid hack that is hand picked by WCB will ""test"" and interview the claimant and then deny the claim for frivolous and obscure reasons.

I know one individual injured on the job, suffering from PTSD (diagnosed by both Health Canada &amp; an independent psychiatrist) who had to sue the government for compensation and permanent disability.

Griffey posted a higher OPS than Bonds' 10 year average only once in his entire career and that was the strike shortened 1994. Griffey hit .323/.402/.674

Next closest was 1993 where Griffey hit .309/.408/.617

That 1994 season was also the only year of their careers where Griffey ended up with a season long higher OPS. Bonds hit .312/.426/.647 Griffey again hit .323/.402/.674 meaning Griffey had an OPS 3 points higher, but with a much lower OBP.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/deda720fda2a4a46b4bde9bf58826614.png)  

&gt; The Grateful Dead was a rock band that formed in 1965 in San Francisco, California, United States from the remnants of another band, ""Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions,"" The Grateful Dead were known for their unique and eclectic songwriting style which fused elements of rock, folk music, bluegrass, blues, country, and jazz, and also for live performances of long modal jams. The group disbanded immediately after the death of singer/guitarist Jerry Garcia in 1995.

&gt; The Grateful Dead consisted of: Jerry Garcia (vocals, guitar; 1965-1995), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals; 1965-1995), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals; 1965-1995),  Bill Kreutzmann (drums, 1965-1995), Mickey Hart (drums; 1965-1970, 1974-1995), Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan (keyboards, organ, harmonica, vocals; 1965-1972), Tom Constanten (piano; 1968-1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971-1979), Donna Jean Godchaux (vocals; 1971-1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979-1990), Bruce Hornsby (keyboards; 1990-1992) and Vince Welnick (keyboards; 1990-1995). All of these members, with the exception of Hornsby (who was their induction presenter), were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Lyricist Robert Hunter - who wrote many of the band's songs - is often considered to be an unofficial member of the band and was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the band.

&gt; Some fans followed them from concert to concert for years. These ""Deadheads"" were renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many followers referred to the band simply as The Dead.  

&gt; The Grateful Dead, known then as the Warlocks, became the de facto resident band of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, with the early sound heavily influenced by Kesey's LSD-soaked Acid Tests. Their musical influences varied widely with input from the psychedelic music of the era, combined with blues, jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead ""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.""  

&gt; One of the most notable things about the Grateful Dead is their duration.  They were together for thirty years, stopping only upon the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995.  Their output, comprised mainly of a vast number of recorded concerts, is unmatched by any other band.
  
The music of the Grateful Dead lives on through many tribute bands as well as projects of the rest of the band.  These remaining members did perform together for a while as The Other Ones and later on as The Dead.  As The Other Ones, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzman, Warren Haynes (Govt Mule), and Jeff Chimenti (Ratdog), began touring in the spring of 2009. The Dead's music continues today as Phil Lesh and Friends and Ratdog (Bob Weir solo).  Phil Lesh and Bob Weir formed The band Furthur  in 2009 and also went touring.

&gt; To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Grateful Dead, four original members — Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, and Bob Weir — reunited for final performances together at Chicago's Soldier Field.  “Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead"" took place over three nights on July 3, 4, and 5, 2015.  The band was joined by Trey Anastasio (guitar), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards), and Bruce Hornsby (piano).   Read more on Last.fm.

11261,"I made an arguement yesterday about this which I think is quite good. So we know blizzard are okay with kill combo's, the thing about doomfist is he has his trade offs (long charge time, glass cannon, reduced movement speed during charge) to justify his kill combo. Roadhog had a kill combo that needed 3 steps with the first being a skilled hook. Doom needs 1 step with the first being a skilled charge. So instead of tweaking road hogs trade offs, eg his healing (reduce amount, increase time ect), charge (increase hook wind up time before released ect), extra health pool (acts as ult charger) then instead removed the combo. Now they are thinking about tweaking his trade offs to match his reduced combo. Personally I think this is flawed logic, I believe it more that they made a mistake and wont revert the changes to save face so instead they are justifying the changes and increasing his healing. When personally I think with the introduction of doom fist they have admitted kill combo's are fine and instead should of rebalanced hog but kept the kill combo.",Overwatch

Our results are striking and sobering. They suggest that public opposition to any further migration from predominantly Muslim states is by no means confined to Trump’s electorate in the US but is fairly widespread.

&gt;In our survey, carried out before President Trump’s executive order was announced, respondents were given the following statement: ‘All further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped’. They were then asked to what extent did they agree or disagree with this statement. Overall, across all 10 of the European countries an average of 55% agreed that all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped, 25% neither agreed nor disagreed and 20% disagreed.

&gt;“The point is that, if you were being logical, a common currency would be the last thing you introduced (after common fiscal policy, legal systems, market regulation, etc.) if you were trying to bring countries into some sort of political federation, since it would be a common currency and monetary policy that would expose all the tensions between economies.

&gt;“But the politicians reversed this argument, and saw the currency union as a forcing first step, since it would necessitate a more federal approach in other areas, such as fiscal policy, if it were to be successful.”

&gt;To back his case, Mr. Jeffrey quotes Romano Prodi in the Financial Times in 2001, when he was president of the European Commission:

&gt;“I am sure the euro will oblige us to introduce a new set of economic policy instruments. It is politically impossible to propose that now. But some day there will be a crisis and new instruments will be created.”",europe

It's cause he didn't have the play making of Bosh &amp; Wade (who, in their Primes are better than Kyrie &amp; Love, primarily because both are smarter offensive guys &amp; significantly better defenders). He's lost a little athleticism (but is still significantly more athletic than most), but is a way better scorer now.  I mean, against one of the best teams of all time, he still had a next positive of +12 in the series (iirc).

That means that if they do something wrong/something that rubs off on you the wrong way, you have absolutely no guilt in calling them out- and when they retaliate, you automatically chalk that up as something else they're guilty of on your imaginary list.

Also, the more the game becomes team focused, the more acutely you feel the drag that a teammate doing really badly causes on your chances of victory, so there's that. There's no way to win 100% of all your games, but that doesn't make it easier to swallow.",leagueoflegends

I've lived in six metropolitain areas thusfar in my life. I've gone to countless games in all these markets and also seen a handful of games in miscellaneous areas around the country. San Francisco Giants fans have been my least favorite. I'll counter this by mentioning I made several life-long friends who have been Giants fans, and are for the most part good fans. For the most part, their fans are huge douchebags. Every time I've gone to a Giants game has been a poor experience. When the games were at Candlestick, it was nothing but thugs and assholes. I've never heard so much profanity and vulgarity as the Candlestick bleachers. When they moved to AT&amp;T (Pacbell), the stadium was loaded with uppity Marin County douchebags that showed up in the 2nd and left in the 7th. It's still prevalent to this day, although there's the legion of bandwagon fans that showed up last year. When the Giants lost the World Series in 2002, I saw many, many people I know look down on those talking about the games like they were somehow above it all and acted like we were stupid just for being interested in the World Series. When they won, the same people were claiming they've been hardcore fans forever. It's not just the general asshattery, every fanbase is guilty of that. More than any other fanbase I've dealt with, however, Giants fans are incredibly stuck-up and talk more shit about other teams and fans while claiming they are God's gift to baseball. When Brian Stow got beat up, the Giants fans all came out of the woodwork saying ""This would never happen in San Francisco! Dodger fans are just a bunch of gang banging thugs!"", proving that they never went to a game at the 'Stick and probably haven't been around the city all that much. They berate Dodger fans for leaving early, and yet 2/3 of the Giant ""fans"" in the stadium wouldn't recognize Brian Wilson because they're all out wine tasting by the 8th inning. They yell profane, disgusting things at players and coaches, then hire Gloria Allred when someone says something back. They talk about Oakland A's fans not being loyal and just being Raider fans in green, when really, they're just as shitty in every respect, if not worse. I can't stand Yankee fans, but when I think of Giants fans, I just laugh. Then puke.",baseball

Just thinking outloud here more or less..

Personally for the most part I take no issue with it, there are plenty of places in public that covering your face can been seen as a problem that having say a list where  it is acceptable and not acceptable just seems silly to me. And if they would be willing to comply with such a list, than why wear it at all in public? I also get the feeling that many would feel the need to not comply with a list like that, for various reasons. On a somewhat joking level I am also personally just put off by the whole burqa thing because the genius idea behind it is that if I see a glimpse of the woman underneath that I won't be able control my sexual urges and I may just rape the shit out of her....seems a bit offensive to me..

 I know it seems like a minor inconvenience to have to ask a woman to remove her burqa for a second so that they can be identified but I imagine that there will be issues with people refusing to remove it even for quick identification purposes which leads me to think the law may expand in the future to be more like what france did. 

What I find weird is that I've been kicked out of a mall, ""banned"" officially ( I was a kid, no idea if it was acutally an official ban or just a mall cop on a power trip) for wearing a dust mask over my face (no reason why, just wanted to see how long we could wear it before someone said something). My question I guess is, what is the difference between a burqa and just wearing something covering your entire face? Why is covering your face in public completely without a medical (or another legitimate) reason for doing so viewed as almost 100 percent a no no in public, whilst a burqa is seen as perfectly fine?",worldnews

I've got good news and bad news.

**The good news** is that if you go to your local university library, and do some reading on international law, international relations, and global governance you'll get a clearer and clearer idea about how the international system works (or more to the point doesn't work).

States are the primary actors, and the rich ones have the most power.

The UN is an experiment in bringing States together to try to create multilateral solutions to global problems. No one State can solve world hunger, human rights abuses, or climate change. The only way to do that is to work together to find common solutions. There is some corruption in the UN and plenty of horse trading over important issues (vote buying and strong arm negotiations). That said, it is mostly staffed by people who want to make the world a better place and try to make decisions not based on national self interest but with consideration for all of the people of the world (this is why many american conservatives think the UN is communist).

The problem is that the UN and most of its international organizations are quite weak by themselves and have limited power beyond facilitating interactions between States.

The exception to this trend in international organizations are the Bretton Woods/Washington Consensus organizations: The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

The WTO is powerful because trade is important. That and it has been structured to have a binding dispute settlement mechanism (a rarity in the international system).

The WB is described as a bank but really what it is is a development fund. The reason people dislike the WB so much is that in the 1980's it started adding condition to loans. The conditions demand structural changes to how the recipient country runs it's government. They started to require privatization of public companies, reductions of social services, debt reductions, the movement of the economy to an export focus (often cash crops like coffee or soybeans). The end result is the WB has successfully created a rich/upper middle class in the developing world and hasn't done too much for the poorest of the poor. There is some trickle down but not much.

The IMF is more of a bank than a fund. It is considered a lender of last resort. Which means that when a country can no longer borrow from private banks to keep the country afloat (Greece) the IMF steps in and lends them money. The loans they give are very short term (1-2 years) (whereas the WB does 10-15 year loans) but because of the shortness of the term, they demand even stricter structural adjustment policies than the WB. Their goal is to dramatically turn countries around in a short period of time. The results are often harshest for the poor. Read the Shock Doctrine and complaints by Joseph Stiglitz about how this process does more harm than good. 

Keep in mind however, the countries in question approach the IMF and the WB, not the other way around. Even with a mixed track record they're goal is not to make the world a worse place but to try to bring a chaotic world back from the brink. The IMF and the WB are powerful because they have lots of money to throw around.

None of these organizations are powerful without the support of the great powers (the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, Japan) who fund and thus control them. This gives you an indication of the power of States over international organizations, particularly the power of the US to make or break the UN.

There is far more to learn but I've got you started. Dig through some textbooks (it's the best way to learn). I've spend years at this, my first degree was in political science, then I got a law degree, and I'm currently doing a master's degree in IR. All I can tell you is there are no real shortcuts to understanding the international legal system.

Now **the bad news**.

If you go to youtube, and search for NWO you will learn that the Jews (the Rothchild's) are trying to create a tyrannical world government and their primary tool of enslavement is the IMF. 

It's a simple narrative with a clear villain: The Jewish Bankers.

If you want to take the shortcut to understanding the world, follow contheory_spiracist down the youtube rabbit hole. It will give you clear answers to complicated problems. What it won't do is explain how to fix those problems other than 'hate Jews'.

**In closing**, you have rightly surmised that I don't give a lot of evidence to support my arguments (I don't back up my points with scholarly articles, web links or youtube clips). I don't do this mainly because the conspiracy true believers won't be swayed by it. So why should I bother? What I do is ask them to defend their arguments and generally all they can do is provide links to youtube videos with scary music or conspiracy websites like Alex Jones. In effect I mock them for being sold a bunch of propaganda the exact same way they mock the general public for being brainwashed by the mainstream media. I realize it's petty, but I just hate closed minded racists.


There are no shortcuts to knowledge but I'll give you a bibliography to get you started. Good luck in your search for truth.

11650,"Simple opportunity cost. By spending IP on runes, I can't spend them on champions. This means that by the time this change rolls around, I'd have forgone a lot of enjoyment from playing a variety of champions because I had to take care of the runes first. Normally, this would be fine since the people who bought champs instead wouldn't be able to enjoy them as much since their runes are probably generic AD/AP pages. However, since these guys would get runes for free (which I spent IP on) it should be fair that I get the same sort of compensation, right? 

and yes, I like having right runes on champions. It irks me when I have MR runes against a full-AD team. Or when I don't have MR against a mostly-AP team. 

Of course, I'm speaking from the perspective of me now, who just spent 3 weeks grinding so he can buy all the necessary runes and a runepage for lee sin (which I still suck at). It's true that once this change rolls around, I probably won't care anymore. I still wish for a compensation tho, probably a skin or something. That'd be nice. 

Also, I think you're speaking from the perspective of someone who already has all champions. Since that means IP is useless for you. Could be wrong, though, and you're just annoyed by people complaining about something as trivial as IP. (which you shouldn't be. IP's hard to farm dude, it takes a lot of time which you shouldn't actually spend on a game)

&gt; [Religious liberty] is largely an inheritance from a time when religions were able to extort special privileges for themselves.

Eh, nope. That would be seperation of church and state. Religious liberty is your right to worship or not worship any god you want, to follow the practices of that worship as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else and not to be treated different because of those things.

&gt; Religion is a freely chosen collection of ideas. It deserves no greater protection than political ideology.

Religions deliver a metaphysical supernatural explanation of how the world works. Anybody who says that their religion dictates how society should work outside of a general set of ethics is a) lying or b) a fundemantalist. Religion and ideology are fundamentally different concepts.

In liberal democracies we don't punish or discriminate people based on philosophical explanations. We punish people for actions. We don't prejudge people based on what they believe in a sense that it holds legal ramifications. It isn't illegal to be a Nazi, it is illegal to try to establish a society based Nazi ideals.

You quite elegantly use a concept from the new atheist movement (the idea that any religious claim has to hold up to scientific study and if it doesn't it is dangerous) and combine it with the common idea that the state has a right to defend itself based on the commonly confused terminology of religion and ideology.

The problem here is that this way you create thought crimes. Being a conservative Muslim would be a thought crime, instead of trying to establish a society under Sharia Law through illegal action being an actual crime. Except it is even worse as you violate another fundamental tenent of law in democracies: to judge individuals not groups.

Of course if there is a high probability of somebody causing politically motivated crime than the state has a right to protect itself and the population from that, but at this point we're talking known people with a criminal history who still espouse their ideology.

The entire thing is very similiar to Bush's idea that to protect people from civilians commiting acts terrorism other civilians must be tortured.

Not so in a fighting game, where there is not just a single move open for reaction but a myriad of situations. Luck simply plays no role then anymore. 

Hence, this is a very situative concept and only works if situations can be controlled by sheer luck. The more interaction there is the less luck is involved.

There will be no single beginner that can win against a pro (we are decisively talking pros here or at least high-skilled players, but not by self-claim, but by proven skills) in a whole match of SF or Tekken with simply mashing on buttons.

Erdogan knows this and he's trying to cement his rule in Turkey by all means possible, chief of which is repression of any possible detractors of his rule.

Putin is definitely the geopolitical opponent of Erdogan, Putin wants more influence in Azerbaijan and he wants to protect Armenia. He likes Assad and he uses the Kurds to his ends when it suits him. But Erdogan has supported Assad in the past, he can flip again if he has to. Erdogan can also put his ambitions in the Caucasus on the hold.

The ""Snapshotting"" is nowhere near the insane difficulties of managing as people let off, as in 90% of cases you're keeping SR up 100% of the time and using the instant cast heal for Bloodtalons before a finisher, then you use the finisher and either refresh Rake or just shred to 5 again and repeat if rake isn't close to expiring.

The difficulty comes during the windows where multiple things are falling off at once, and most people lose DPS there as they start to panic and do either shitty refreshes or let everything fall off. Either way it forces them to ""reset"" their rhythm. 

Ferals that can avoid having to reset their rhythm (it happens to all of us occasionally, no matter the skill) and reset it quickly when things go sour are the ones you see topping the meters.  That mostly just comes with time with the spec. ",wow

Small bands end up playing just as many shows while also managing their own equipment and instruments (Bieber doesn't even play anything most of the time so he just has to take care of his voice, and in big shows like his lip-syncing is often employed anyway). They also usually have to organize their own accommodations and transportation which are nowhere near as luxurious.

Bieber has it pretty damn good. Playing 150 shows like he did is par for the course when you're and performer. The only thing that is more challenging for him is the weight of fame - in every other regard as a performer he's on easy street.

I also wouldn't fault him or any other performer for taking time off. The only really crappy thing is that he cancelled rhe rest of his tour which lets down lots of fans and also costs some of them quite a bit of money since many people book travel and accommodations to go see shows, which can be nonrefundable.

11909,"You don't normally change people when you change crops.

Let me put it another way: Africa's already seen much larger-in agricultural collapses from when it redistributed colonial-era land.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_Zimbabwe#Impact_on_production

&gt; Before 2000, land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital, borrow money when necessary, and purchase modern mechanized farm equipment to increase productivity on their land. Because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies.[53] Export crops have suffered tremendously in this period. Whereas Zimbabwe was the world's sixth largest producer of tobacco in 2001,[54] in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000.[55] Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the ""bread basket"" of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population.[56] About 45 percent of the population is now considered malnourished. Crops for export such as tobacco, coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform. The main everyday food for Zimbabweans, maize, has been reduced by 31%, while small grains production has grown by 163%.[34]

If you aren't constantly in a fret about small, non-industrial farms in Africa, then you shouldn't be bothered by climate change's impact.

I strongly suspect that it's being raised for political reasons in Europe -- you have people who don't like immigration and you have people who have been worked up about climate change, so by *merging* the two, you have a potent political tool.

The US did the same thing with ""green jobs"", which let it politically merge people who wanted protected, make-work jobs, and people who were up in a tizzy about the environment.  If you have to weld together an unlikely political coalition, that's a viable way to do it.",europe

At the same time, I know girls who would have to know ahead of time if a guy was about to come over, because she would need to put on her hijab, even in her house. They would wear it at all times a male was present, but that was her choice- this was in America in 2016, and she didn't live with family and her roommates weren't even Muslim. But in that case, even when her brother came to visit, he would have to wait outside, for her to put it on. Even he doesn't see her w/o the hijab and they were freaking babies/grew up together. 

From my understanding (from an outside perspective obviously), it seemed like SHE would be deeply embarrassed and almost violated if a guy saw her w/o her hijab. Tbh, I would forget about that rule a lot, and if I had happen to see her w/o the hijab, and probably wouldn't even notice,... but she would feel weird about it. Again that's just on one experience. But in Iran, even though I'm not sure about in private, in public, if their mom was the only one w/e a hijab on, even if it weren't a legal thing, I'm sure the kid would feel embarrassed.

Konata's main point is to be sarcastic. Besides, she's the show's main character. 
Likewise, without Ika-musume, there would be no point at all to the anime. (Well, ""Two girls serve food in a cafe. Nothing happens."" would be a decent slice-of-life anime scenario, but still...)

Dembele is a unique situation where is he is a major talent who isn't that intrested in leaving and chose Celtic for his development rather than purely a stepping stone to the EPL (where he could have went).

hoaxing blog stuff and not even from climate scientists. Peer reviewd? By whom? Published? Note that there's no publication information here. It's a document created by non-scientists who apparently know how to ""print to PDF"" but what's interesting is that it's nearly identical to a [skeptic's blog](http://archive.is/V5Hgp) by [Ole Humlum a guy debunked numerous times](https://skepticalscience.com/humlum-at-it-again.html)

Having debated OP before - we see again the typical pattern of posting stuff that's not gone through any scientific peer review, or fact-checking, etc. on these blog sites what you find is that there's a scary title and leading paragraph but then a mish-mash of unscientific stuff below that represents the gish gallop. It fools those who don't read more than the titles of things.

But to really put this away as a Gish Gallop we can take a look at a random sample of the stuff to see if it passes scientific muster. So I looked at the report and I found something very interesting. 

1) Let's look at a chart from the [""Bombshell"" ""Study""](https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ef-gast-data-research-report-062717.pdf) on the percent days of temperatures over 95 F. http://imgur.com/TVOp1D5. I've debated /u/timo1200 before on this chart and pointed out to him that this is bogus because the data is unsourced (where exactly did they get this from?), and the number of devices have been reduced over the years, and many have been moved, and many are now in remote locations in places like Alaska. But having discussed this with /u/timo1200 before - I know where this chart came from. It came from Tony Heller's blog and ... read on

2) Let's look at Tony Heller's version http://imgur.com/EmrFGk8 . [[Source](http://archive.is/zGIFO)] Notice a few things: 1) The charts are identical but Heller's says it is from only 1192 stations. When I debated this before I raised the point ... hey - which stations are they? Just remote ones? Silence was the reply. Look at #1 above. It says ""ALL stations"" but then ... why are the graphs IDENTICAL? 

3) Let's put #1 above #2 and make it slightly transparent and scale it to match ... http://imgur.com/cbdbfgE 

The charts are identical but suddenly it's gone from ""1192 stations"" to ""all stations."" It's gone from 9% to 4%. And all that ... with NO change in the actual graph. 
http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI

And so in all of the above - one asks - where's the link to the original data used? What's the methodology for generating those two identical graphs with widely different Y-axes?  http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI. 

I would guess that when you get two identical graphs but completely different Y-axis that this is either incompetence or fraud. But because NONE of these sites actually disclose the actual data used to create the graphs - I would lean toward guessing that they are just making stuff up. 

So .... not just a gish gallop. But made up charts as well to try to fake a point. Sad at best and dishonest at worst. ",conspiracy

1. Obamacare/medicare. Yeah 71 percent are enrolled in medicare, and they otherwise would not have access to healthcare, so I'm missing your point.

2. Auto Bailout. And he took a Lot of political flack for that, bc by the time the Auto industry needed a bailout, the American population was tired of bailing large companies out. Initially I wasn't sure it was a good idea either. But it worked.

3. Healthcare. 20mil plus people lose coverage, and the fees go up across the board. Yes, I don't like it, and neither does like 85ish percent of the country. What he ran on, was ""make it cheaper. make it better."" and neither of those ideals are worked out in the bill.

4. I don't think many people like the idea of useless infrastructure. The bridge to nowhere comes to mind. This wall is useless. Look at the statistics of how people enter the country. They just overstay their visas. Democrats, and formerly Republicans, used to like roads and bridges.

5. Coal. Opening up a mine with 70-100 positions is not bringing back the coal industry. Obama's ""War on Coal"" was just political grandstanding. Coal isn't as cheap as natural gas. So this is just the market's war on coal.",worldnews

12200,"Ok. You want to cherry pick? Let's do that.

&gt;At the age of 15, the Toronto-born son of Ahmed Khadr, a ""senior associate"" of Al-Qaeda, was **alleged** to have thrown a grenade that killed one American soldier and wounded another in the early stages of the Afghanistan conflict... 

It has never been proven Khadr threw that grenade. They found him unconscious and took him into custody. 

Even if he did throw the grenade, what would you do if you were under attack by an army? You'd fight back. It was a war. That's what happens in wars, people get killed. It's not a 'crime'. 

&gt;...After being captured and detained he was sent to to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and subsequently Guantanamo Bay where he endured years of torture and abuse. Officially, he pleaded guilty and confessed (he now argues his confession was under duress) to ""murder in violation of the laws of war""...

There is no such crime. The US government can write whatever ridiculous laws they want, they can intentionally avoid declaring war to try and get around their own laws, they can invent new categories of combatants, and nobody else has to pay any mind to that in their own national courts because it's complete bullshit. 

&gt;... she left a great deal of the nuance of the case out for viewers, omitting most of the facts about Khadr's ordeal—not once mentioning he was a child or that he claims his confession was made under duress....

&gt;...The first half of her sentence is an exaggeration. The fact is, some sort of compensation seemed inevitable. Throughout the course of his imprisonment, it was revealed Khadr was mistreated to the knowledge of the Canadian government. In 2008, The Toronto Star revealed that while the government was maintaining he was being treated ""humanely"" Khadr was being mistreated by the United States government in Guantanamo. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that Khadr's human rights were in fact being violated at Guantanamo. The decision wasn't made in a vacuum when it was acknowledged the Canadian government was aware their citizen was abused by another government as a child and adult and did nothing to stop it...

&gt;Rempel: ""The prime minister has said this was done for some sort of financial reason to save money, but the reality is that this was a decision made by his government and not by a court of law.""

&gt;Fact-check: The first half of this sentence is accurate. From Trudeau, himself.

&gt;""If we had continued to fight this, not only would we have inevitably lost, but estimates ranged from $30 to $40 million that it would have ended up costing the government,"" he said. ""So this was the responsible path to take.""...

Yes, Trudeau paid it to put an end to it and prevent having to pay more in the future, on legal fees, and probably a bigger settlement. What is wrong with that? Nothing. It would have been stupid to drag it out further. What happened to him was a Charter violation. The government was not going to win, even if it was a Conservative government. She is making it sound like Trudeau wanted to pay Khadr, for fun. 

&gt;But back to Rempel.

&gt;...This decision is not the first of its kind. In 2007 Canadian citizen Maher Arar was awarded $11.5 million along with a formal apology by (Conservative PM) Stephen Harper's government after spending 10 months being tortured in a Syrian prison. Of course, because Rempel did not mention what Khadr endured at all, the point of why Khadr was awarded a $10 million never really came up.

&gt;As for it being a government decision, yes it was. But it wasn't made in a court-less vacuum. The courts had made multiple rulings and the Liberals had lawyers giving them advice...

This is one of the examples where she was technically telling the truth. 

&gt;Rempel: ""What was disappointing for me as a legislature and for my colleagues was that this decision happened after our House of Commons, which is similar to your Congress, rose for the summer. So right now we're not sitting. We usually have an opportunity to ask questions like 'why did this happen?'""

&gt;Fact-check: True. While it didn't happen in a vacuum as Rempel suggested initially, it's true that representatives aren't currently sitting and there's no question period to demand answers from the Liberals.

And, it's meaningless. Her only true statements are like this. Yes, Parliament is not sitting right now. That has no relevance. 

More dissembling and dancing around:

&gt;...Fact-check: Bringing up the families of the soldier, Christopher Speer who was allegedly killed by Khadr, and Layne Morris, who was blinded by a grenade, Rempel suggested that Khadr being awarded his settlement ""probably pre-empted and prevented Tabitha Speer [Christopher Speer's widow] from obtaining those assets"" suggesting because Khadr was awarded he somehow took away from any settlement she might receive from the Canadian government. In reality, Speer's widow attempted to freeze Khadr's payout because she's currently trying to sue him in Utah for $134.1 million. Tabitha Speer accused Khadr of hiding assets in her attempt to freeze his payout, which the judge promptly denied.

&gt;Rempel: ""Canada values the relationship we have based on our men and women in uniform serving shoulder to shoulder with each other and I think there are a lot of people going, 'How did this happen and why?' Again, I think our prime minister has to answer.""

&gt;(When asked by Carlson why the prime minister didn't call Speer's widow) ""I'm sure that's something the prime minister should answer for, I know [former] prime minister [Stephen] Harper has reached out to her."" 

&gt;Fact-check: Again, Rempel is framing this as though the issue at hand has to do with what Omar Khadr served time in prison for. The settlement has nothing to do with what he may have done when he was 15 or how Canada honours their relationship with the United States. He's not getting money as a reward for his crimes that he served time for. The settlement and apology are only about the crimes committed against him as a prisoner with the Canadian government's consent.

&gt;The one thing this interview largely missed was context. Before the interview aired, Carlson began introduced the segment by saying ""crime does pay,"" adding Khadr would be the richest man in your neighbourhood. Going on to explain how he ""made his money"" Carlson told a heavily skewed version of Khadr's story in which he joined the Taliban, and was sent to Gitmo for killing a man. He then went on to tell his audience, ""Lucky for Khadr, he was born a Canadian citizen so after being released he sued the government of Canada for his imprisonment."" Again, drilling into the point that Khadr's settlement had more to do being rewarded for his crimes than torture, Carlson said Trudeau gave Khadr an official apology for ""being mean"" to him.

&gt;Rempel was slightly more generous in the words she used, but she too largely ignored all context. Rempel not only conveniently omitted that Khadr was a 15-year-old kid at the time of his arrest, that his rights as a Canadian were violated under the government's eye, and that he claims he confessed under duress—she repackaged facts for an American audience. While none of this is surprising considering how often Tucker Carlson has been caught spreading falsehoods on air, seeing a Canadian MP fuel right wing American panic is more than a little bit concerning in this current environment.

Everything she said in that interview was exaggerated, taken out of context, lies, misleading, and intended to rile up conservatives on both sides of the border by leaving facts out and appealing to emotions. The few things she said that were true were irrelevant, like the fact that Parliament is in recess. It was a highly irresponsible thing for her to do. 

The journalist is being professional in empirically dissecting Rempel's misleading statements and Tucker Carlson's duplicity. I get that you don't like the results, but that's no reason to accuse the journalist of having poor writing skills and injecting her opinion into it. You're basically saying she's writing fake news - a typical response from Conservatives when presented with facts. You turn it around and say the facts are fake, and the lies are the real news.

The closest thing to what you're talking about is the Music Genome Project, wherein volunteers tag songs with characteristics (bright synths, dancey beats, 12/8 time, to name a few). Pandora is the practical manifestation of the Music Genome Project, where you give it a song/artist that you like, and characteristics that are specific to what you gave it are matched to the characteristics of other bands. They do list these characteristics, however, so if you want to discover what makes a good song for you, just look at 'em and list which ones you keep seeing.

Next year is another transition year since I don't see the Mets making any major moves in the offseason due to their financial situation.

What financial situation?  They have 55 million dollars coming off the books, their own regional sports network, a brand new stadium where everything costs more money than God, where they're drawing over 30,000 a game for the year and close to 40,000 over the past 6 weeks, and Citibank pays them $20 million just to slap their name on the front door every year.

It wasn't like I was doing anything embarrassing, it's just every time I would get in the car or happen to look over at her, she would be filming me.

It was a decent joke, and she got what she wanted from it for a while until I got tired of it. I started doing inappropriate things to make it so she could no longer post the snapchat without being trashy. Sometimes I would grab her tits, other times I would pull out my wang (not in public, obviously); anything I could do to make that video useless was fair game. It was all in good fun and she usually laughed along with me.

One fateful afternoon she picked me up behind my University's library for dinner. I saw her with her stupid phone filming me as always and so I prepared the sabotage. I open the door and immediately start undoing my pants. She just gives me this empty stare unlike any other time i've pulled this crap. I then hear her squeak, ""I'm facetiming my mom... She wanted to say hi...""

A little part of me died that day. She comes from a pretty conservative church background and let's just say we have both stopped our little game.

Yes, it is: ""In Islam, right from the beginning, fulfillment of the basic needs of everyone who is unable to meet his/her needs was conceived to be the concern of the State. Zakat is the first institution of social security in Islam. Payment of 2.5 percent of his/her savings for the zakat fund is one of the fundamental duties of a Muslim. The State is responsible to collect zakat and make arrangements for its distribution. Non-payment of it is equivalent to waging war against the State. The Caliph Abu Bakr subjugated by force all those who refused to pay it.""

*In this case arguing something that isn't quantifiable is a pointless waste of time. It may or may not still have come about without f funding from the churches. You say it woulndnt have, I think its absurd to think it wouldn't have.*

I am not saying it wouldn't have, but without that funding we would be far behind where we are today. If you are going to try to argue otherwise, I suggest you imagine a world without any universities whatsoever, because that is the world you are suggesting. How much scientific advancement would we have today without them? The same can be said about the height of the scientific revolution. It is no small coincidence that the timing of the rise of the western world began with the creation of numerous, church funded universities. Before that, the knowledge base these universities were founded on was thanks to the work of monks in monasteries toiling away and copying manuscripts their entire lives to preserve knowledge, or through the translations acquired from the ---&gt;MUSLIM&lt;--- world. Please try to tell me how the scientific advancements we have today could have occured at the time they did without religion.

*That whole paragraph is just nonesense ramblings. Wtf are you even trying to say here?*

Reading comprehension, how does it work?

*Religion is created by by humans so it has human flaws, it is not impossible for us to move away from our nature into developing new ideas without being hindered by old disproven ideas. Religion is what holds on to that dearly and it is the fault of religion that so many humans maintain this trait.*

This is the paragraph that doesn't make any sense, as I was attempting to point out. How can religion be both bad because of human flaws, and cause the human flaws that make it be bad? If you are arguing religion is a manifest of human flaws I might agree with you, but to argue that those flaws would disappear without religion is pretty naive.

*No, I'm trying to explain my point in a way that makes it easier for you to understand. I would have thought it would be clear to anyone that when I was talking about a revolution in scientific disvovery in which Islamic run countries and theocracies were left behind I was referring to a specific timeline. What you're doing right now is deflecting. You're focusing ona minute detail that is seemingly unimportant in the bigger point and ignoring that regardless of what time period I was referencing it doesn't change that what I said was true.*

I am not sure that was clear at all. The worlds you said were scientific revolution. That is refering to a specific event. That's like me saying the American revolution occured in the 1800s, and then saying, oh, obviously I meant the revolution of the South against the North. When you use the proper name of something, you are referring to that something. That you are now arguing you were referring to something different is trying to cover either your lack of knowledge of history, or your poor communication skills. At any rate, I'll accept it was the later, rather than the former. 

As to your second point, no, it is not true. Actually, the Muslim world wasn't left behind because of anything to do with religion. It was a hell of a lot more complex than that, and I could really write a lot on that. At the same time, Europe becoming much more advanced had nothing to do with it somehow escaping religion. I suggest you read Newton's book sometime and see how many times he references god. Europe was still a very christian place at the time of the scientific revolution and industrial revolution. Indeed, trying to blame religion for either the rise of Europe or the fall of the Muslim world really gives it far too much credit, sort of like the people who claim Rome fell because of those damned Christians.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/85ecf9804e0048d0c88c08f6303f783c.png)  

&gt; Yazoo (known as ""Yaz"" in the U.S.) were an English synthpop duo from Basildon, UK.

&gt; Yazoo were formed in early 1982 by former Depeche Mode songwriter Vince Clarke (synthesizers) and English singer Alison Moyet (vocals) and signed to Mute Records in the United Kingdom.

&gt; Their debut single ""Only You"" was released on 15 March 1982 and rose to number 2 on the UK charts.  They also released two studio albums: Upstairs at Eric's in 1982 and You and Me Both in 1983.

&gt; Shortly after the release of the second album, Moyet and Clarke decided to break up.  Moyet pursued a solo career while Clarke first founded (the short lived) The Assembly followed by the successful Erasure.

&gt; Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet briefly reunited in 2008 and toured Europe and the United States as Yazoo for the first time in twenty-five years.  Also in 2008, their record company issued a 4-disc box set called In Your Room; containing remastered editions of both of their original albums, a disc of b-sides and remixes (imaginitively titled B-Sides and Remixes) and a DVD containing promotional videos, interviews etc.

&gt; Official website is at: www.yazooinfo.com

I know that my school for example had a pretty even ratio -- sports, English, German, religion, chemistry, physics, math teachers were male in my case (single data point).

And on top of this, student-teacher relationships have a lot more to do with the style (authoritative vs understanding, dry vs engaging, etc) of the teacher rather than their gender. I had good and bad impressions of/relationships with male and female teachers both. And more than that, how much I learned in their classes was completely unintuitive too. For example, I really liked physics as a subject (as in it's one I cared about) and our male physics teacher was always funny and engaging, reality oriented, and nice, yet I did worse in his class than in some others.

Time is a messy concept, I don't know what it is so I cannot speak of it with confidence, it is transitory in a sense and seems to be an emergent property of being aware, i'm not sure it exists outside of consciousness but is instead a mechanism by which we can navigate reality.

Roll the paper around that - the tube should have some zig zags in the middle. Put that in the end of the rolling paper, so that like a little bit is protruding from the end. After you roll you'll push that into the joint to help pack. Put your ground bud in the rolling paper, enough so that you can wrap the paper around. Lick the glue, tuck the paper at the filter, and carefully roll it. Stick it, and pack the weed into the joint. I use the end of a pencil since it's what I have.

13042,"Jesus Christ. ""Residential school"" is not another name for boarding school. I'm going to extend you the courtesy of assuming that you don't know much about Canada's history. Honestly, I don't know what kind of research you've been doing, but I'm pretty sure it hasn't been academic or particularly thorough. 

The residential school system was essentially developed as a sort of program of cultural genocide. The first schools were opened in the late nineteenth century, and the last one closed in 1996. The 60s scoop was a next step implemented by the government in the 1960s, where children were taken away from their families and ""fostered"" with white families. Hundreds of thousands of children were removed from their families and communities, often by force, or at least, the families didn't have any choice but to participate. 
Here's a few links to get you started.

Here's a short blurb on some of the greater injustices of The Indian Act, which is the body of legislation that the government has been using to govern the indigenous populations of Canada up to and including present day.  https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/21-things-you-may-not-have-known-about-the-indian-act-

""And I'm going to ignore that little racist outburst because you seem to mistake the Catholic Church (among others) for ""white people"" 

First off, I am white, and I'm as WASPy as they come. I've also had the benefit of a pretty thorough education in Canadian history, and I do realize that not everybody has had that privilege. 

But here's the thing. Put your own ego aside for a minute, and think about this. If your parents and grandparents, and aunts and uncles had been stolen by the Canadian government - and for most, that's what it amounted to, the theft of children - and raised in a massively abusive system where thousands of little kids DIED, would you say ""oh, that was the church and the government, not all white people""? 

If your family lost your language because your parents were beaten every time they spoke it, would you say ""oh, that was the church and the government, not all white people""? 

If you were aware that the British government had PROMISED IN WRITING that you would retain your lands and your freedom, and then you were locked onto reserves and LEGALLY not allowed to leave them, and all that land that they promised they would not steal from you would you say ""yeah, that government is terrible, but, not all white people""? 

If you knew that your parents weren't legally able to VOTE when they was younger because they were status Indians, would you say that? Indigenous people weren't given the right to vote until 1960. 

These are all things that are part of the living memories of indigenous people, right now, today, in Canada. It's not two hundred years ago, it's not one hundred years ago. This stuff was happening in LIVING people's lifetimes. 

There's much more to talk about, but I'll leave you with some of that to chew on.

They didn't do it right. 

The difference I think is Hook -&gt; Shoot -&gt; Kill was pretty much 90% of roadhogs playstyle. It was his entire gameplay. So now it's gone with left with this hero who just doesn't feel good to play.

Hanzo on the other hand is not entirely built around scatter arrow. It's a tool in his overall arsenal. I think it's mental that people think it's okay in it's current state. The hero is dire outside of scatter arrow. They need to re balance his abilities power budget.

&gt; Stop trying to compare heroes which are nothing alike.

I'm not comparing the heroes. I'm comparing the similar situation. 

&gt; You have to be behind their shield/matrix 80% of the time, and you have to be able to actually hit their feet accurately. It doesn't need a nerf, it's not like you can aim in the general vicinity of heroes and get kills like pharah/junkrat.

I actually think it's far too easy to use at the moment. You can just fire it into a room if you think someone is in there. If their squishy it'll do like 50% - 100% of their health and a tank will lose like 50% of their hp. It's crazy and is the least skillful part of his kit.",Overwatch

&gt; Roy Smeck (born Leroy Smeck, 6 February 1900 – 5 April 1994) was an American musician. His skill on the banjo, guitar, steel guitar, and especially the ukulele earned him the nickname ""Wizard of the Strings."" 

&gt; Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Smeck started on the vaudeville circuit. His style was influenced by Eddie Lang, Ikey Robinson, banjoist Harry Reser, and steel guitarist Sol Hoopii. Smeck could not sing well, so he developed novelty dances and trick playing to supplement his act.

&gt; On 15 April 1923, Stringed Harmony, a short film starring Smeck made in the Lee DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process premiered at the Rivoli Theater in New York City.

&gt; On 6 August 1926, Warner Brothers released Don Juan starring John Barrymore, the first feature released in the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system. On the program was a short film, His Pastimes, made in Vitaphone and starring Smeck, which made him an instant celebrity.

&gt; Smeck appeared in the film Club House Party (1932) with singing star Russ Columbo. He also appeared with Columbo in That Goes Double (1933) which featured Smeck on a screen divided into four parts, playing steel guitar, tenor banjo, ukulele, and six-string guitar simultaneously.

&gt; Smeck played at Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential inaugural ball in 1933, George VI's coronation review in 1937, and toured globally. He appeared on television on variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen, and Jack Paar.

&gt; Smeck invented and endorsed the Vita-Uke and other stringed instruments marketed by the Harmony Company of Chicago.

&gt; He made over 500 recordings for various companies, including Edison Records, Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, Decca Records, Crown Records, RCA Records and others. He also wrote instruction/method books and arrangements for the instruments he played.

&gt; Latin singer/songwriter, Piero de Benedictis was born in Italy in April 1944, making his debut in the mid-'60s while performing Italian songs in Argentina. 

&gt; In 1969, after winning a local festival with a Spanish-language tune titled ""Como Somos,"" Piero recorded his first album. Due to the local political contingency, the artist went into exile in 1976, living in Panama, Italy, and Spain. A show called La Gran Vuelta de Piero (The Great Piero's Return) was set up to celebrate his comeback in 1981. That performance was recorded and released as a double album titled Calor Humano. 

&gt; In 1985, Piero started touring all over Latin America along with musician José Toherkaski. A side project to help teenagers from modest families became his major goal soon after. 

&gt; In 1995, Piero produced a charitable record to help Unicef on its fight to protect children rights, getting contributions from artists such as David Gilmour, Joaquín Sabina, Annie Lennox, and León Gieco, issuing Canciones Blindadas in 2001, comprising old songs and previously unreleased material.

But if Jon kills them too, he will probably squash the last remnants of some ancient houses in the north, meaning there are two life long allies of the Starks that were repaid for thousand years of loyalty and one moment of weakness, in which they only hoped for the best outcome of their own people, with the absolute oblitaration of their ruling family.

13205,"Those people infuriate me.  You can't reap all the benefits of the things paid for by taxes and then turn around and claim that paying taxes violates the social contract.  Those people can go fuck themselves.  We all have to contribute to society.

Incidentally, we'd probably save a lot of money if we just dealt with mental health and other health problems sensibly.  I mean, how many people right now are less productive than they could be simply because they can't afford medication or therapy that they need?  So they feel sick and can't work as much or work at all?  Think of all those sick days.  All those people not working.  All that government assistance.  Actually, it's even worse than that because many people with mental illness who don't get treatment end up in prison because they fall short of NCR-MD and it costs a fortune to imprison someone in this country.  Now, imagine we had just paid for that medication.  Or given them therapy.

So, I think it is very likely that we'd break even or better if we just improved our healthcare system.  Not right away of course, it would be expensive at first because it would take an initial investment of money and take time to bring about the desired effect.  But, if we really tried hard, did all the right things, and were willing to spend that money, I think we could do it.  

However, I think you're right.  People are short-sighted and they don't want to spend money on others who they perceive are undeserving.  They think it is wasteful and they just want a tax cut for themselves, even if that is objectively worse in the long-term for literally everyone.  When they understand the issue or when it is someone they know, it is different, of course, but most people aren't like that.  Most people don't understand mental illness and most people don't *think* they know someone who is or has been mentally ill.  Probably we need to focus on educating people first.  Because frankly, with attitudes as they are today, I would never reveal if I had a mental illness.  Frankly, I wouldn't tell people about *any* condition constituting a disability if I could conceal the information, considering the prejudices people have.

We are where we are right now. But what could we expect to see if this trend continues?

Further drops in sperm count would render many males effectively infertile. A the average guy would still be able to get a woman pregnant, but the chances of this happening get lower and lower as sperm count drops. 

In short, you've got birth control via lowered statistical probability. To people who believe there's a population control agenda, this makes perfect sense. Why? Because it's a very good way to get birth rates down without creating concern or suspicion.

Another effect of the lower testosterone is that (in terms of your endocrine system) many men become hormonally transgendered. Lower testosterone levels have a whole range of effects. Lower muscle mass and lower levels of dominance/assertiveness/aggressiveness are a couple of these.

Again, these effects make a lot of sense to those who believe there's an overall agenda for pacification of the public.

1) Why would Lyanna tell Ned that Robert would kill the baby if he found out about him if the child was his? He'd be ecstatic to know he and Lyanna, his one true love, have a child together.

2) This is the biggest one, there is no way Robert and Lyanna had sex 9 months before the birth. Robert's Rebellion lasted close to a year, the kidnapping of Lyanna by Rhaegar happened *before* the rebellion even started. The rebellion started after Lyanna was kidnapped, Ned Stark's father and brother rode to King's Landing to demand her back, and Arys demanded Ned Stark &amp; Robert's heads from John Arryn. There's just no way Robert snuck off to impregnate Lyanna, left her with the man he thought was raping her and then went back to the rebellion.

Now, you can argue that someone else might be Jon's father, but as far as the show as concerned, we know it's Rhaegar Targaryan, because HBO put out an [infographic](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-connections-ned-promise-tower-of-joy-infographic) with Jon Snow's family tree and it lists Rhaegar as the father.

SCC: ruled on whether Khadr was tortured.

Utah: ruled on whether Khadr killed Sgt Speer.

Neither decision excludes any result from the other decision, and (not that it's relevant) neither decision dealt with whether Khadr's confession was made under coercion or otherwise false. The judgment that Khadr's owes the Speer family money for killing Sgt Speer is not contrary to the SCC decision.

As far as the quality of the NA LCS goes, going into this tournament there was this following idea: There is this Top 4, consisting of Cloud9, TSM, CLG and Immortals and that there was a Bottom 6, who might take a game off of the Top 4 teams in a while but not being a real threat. But in reality, it’s a mix. I think every NA fan is surprised at how poorly EU is doing, and I’m not sure whether it’s them slumping or everyone underrating NA as a region. I do think that P1 have figured out their team though, that the 3-2 record isn’t a fluke and that they’ll reach playoffs. They should keep going being a fairly strong team and I think that this experience should improve their abilities.

The provincial law societies are meant to be politically neutral, though increasingly they have committees that reflect ""mainstream"" political dialogue, like LSUC's racialized licencees project.

&gt; Established as one of Europe's best Tech-House scenes hitmakers, Thomas Bruckner aka TOMCRAFT has catapulted himself this past year through various charts in different countries. He is specialized in progressive house and progressive trance and is better known for having created the tracks “Loneliness” and “Prosac”, working alongside Eniac.

&gt; Tomcraft began working as a DJ in Munich in 1994, shifting between techno and the emerging progressive trance style. The following year, he released his first track, “This Is No House”. He first met in Eniac in 1996, and the two immediately started producing music together, beginning with “Viva”. The same year yielded the track “Prosac”, but this did not achieve success until it was re-released in 2001.

&gt; 2002 was also the year Tomcraft released “Loneliness”, a progressive vocal track that eventually reached #1 in the UK [1]. The financial success allowed him to found his own record label, Great Stuff Recordings, followed up in 2005 with Craft Music.

&gt; His song “Overdose” was featured in the 2003 movie Party Monster for its parallel theme of drug use to the Club Kids of New York City.

&gt; But he not only gained attention as a producer of various chart hits, he also established himself as an internationally requested Top DJ with unrivaled success since 1993. 

&gt; This has been seen time and again with appearances in Germany at MAYDAY, LOVE PARADE, ENERGY, NATURE ONE and with an international following in the USA (NYC, Miami, San Francisco etc), Columbia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and throughout Europe, from Istanbul to Estonia plus several appearances in the biggest UK clubs such as THE GALLERY, GODSKITCHEN, TANGLED or PROMISE.

&gt; The year 2004 will see TOMCRAFT as one of the busiest DJs around, playing tours in the US, ASIA and AUSTRALIA.

&gt; Being Munich label `KOSMO RECORDS' No1 seller, TOMCRAFT is responsible for numerous productions and chart hits. Together with his producer Robert Bormann aka ENIAC, TOMCRAFT has created hits such as ""THE MISSION"", ""THE LORD"" ""THE CIRCLE"" TV series .Others such as ""SILENCE"", ""PROSAC"", ""OVERDOSE"" and his latest U.K. number 1 hit ""LONELINESS"". In 2001 TOMCRAFT was also nominated for an ECHO AWARD in the category of best dance-act. In 2003 TOMCRAFT won 3 Germand Dance Awards for BEST ALBUM, BEST RADIO HIT and BEST DANCE TRACK. His Remix work is, with no doubt, one of the heaviest around and the list of Remix Projects is a never-ending story. BBE (7 days and one week), FUTURESHOCK (late at night), SIMPLE MINDS (spaceface), PET SHOP BOYS (flamboayn), DAVE GAHAN (bottle living) are just some of the heavily played remixes by TOMCRAFT.

Other than the Negro Leagues, there were lots of leagues out there (tons of independent teams and leagues) in the early days of baseball and presumably some of those guys made it to the AL or NL, and many did not. But it's kind of nonsense to assume there were other players who would have been playing in the American League and would have been so good that Gehrig would have been dragged down substantially. Who knows? Maybe Gehrig would have performed well against them too. I think if the talent pool were expanded, you would probably see the average player's skill rise but I think the top guys would still really, really stand out.
  
I don't want to diminish Albert's accomplishment at all, he's an all-time great and had a shot to be the best player of all time. He'll just have to settle for being one of the best.

There are just so many differences between these eras that we'll never know.

The same things that make people good baseball players (baseball IQ, reaction time, strength, speed, etc.) --- people had those qualities in the 1930's too.   
  
Though to be fair, we have seen many scrub MLB players go to like, the KBO or the NPB and absolutely dominate. Can we compare the MLB of the 1930s to AAA? To NPB? To the Mexican leagues? How do we come up with a good comparison?

13673,"&gt; I'm saying that he's more likely to increase more in usage and make incremental increases to his ppg than to just balloon to 30 points a game, at his current rate.

I mentioned 25ppg next season, but I'd expect him to stay around there for at least a couple years.

&gt; But the goal should be to become more efficient, as to not waste possessions. Out of every player who's ever averaged 30+ points and averaged 5 assists, a field goal percentage of .423 (which he has now) would be the second worst of all time, sandwiched in between two A.I seasons. Are you honestly telling me you would rather have someone average 30 on bad efficiency than say, 26-27 on great efficiency?

I think the biggest factor is age and team situation here. Suns are a young developing team and with the addition of Jackson to help facilitate, I think Booker is in a great position for the future. Odds tend to favor a player improving efficiency overtime rather than declining (until the drop off after prime). Supporting cast plays a role as well. Of course, I'd hope he'd have better than .423 by the time he's close to averaging 30~ ppg and I think doing it on around .44-.45 would be reasonable. I mean I understand the point you're trying to make, but I imagine if we took the FG% of a few historically great scorers from their first or second year and eventually had 30~ ppg seasons, they'd rank pretty low too. There are also very few players who eventually averaged 30 ppg (or close to it) that already averaged 22 ppg in their second year.

You've bought one player, and potentially might lose Ozil and Sanchez. It's a long summer, who knows what will happen, but buying a striker isn't going too magically solve all of Arsenals issues. There are so many mental, balancing and defensive issues at Arsenal that I don't think throwing money at a few players this summer is going to fix the problem.

13735,"It's not that players on two-way contracts will all be released. It's a question about who is in charge of giving permission to their players to leave. For a player signed to a two-way deal *who is playing in the AHL next spring*, I see two possible rulings:

- Interpretation 1: When an NHL club loans a player to the AHL, the AHL team now has the power to choose how to manage that player. They can give him first line minutes, or sit him in the press box. With that in mind, while the player is on the AHL roster, they're within their rights to loan him to a national team instead of playing him in the AHL.

- Interpretation 2: The AHL team only controls the player at the discretion of the NHL team, since it is the NHL team that signed him to the contract, so the NHL team retains the right to make that decision. 

At the end of the day, obviously both teams would be involved in any decision to send a player overseas, but the distinction on who has the right to release/loan a player who is on an NHL deal playing in the AHL is still interesting. For example, I could see NHL teams being interested in loaning out some of their young prospects to play in the Olympics, and pushing Interpretation 1 as a way to make that choice themselves. But if they don't want any association with the hockey tournament, they could choose Interpretation 2. ",hockey

13849,"First time watcher, first time participating in a rewatch, have posted in most of the threads.

Well now we know why the show's called Love Live. The show's plot moved forward heavily - we had progress on the student council president, saving the school, improving the girls, and figuring out who was filming things. The episode was so dense with plot and characterization that I went back and watched it again.

Hanayo was pretty adorable nerding out over the idols; she really does become a different person when she gets to let out her inner otaku.

Maki is back to being best girl and being the mature voice of reason. For a first-year she seems like the oldest of them. Her embarrassment at being photographed was incredibly endearing, and her fearless confrontation of the student council president was an awesome moment.

With the exception of the breast-grabbing, I was a big fan of how frequently Nico got shut down. I mean, on top of Honoka shutting down Nico's attempt to show off how informed she was, they literally shoved her into a room and closed the door. I actually felt bad for her on the first viewing; on the second, I realized she was being obnoxiously self-important. And while Nico is clearly not book smart or as smart as she thinks she is, I thought her attempt to use her Nico-Nico personality to improve her studies was smart. She has some depth to her.

I know that Honoka is a bit of an airhead, but her math skills are just... a whole series of educators failed that poor girl. I liked seeing her back in her casual outfit; I just really love that look.

Eli's development was probably the most interesting thing about the episode. The revelation that she's being such a raging colossal bitch to the idols because she thinks she's better than them isn't a huge surprise; the fact that she actually has reason to believe that to be true is. And she does clearly care about her family; she's got that Russian coldness, but she loves her sister and her grandmother - and the school that her grandmother loved as a child. I hope she takes an enormous chill pill, because while I like her characterization and writing, I'd like to like the character, ya know?

Cultural notes: I get the feeling that a Live is a term for a concert or something in Japan. The show showed how seriously the senpai/kouhai relationship are taken when Maki backed down on her confrontation with Eli. I think maybe that contributes to why the girls didn't go screaming to the cops when Nozomi kept repeatedly assaulting them. Like, I get to a certain extent that there's a trope in anime that ""it's okay if they're both girls,"" and I feel like that contributed to me being less appalled than I thought I would be when I saw it. That, and the first girl to get the ""treatment"" was Nico, who I love to hate. I felt disturbed with myself for feeling like it was normal.

Also, I finished Re:Zero, and I noticed that Subaru from that show used the -chi honorific as well. In that show, it implied great familiarity and also a certain babying/moetization. It was very interesting to me that Nozomi kept referring to Eli with the -chi honorific, implying greater closeness between them than I expected. On the other hand, she also used -chin for Honoka, and she *clearly* has issues with people's boundaries and propriety, so maybe that's just how she is.

As an educator I was interested to see Honoka's grades - grades in other anime seem to be out of 100, but she got a 53. That wouldn't be a pass in most educational systems I know of, but I get the impression that there's more room for individual differentiation in the Japanese system, with maybe overall harder tests with a lower pass threshold. I wish I could read the smaller moon runes under her grade; freeze-framing it didn't help. The first character looks like a squashed ""100,"" maybe, but I think it's just illegible.",anime

In my opinion you are full of shit.  The EU is not finding ways to ban imports from the US.  The companies in the US are refusing to comply with laws because they can make more profit by not doing so and selling domestically.  

EU food standards protect those 510 million people, and the food regulations in my region are even more strict than those mandated by the EU.

Keep thinking it is because they fear competition.  Why do European foodstuffs command such high prices in the US?  

How much does real Parmesan from Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, or parts of Mantua cost?  They have been making this cheese for over 800 years with the same methods.  If anyone was allowed to make Parmesan there would be no way to control quality, or to make sure that people aren't producing sub-par cheese with the name Parmesan.  Most regional delicacies are protected for this reason among others.  

Putting Parmesan into google I get a shop selling their cheapest for $23.27 per kg, and the most expensive selling for $49.11 per kg.

Your asking for my articles and research documents? I can direct you to a few good websites and videos of seminars if you like.  But I was really hoping just to hash it out man to man with what knowledge we both have. I don't like it when people link me to some ridiculously long boring article that neither of us actually understand. It's kind of like passing the buck, I'll do it only by request. 

I watched the video, and ken didn't do a great job answering. But I suppose you can water down my response to 'nothing will change my mind ' but I did say a time machine would do the trick (I'm aware the science is impossible). However, the problem is you're giving me a question that's like saying, what evidence would you need to believe 2+2=3? Well, nothing, because the truth is etched into my heart,  my soul. 


RCD hasn't been found faulty for it's rate of decay? There's no experiment to test it, it requires millions of years. 

I do believe many scientists are pushing an agenda, many of them hate God and spew bile at the thought of intelligent design. But not all,  probably not even half are like that. What I'm saying is most scientists have been taught that creationism is simply impossible and the only choice they have is evolution. So they push it because that's what they were brain washed into. I've heard statistics that say most people who work and research in the field of the sciences believe in a higher power, I hope that's true. 

Humans were designed prefect until we screwed it up with sin. But, regardless, our bodies are incredible machines, way to complex for a series of lucky chances to have mutated us into who we are. Are you familiar with the pocket watch in a field analogy? 

Evolution is a religion, you take it on faith that billions of years have passed, you take it on faith that we spawned from some primordial soup, you believe this because a book told you so. 

Christianity as a whole will never accept evolution into its doctrine because the theory violates God's word, and if God is a liar even one time, then He isn't good and everything else breaks apart. ",AskReddit

13951,"&gt;The court did enforce their ruling.

Only because Khadr came back to Canada. Imagine trying to enforce a similar ruling on actions that happened outside of Canada. I like our Supreme Court. I generally agree with them. However, they have made several rulings in the last few years which are troublesome given that they imply jurisdiction outside of Canada. 

This ruling by the SCOC also creates a problem in that now, 1. if Canada knows a person is being mistreated outside of Canada, and 2. the gov't knows it will be held complicit if they talk to that person; the solution seems to be not to have any contact.

It was beautifully animated and had some interesting plot that kept me going with the series, but the first episode didn't draw me in as much as this one.

This episode introduced a ton of story elements without explaining everything outright, yet I never felt completely lost. On rewatching some scenes and reading people's explanations, I see all the extra details that I missed on the first go around, and see how pretty much every scene had a purpose. And I'm also really enjoying the aesthetic of this show as well. A lot of the backgrounds and scenery is just really well done.

Overall, I'm definitely really curious to see where this show goes.

Also to add on most digital theatres wether its IMAX or not max out at a 4K resolution. 70mm IMAX projections maxes out to to the equivalent of 16-18k. The extra detail is absolutely incredible. 

The issue with watching 70mm print as opposed to an IMAX 70mm print is the cropping. You lose no detail but suddenly you're missing half the image. So personally I would say opt for one of the digital IMAX screens (in which the film is still cropped from IMAX 70mm but not as much) over 70mm because film is a visual language. It depends on your preference. 

Your absolute best viewing experience is 70mm IMAX though
