8,"You are clearly on the shy side. I was too. The problem is that you're expecting other people to go out of their way to include you, but you aren't being proactive and talking to others.

It's uncomfortable, but **the best way to have good friends is to BE a good friend.** You want people in smaller groups to communicate with you, but you never form groups and you never reach out to other people who might be feeling equally ""outsider""ish.

You talk about how you wish people in raids would talk to you, but then you don't, because you'd freeze up. The truth is that this is 100% a comfort-zone issue for you. If you keep acting the same way, you are **going to have the same results**. I'm sure you have taken this shyness to be a character trait that you have and can't change. But the truth is you're more complex than that. Because now we know that you are content with being shy -
 however, your shyness is causing other problems that you aren't content with. These problems you're having will not solve themselves - only you can do that by growing as a person and pushing your comfort zone.

Your options are to try and grow as a person by reaching out to old and new guildies and focus on **being** the friend instead of **having** the friend - or you can look for a smaller group and hope they never get big. I know which one looks better to me.

-----

You consider yourself a person of value, right? And you think you'd be a good friend to someone if they just came along and decided to include you. All you need is someone who is more social to just include you, and you'll just show how valuable you are.

I have a spoiler alert for you - there are a ton of cool, shy people just like that. And the only thing stopping you from being the guy who pieces all these unique awesome friends together is your mental hangup about being social. Push yourself to grow as a gamer and as a person!

11,"&gt; Deserve: These characters are interesting enough to deserve their OWN movies instead of a movie that has to lean on a number of movies.

Even without references to The Avengers, Capt America is a successful stand-alone story. Moreover, Captain America is *literally* its own movie. 

&gt; Parts of the story are simply hijacked, especially in Thor, in order to talk about SHIELD and so on.

You were initially complaining about CA, not Thor. I agree Thor has more SHIELD stuff, but there's less stuff in CA to get irritated about.

&gt; I'd just rather it be cluttered with fleshed out characters.

How are Captain America and Thor not fleshed out? What more would you require of the earlier screenplays? Each of them has a personality, clear-cut values, and most importantly, they ALL undergo character development. Iron Man was the most successful at this, yes, but Thor and CA also succeed as standalone films.",movies

Fate/Zero keeps to that core because it is a direct prequel to Fate/Stay Night. They are the main entries of the series.

Fate/Apoc does not explore that aspect of the series in any way, because it's just a bunch of action. Yes, there are people that watch Fate/Zero and Fate UBW for the fights, but those people aren't really the ones that appreciated and really liked Fate, the ones that are actually invested in the franchise.

Your point that Fate/Apoc is supposed to be appealing to non-Fate fans is the direct opposite of my point. My point is that Fate/Apoc is a terribly entry point because it has little of what most people like about the main series content. It's literally a spin-off that, like I keep repeating, is just trying to be schlock action.

1.  How much of this ""hatred of whites"" do you actually experience in real life as opposed to being something you see in the media, social or otherwise?

2.  Are you actively searching out anti-white content either directly or through participation in online communities which dredge it up for you e.g. /r/tumblrinaction, /r/cringeanarchy, /pol/ etc?

These types of things can give you a seriously warped view on how other people are thinking.  I can tell you that I have a large diverse, socially liberal group of friends, attended a liberal school for four years, and participate in socialist organizing and I have never once had someone directly attack me based on my race/gender.  Still there was a time in my life when I remembered thinking this would be very common mainly because of participation in toxic online communities which encouraged me to think of myself as a victim.

The irony is the mindset you have adopted is actually very similar to that of so-called SJWs.  Adopt a victim mentality and than activelly dredge up things that confirm this bias.  Just like them you are convinced society and major institutions are against you all based on isolated examples which you activelly seek out and just like them you blame whole demographics of people for the toxic actions/words of a few.

I think the movie really shoots itself in the foot with the earlier training sequence with the cafe explosion and the city folding on itself.

Conspiracy related: Our medical system is broken. Symptoms are ""treated"" with pharmaceuticals while most underlying causes *other than obvious traumas or physical anomalies* remain in the dark.


I have spent more than half my life struggling with back and joint issues, and all that severe chronic pain subsequently adds to the mix. I've had enough xrays to heat a hotpocket. I've had (full spine, and main joint) MRIs that show little evidence of physical anomalies. (*Granted, they seemed to be rather low-res broad scans and could be missing something.*)

I have tried increased exercise, diets, supplements, neuro meds, SSRIs, etc. and the *only* thing that has alleviated most of my disabling pain is atypically high doses of opiates. While they allow me to maintain basic physical activities, and provide periods of clear thought to navigate the never ending challenges in my healthcare and plight for subsistence assistance, my life has become a hellish prison.


Sensing that I am likely not the only person facing such challenges, I honestly feel like I and my physicians are missing something. Yet, due to repeated instances of apparent apathy and undeniable condescension by medical personnel, I often wonder if I am being intentionally kept in this state of misery.

The best exemple of Laïcité is when François Hollande (France's former president) had to do his Catholic marriage in secret because as the head of state he could not be seen at a religious ceremony.

Laïcité also adds that religion belongs to the private sphere and you should not display your religion in public. Of course we're not that strict about it so you can walk around with your religious symbols but public ceremonies are too far.",canada

2) Talking to women makes it easier to talk to women. Seeing women as people makes it more likely that women will feel respected by you. This will make it easier for you to approach strange women that you find attractive, and more likely that those women will respond well to you.
3) Getting to know women on a platonic level will help you understand some aspects of the female perspective, which will help you understand what women find attractive and why. It will also mean that you have female wingmen, and women are the best wingmen.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/096f67bb131141f486b55a3679ac94a5.png)  

&gt; Hailing from Austin, Texas, the members of 13th Floor Elevators were one of the first artists to describe their music as psychedelic. Their lyrics and sleeve notes openly and religiously endorsed the use of drugs (particularly LSD) to alter human consciousness for the better. 

&gt; The band rattled to the middle of the Hot 100 in 1966 with You're Gonna Miss Me, anchored by Roky Erickson's unforgettable yelping vocals, Stacy Sutherland's guitar, and Tommy Hall's electric jug runs. According to myth, Tommy's jug was tuned by the amount of marijuana stored in it.

&gt; The group pioneered some of the first garage psychedelia on its albums The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators 1966, and the followup Easter Everywhere 1967. 

&gt; However, Texas at that time was an extremely conservative area that still hadn't come to terms with 50's rock 'n' roll. The authorities and the police set out to bust the entire band for pot (and—not surprisingly—succeeded).

&gt; Stacy Sutherland was jailed. To avoid a prison term, Roky pleaded insanity—a misguided ploy that landed him in Rusk State Hospital for the criminally insane for 3 years. That turn of events spelled the end of the band, although there was a posthumous 1968 LP, Bull of the Woods. 

&gt; Roky Erickson was released from hospital in 1973 and embarked upon a successful solo career that resulted in a CBS album produced by Stu Cook from Creedence Clearwater Revival. During the 1980s he struggled with mental illness and withdrew from public life for many years. However, in the 2000s he has re-emerged with one of his late 70s/early 80s backing bands, The Explosives, playing regular gigs including the Austin City Limits festival in September 2005, as well as Coachella in California, the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and Montreal World Film festival in Canada.

Si juzgamos por lo q dice la COnstitución (un texto ampliamente reconocido como ambiguo por básicamente toda la academia jurídica española), Cataluña y otras muchas regiones son ""naciones"".

But that doesn't mean the background things are running properly / configured properly for everybody. Each player has their own SSD's meaning a certain players SSD might have not have been configured probably. Also just because everything is there doesn't mean it's running properly, look at Shroud with his NVIDIA. It crashed and it caused his PC to lag but it didn't happen of every other computer.

247,"The Wild and their goalies. A while back the Wild had a really old guy named Backstrom who recently went through stomach surgery, they had a rookie goalie in Kuemper, they picked up Bryzgalov when he finally got away from the shit show that was Philly, and they had a guy named Harding who was diagnosed with MS.

So the season ended and Bryz was in love with Minnesota. Like, Philly completely beat him down mentally and emotionally. You can go back and watch his interviews go from ""why you heff to be mad"" infectious happiness to [this](https://youtu.be/D89lN28MoGs)... so when he finally played for a team that didn't hang him out to dry and played in a city where people weren't accusing him of insane shit just to hear his accent he remembered why he loved hockey again. So the season ends and he's basically begging to go back to Minnesota and is saying in the media he will take a really cheap contract to do it. Meanwhile Darcy Kuemper is a rookie goalie who played like 17 games in the season and part of the first round of playoffs and his ELC contract was up. He basically had no career to speak of and absolutely no ground to stand on but he decided to play hardball. So instead of retaining his RFA rights and bringing Bryz back, they left Bryz out in the cold and signed Kuemper to a one way contract while they were at the bleeding edge of the salary cap. This whole sequence was baffling because they still had Harding who has a degenerative incurable disease and Backstrom who is fucking old in relation to planet Earth. So they bring back the rookie who has no guarantee on working out and they don't buyout either of the guys who are guaranteed to be on LTIR at some point.

This sounds like a recipe for failure, and it was, but holy fuck balls if you tried to say anything cautious about it. The Wild had a fierce downvote brigade that would hone in on any goalie discussion and fucking bury you for suggesting it's not a good idea to have two guys who are falling apart in your 3 headed goalie tandem. You would get your inbox bombed about what a moron you are for not understanding that, for the 8 and a half games a year when he's healthy, Harding was the second coming of Hasek. Or you're an idiot for not recognizing Kuemper is the future of the Wilds net and he will probably get his number retired by the time he leaves Minnesota. You also got the combined might of Wild fans and Philly fans talking shit to you if you suggest that maybe they should bring back the veteran goalie who is a known quantity and played well for them. Bryz was the reason the Flyers and the Wild both failed to win the Cup as far as anyone was concerned. Fuck his decent stats and solid play. The only place anyone would budge was admitting the stitched together Frankenstein corpse of Backstrom was probably done at the end of the year but nobody would admit he needed to be off the roster. 

All in all it was a super shitty time and is the sole reason I hate Wild fans and give zero fucks about their team ever experiencing success. ",hockey

Having said that, your primary rotation for BM is to apply Serpent Sting first and hit a few Arcane Shots until your pet is at the mob. Then hit Kill Command, and either two or three Cobra Shots to build your focus bar back up. At this point, you won't need to reapply Serpent Sting because it is refreshed by CS, so your rotation from this point is ~~Attack~~ Kill Command, Arcane to dump focus, and CS to rebuild. Once the mob is below 20 percent health, you can use Kill Shot, and if you're glyphed for it, go ahead and use the freebie second Kill Shot.

If you're sticking with BM, change your rotation slightly (and this will lower your DPS) to avoid using ~~Attack~~ Kill Command if you are grouped with a Bear or Warrior tank, as your pet will continually rip aggro off even the best of them. DKs and Pallys tend to be better at maintaining threat on multiple targets, so you're safer pushing for deeps behind them.

I'd strongly advise you double spec into either SV or MM, as those are simply more viable for end-game content, with MM being the preferred spec at the moment.",wow

They have a Pharah that's being a pain you need a hitscan.

They have a Genji that's an utter pain you need something that can't be deflected.

They have a Tracer, you need a stun, AOE, or something that auto aims. 

They have a Winston that keeps jumping your healers - you need something that can do a lot of damage. 

They have a Symmetra you need to quickly kill her before she turns into a 120dps microwave of doom. 


Mercy, well here you have to single her out and kill her and then the rest of the team. If she has the time to respawn, run back from spawn, and rez that means that your team did fuck all during that time either because your healers died, your tanks where shit, or you have too little damage going forward. With enough control you can re-wipe the whole team after she resurrects them. 

Yes it is one of the most game-changing ults but a lot of them can completely flip a game upside down if used right. Lets be honest, how many times do you get huge rezes (4-5), at about idk 100 hours total as Mercy I pulled off one 5, and about five 4s, then innumerable 3s and 2

If the Sunday Times really was hiring detectives to tap the phones of anyone, that's truly atrocious, and how could Murdoch possibly not know about such a thing? It seems as if tapping the phones of the royal family would cost quite a lot. And, if Murdoch created a corporate culture such that employees wouldn't tell him about doing such a thing on a regular, expensive basis, then, at a corporate level, maybe his management problems are even more of a problem than the eavesdropping.

See, that's the problem I think. What are those guys doing? Hitting on random girls just because they like the form of their boobs? Of course I was encouraging these situations, of course we talked and we both sent subtle signal that we were interested, *that's how it should work*. 

And I'm sure I've missed a lot of opportunities too, specially in the last year since I decided to stay single. But I feel they accumulate and open doors to *better* opportunities. I have a majority of girl friends that I could hit on, but I don't. And I think this kinda leave a scent, you know? That other girls pick up. Anyway, it's known that ignoring girls gets them interested, so there's that and being mysterious and everything. I don't know, you pick up a hobby or two, focus on that, and tada. 

I started a class in CAD (drafting) this winter and I was the only guy who didn't hit on the three girls in the class (eastern European architects, that took a bit of effort I admit).

761,"I've thought about that a lot the past year. People telling you that usually haven't had to worry about living paycheck to paycheck.

Im a young college graduate and throughout college I worked full time and had to pay the bills off a a barely liveable wage but made it work with food stamps /budgeting /never spending and the past year my quality of life has exponentially increased, no *leapt* because I've gotten a couple dollar raise, and then even more than that, in the union job I work.

 I never have to think about living paycheck to paycheck anymore, I have savings, I can go to the dentist and doctor whenever I want, buy food not on sale (though I still tend to), and make random purchases whenever I want. The past couple months after I graduated I've been delving into my hobbies and am just excited about life in general like never before, because I have so much time to think about what I want and CAN do. This is from a lot of things but the root of it is having a wage where I don't have to constantly plan my life around living paycheck to paycheck. 

It's really astounding and it's not like I'm rich or anything by any means. But the quality of my life and who I feel like as a person is completely different because I don't have that constant stress fog hanging around me of ""can I afford this?"", ""will this leave enough for next week?"" etc etc. And also having the safety of mind knowing I have savings for emergencies and also having the ability to help my friends and family out when they need it.

This change has really opened my eyes since I thought I had experienced what my financial life would entail as an adult for my future from the past 4 years: Constant stress, sacrificing opportunities or quality products due to price, and overall just worrying and constantly planning. It makes me frustrated at the way our system is made because I feel extremely lucky to be in my position (although I have worked my ass off every minute to get here) where I can make an affordable wage and there are so many people out there that deserve the same, and more, and have been met with road blocks by our system. 

Anyway, this topic is really close to heart for me as I watched my parents work their ass off my whole life and barely get anywhere and being here now is really important to me, and graduating too since no one has done that in my family. I just hate our system. It's fucked. We all deserve a livable wage, whatever that is I don't know. I have just been obsessed with thinking what kind of people we'd all be when we can actively pursue our interests and hobbies, buy that new TV or kayak we want, and plan for emergencies and afford gifts for our families without constantly stressing about it. We'd all be a lot more whole. 

Edit: I should add my job isn't even what I got my degree in yet and I'm still living in a tiny ass apartment. When I land a job in my field I'll be making a lot more. Tbh Ive worked at a grocery store the past 2 years. ",funny

For example, that recent headline about the boy Pope Francis offered a Vatican passport to. That's generous of him, but if the child is on life support, God already decided the child's end. Expecting a miracle in that context is essentially testing God, and more a product of human frailty than moral durability.

886,"&gt;OK, here is the issue: FGM can't be justified by Islam.

Yes it can, in some interpretations as I've shown numerous times now in previous replies. 

&gt;but only moral viewpoint of some scholars.

Indeed, I agree a viewpoint whom some scholars justify via the hadiths as can be seen in the links you don't seem to have visited...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;That's not Islam. 

 Perhaps not true Islam - whatever that is. I've already made clear numerous times now, that Islam varies in it's interpretations and that rival sects and interpretations often self proclaim themselves as ""true Islam"".

&gt;OK, again, Islam is about Koran and for some hadith. If there is no such a source in those, there is no connection to Islam. Islam isn't something you have additional sources, or holy persons like Christianity, and Islam doesn't have a church. 

&gt;Problem is, **they're not cherrypicking.**

You cant cheery pick you say... but...

&gt;**only thing you can cherrypick** from is Koran, which is forbidden but why not, and hadith maybe. Rest are interpritations, and it's not the religion. You can't cherrypick religious aspects, if things you're picking aren't religious aspects but rather interpretations, on in this case some moral advises.

You seem confused and obtuse. I've already stated numerous times now, that I have not claimed FGM is a religious belief present in the Qur'an and that Islam varies in it's interpretations and sects, all differing on certain matters like FGM. And that not all Muslims are religious and/or follow every demand of their religion/interpretation of - this is what I meant by ""cherry picking"", you could call it ""ignoring aspects of their religion/interpretation of""; for example fajr prayer - not all Muslims seem to practice that. 

&gt;Some scholar saying something isn't different than some fool of the village saying something. Both aren't related to Islam, if there are no relations to Koran or hadith. 

I think I've already shown FGM has links to certain interpretations of Islam, with the justifications arising from primarily the hadiths...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

&gt;Therefore, no justifications by Islam. 

FFS, Yes there are justifications in some interpretations of Islam...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;Unless if you can show me a verse or some hadith about it, while hadiths are also meh, but still.

I've directed you numerous times to you Islamic literature you seem to have overlooked where they utilise the hadiths as there justifications for FGM.

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;while hadiths are also meh, but still.

It doesn't matter what you think about the hadiths, particularly for someone who says he isn't a Muslim. What matters are those Muslims who use hadiths to create rulings on matters in the life of a Muslim, particularly those Muslims who practice FGM. Unfortunately though Quranists who ditch hadiths could help form a more progressive interpretation of Islam prohibiting FGM, they're a minority in the Muslim world though. 


&gt;mate don't get me wrong, but you can't understand things with the way different paradigms from other religions, or just by reading 2 books or papers on a subject but don't know even how things do work. You clearly don't. You don't even know, what's Islam, what's inside the core or tied to religion, what scholars are, what branches are, etc. I mean I can see that you don't even know how religion or branches work, like you assume being Shafi or Shia or Hanefi is something like being Orthodox or Catholic. It's pretty impossible to argue with somebody who doesn't know the basics of the stuff he is talking about. Things you're claiming isn't less absurd than claiming, I don't know some art teacher claiming red is a cold colour, and saying colour theory has this inside its core? Anyway, if you're into claiming things about a religion that you don't have any idea about, I suggest you to learn how it works and how mentality of that belief is, without going with weird assumptions or take outs. 

Now you seem overly butthurt, making strange claims in regards to colour, a seeming fallacious allusion that I'm a European Christian or Jew (when in fact as can be seen from past posts of mine, I'm an apostate or Murtad) and further fallacious claims that I'm seemingly that ignorant of Islam's various sects/branches/interpretations, claims of Muslim scholars, hadiths and the Qur'an and the differing religiosity, culture, priorities and interpretations amongst Muslims etc, all despite my previous comments stressing numerous times of the various interpretations of Islam's various sects/branches/interpretations, claims of Muslim scholars, hadiths and the Qur'an and the differing religiosity, culture, priorities and interpretations amongst Muslims etc.

If anything, you've showed yourself I'm afraid to be overly pedantic, obtuse and confused. 

That said, this conversation with you is really tiring now, in addition if your argument is Islam (and it's various interpretations) has no link to FGM, despite the contrary, then good day to you. ",europe

&gt; Reverend Albert Green (born April 13 1946 in Forrest City, Arkansas) is an American Grammy award winning soul and gospel singer who enjoyed great popularity in the 70s with hit singles such as ""Let's Stay Together"", Tired of Being Alone"", and ""You Oughta Be With Me"". Green has boasted a voice capable of both fluid high streams of sugar and deep south growls and rasps. He has sold over 20 million records worldwide, and he was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, being referred to as ""one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music.""

&gt; Green was born in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He started performing at age ten in a Forrest City quartet called the Greene Brothers; he dropped the final ""E"" from his last name years later as a solo artist. They toured extensively in the mid-1950s in the South until the Greenes moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when they began to tour around Michigan. His father kicked him out of the group because he caught Green listening to Jackie Wilson.

&gt; In 1967 at the age of 16, Al formed an R&amp;B group, Al Green &amp; the Creations, with several of his high-school friends. Two Creation members, Curtis Rogers and Palmer James, founded their own independent record company, Hot Line Music Journal, and had the group record for the label. By that time, the Creations had been re-named the Soul Mates. The group's first single, ""Back Up Train,"" became a surprise hit, climbing to number five on the R&amp;B charts early in 1968. The Soul Mates attempted to record another hit, but all of their subsequent singles failed to find an audience. In 1969, Al Green met bandleader and Hi Records vice president Willie Mitchell while on tour in Midland, Texas. Impressed with Green's voice, he signed the singer to Hi Records, and began collaborating with Al on his debut album

&gt; He was perhaps the ideal complement to the orchestral, syrupy, strong soul production work of Hi Records wizard Willie Mitchell, who also helmed 70s classics for Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles, and himself.

&gt; On October 18, 1974, Mary Woodson, a woman who was his longtime girlfriend, threw a large pot of sticky boiling grits on him as he was preparing to shower, because he didn't want to get married. She committed suicide in minutes, which deeply affected Green to turn to God and religion. This assault from behind caused third-degree burns on his back, stomach and arm. Deeply shaken, Green continued to reaffirm and grow closer to his deeply held love for God, and became an ordained pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis in 1976. 
Continuing to record R&amp;B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. 1977's The Belle Album was critically acclaimed but did not regain his former mass audience. In 1979 Green injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and interpreted this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and gospel singing, also appearing in 1982 with Patti Labelle in the Broadway musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. According to Glide Magazine, ""by the late 70s, he had begun concentrating almost exclusively on gospel music."" His first gospel album was The Lord Will Make a Way. From 1981 to 1989 Green recorded a series of gospel recordings, garnering eight ""soul gospel performance"" Grammys in that period. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with Angelo Earl for He Is the Light, his first album for A&amp;M Records. In 1984, director Robert Mugge released a documentary film, Gospel According to Al Green, including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1989, Green released ""I Get Joy"", again with producer/guitarist Angelo Earl. In 2001, he appeared in the movie and soundtrack of On the Line featuring Lance Bass.

&gt; After spending several years exclusively performing gospel, Green began to return to Rhythm &amp; Blues. First, he released a duet with Annie Lennox, ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"" for Scrooged, a 1988 Bill Murray film. In 1989 Green worked with producer Arthur Baker writing and producing the international hit ""The Message Is Love"". In 1991 he created the introductory theme song for the short-lived television series Good Sports featuring Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett. In 1992, Green recorded again with Baker, the Fine Young Cannibals, and reunited with his former Memphis mix engineer (this time functioning as producer) Terry Manning, to release the album Don't Look Back. His 1994 duet with country music singer Lyle Lovett blended country with R&amp;B, garnering him his ninth Grammy, this time in a pop music category. Green's first secular album in some time was Your Heart's In Good Hands (1995), released to positive reviews but disappointing sales, the same year Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In 2000, Green published Take Me to the River, a book discussing his career. Green received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.
In 2001, Green's live cover of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" was released on the soundtrack to Will Smith's film Ali (the song plays when Muhammad Ali learns of the death of close friend Malcolm X).
By 2003 Green released a non-religious (secular) album entitled I Can't Stop, his first collaboration with Willie Mitchell since 1985's He is the Light. In March 2005 he issued Everything's OK as the follow-up to I Can't Stop. Green also collaborated with Mitchell on this secular CD.

&gt; The title of Al Green's latest album Lay It Down released May, 2008, truly tells it like it is. Conceived as a collaboration between the soul legend and a handful of gifted young admirers from the worlds of contemporary R&amp;B and hip hop, the album is drawn from a series of inspired sessions that yielded the most high-spirited, funky and often lushly romantic songs of Green's latter-day career.

&gt; The project features the sophisticated R&amp;B voices of singer-songwriters John Legend, Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae, and it was co-produced with Green by two of hip-hop's most innovative players, drummer Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson from the Roots and keyboardist  James Poyser , the go-to guy for high-profile artists ranging from Erykah Badu to Common. Add in Brooklyn's celebrated  Dap-King Horns (Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse), guitarist Chalmers ""Spanky"" Alford (Mighty Clouds of Joy, Joss Stone) and bassist Adam Blackstone (Jill Scott, DJ Jazzy Jeff), among others, and you've got a modern soul-music dream team, fronted by the most expressive voice in the business.

1027,"I know you just hit 85, so you probably aren't going to level an alt soon, but let me make a suggestion for the next one, as I level a ton of toons. It looks like you are about 5-10 quests into Twilight Highlands, which means you were 84 in Uldum for a long time. 80-85 goes much more quickly if you use the level-appropriate zone as SOON as it is available, rather than finishing off each zone before moving to the next, which is what I assume you did. Hyjal and Vashj'ir are parallel to one another, so you can choose either one for 80-82 (I choose Hyjal because I like it better), and if you choose Hyjal, you can actually finish the whole zone, even though you will hit 82 a while before finishing it. The reason in this case is because the last portion of Hyjals quests are not only very entertaining, but quite experience-efficient. So I usually do every quest in Hyjal, which gets me within a few bars of level 83. Then I go to Deepholm (82-83) until level 83, and as SOON as I ding, I move to Uldum (83-84) until hitting 84, and again, as SOON as I ding, I move to Twilight Highlands until 85. The difference in experience-rate of these zones is great enough that it is much quicker to move along as soon as you ding.

i know there is some bias here but the cubs' roster is very similar to last year's, it just took the first half to shake off the effects of last year's postseason (elongated season, shortened off season, myriad of off the field sponsorship commitments, appearances, and distractions that are generally front loaded at the beginning of the season).  

they're finally starting to play up to their potential, and have added quintana who i think will only get better as he builds more confidence as a result of finally getting some run support.  starting rotation is kicking into gear, the bullpen has been very good all season and i hope that continues, and offense taking more quality at bats and scoring runs consistently.

[KissMeHelga](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ini8t/hey_reddit_who_feels_that_reading_lots_of_books/c255jcs) says it succinctly. It merely brings more from the set of unknowns into the set of knowns. What you do with it is then up to you. If you use it honestly to question all your beliefs/conditioning to try and arrive at some ""objective truth"" it is quite empowering whereas if you pick and choose selectively to only bolster your prior unwarranted beliefs it is quite harmful. Thus ""Intelligence"" has to be applied to what is being ""Read"" so that it itself can grow. The key is to actively seek a variety of thoughts and ideas and apply intelligence to get at the heart of things. One should not lose oneself in the mass of data but must always focus on the essence of the thing under consideration. Read until you are able to grasp the essence and then you may choose to go into the details of various aspects. If done properly, there is a growth of Intelligence else it merely leads to Confusion, ""Analysis Paralysis"" and a loss of Confidence in oneself.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

I personally enjoy QP a lot more because rarely do I see people purposely throw or be toxic. That being said, you will see people just be bad at their heroes, myself included. QP is the only time I would pull out of my sick Hanzo skills because I know I won't play it in competitive. ",Overwatch

First you say Brees was better for a short time. This isn't true. Brees has been better than Favre for more than a decade. That is not a short time.

Then you say that Favre should be considered one of the best QBs ever because of longevity and stats. I disagee longevity itself doesnt doesn't make a QB good and Favre's stats are closer to Jay Cutler's than any of the best QBs ever. Your argument would permit Cutler to get in the HOF if he played long enough. That's absurd.

Last, the only significant thing Favre is better than Brees at likability and arm strength. Favre's numbers are closer to Jay Cutler's than Brees, let alone the greatest QBs of all time.

&gt; BEIJING - With flybys of advanced new jets and a mass rally of troops, Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw a large-scale military parade at a remote northern China base on Sunday to mark 90 years since the founding of the People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army.

&gt; Traveling down a long strip lined with tanks, missile launchers and other military vehicles, Xi, wearing military fatigues, greeted thousands of troops.

&gt; Sources with ties to the military say Xi&amp;#039;s announcement to cut 300,000 troops, made at a massive military parade through central Beijing in 2015 to mark 70 years since the end of World War Two, has caused unease within the ranks.

1230,"I think trying to draw in the Rift Rivals performance to how it invalidates the tier list in question is not that strong an argument because you see the tier list came out before Rift Rivals happened when TSM was probably fourth/fifth in standings. They did look really good at Rift Rivals but I'd say that's positive improvement on the team overall.

On another note, synergy with a team is not the same as playing well at your position. Yeah TSM puts a lot of faith in doublelift and because of the team atmosphere it does seem like they mesh well as a team but in Phreak's tier list it's continually contradictory to the idea that team synergy matters. Piglet was third, wasn't he? If we're rating ADCs based on team performance, he's in the shitter. Arrow at the time would also be in the shitter but if this were true people would be complaining about Arrow's abysmal placing. *Keith* and *LOD*, the two bottom ADCs in the tier list, would both be better than Apollo.

I'm not arguing that you're wrong in terms of DL's value, I'm far from a pro analyst, and there could be things at Rift Rivals that I wasn't seeing, but that doesn't make Rift Rivals an appropriate basis for argument on the tier list.",leagueoflegends

1244," Beyonce is a performance artist and singer. She has never alluded to otherwise. It takes talent and hard work to sing, dance, and perform the way she does - other wise a lot more people would do it and she wouldn't be paid millions to do so. 

Those people who credit Beyonce for the whole song are making assumptions by their own volition. The people who write and produce the songs for Beyonce know full well they don't get the full prestige of credit but they get credit in other ways such as money contracts to produce for other performers.

 If nobody performed their work then they wouldn't get paid so they sell it to people who *can* perform the songs. It's a symbiotic relationship. Who would go see a writer go up on stage and read their work even if they don't have the talent of singing? Many producers also D.J so they *can* receive credit for their work that way as well. With the rise of techno/electronica/dubstep etc. this has been a popular way for producers to get famous.

But by and large, people prefer singing and performing to the technical aspects of the production. This applies to everything that has ""face."" Someone designed the McDonald's Arches but you never hear about them? Why don't they get credit for their artwork?

Furthermore, I don't see why you would divorce singing from the concept of art by way of necessitating that everyone who sings *must* also write their songs in order to be considered an artist. 

Led Zeppelin, Elvis, and a lot of other rock 'n' roll musicians blatantly stole their music from blues musicians yet these blues musicians hardly get credited which is admittedly unfair. 

What I'm saying is that people don't care who wrote a dance hit. They just want to dance and sing along which is fine. Writers and producers who otherwise aren't inclined to perform get to be paid for their music and see it performed. Both the performers of the music as well as the designers of it are artists just in different ways that support each other.

It comes off as stupid because we, the audience, knows what she doesn't, and are super hype for a DanyxJon meeting, but from Sansa's POV, all of her resistance comes from trying to protect Jon and keep him alive.

I'm not advocating that having more kids = better, I'm saying that its not as simple as more kids = forever poor. I'm saying that the situations and ideals in the first world don't always translate to the poor of the third world. 

Depending on how far apart you have your kids, then they can share clothing, or have hand-me-downs, or share toys. Plus in a situation where only the well off and richer can get an education, education does become very important. These kids will more than likely value education, knowing that its the only way for them to be able to provide for their families. 

Also, while I agree that getting an education is the best way for them to improve their situation, I don't agree that by dropping out of school they'll end up hardly working or making much money. In a city like that, craftsmen and vocational opportunities are more plentiful than in the US ( i'm using the US as my point of reference, I'm not assuming you're necessarily from the US). It is possible to make a decent living being a craftsman. 

I'm not saying that this lady having 8 kids is going to make their situation better, on the contrary, I think less kids would probably have made life a little easier for them. My point is that its not as simple as that.

The events themselves are fun to watch but the finals are starting to get a bit underwhelming cause you just expect SKT to win. Even in LCK they've been the most dominant team for about three years now.

If I wasn't a TSM fan since season 1 and I didn't build an early connection with them, I'd probably be super bored of TSM winning a lot of splits in NA too. I don't really blame people who aren't TSM fans that want them to lose because they want newer teams to take the throne in NA.",leagueoflegends
1296,"That was her reply exactly. My interpretation was that she feels like she is an experienced leader or at least someone capable of advising a leader while her only experience is being in proximity to Kings and Cersei, and not while they're doing anything related to leading.  

Meanwhile John has been Lord Commander for who knows how long, he convinced a council that lead the free folk to trust him and betray their ways in doing so.  Then he convinced the free folk and several northern houses to fight with him and take Winterfell (with help from Davos, the only thing Sansa did was completely misread Leanna Mormont and insult her as a potential great beauty and insult Lord Glover after his mind was made up, a move Jon visibly knew had 0% chance of working).  

Sansa's only contribution (while obviously not minor) has been the Nights of the Vale.  Even with that aid, she left Jon completely in the dark and she is lucky he didn't get killed again on multiple occasions (Cavalry charge timing, arrows falling around him, crush scene, etc), unless of couse she wanted him to die.  I don't think that's the case I think it's just a good example of how oblivious she is about the impact of her actions. 

TLDR:  My interpretation is that Sansa thinks she's qualified to advise when in reality she has very little practical experience. She may know some nuance about how people like Cersei and Littlefinger work, but in general Jon has much better leadership capabilities from practical experience. ",gameofthrones

1356,"Your first few points (video rooms, charter flights, modern medicine, year-round training, not needing to work in offseason) were points I was trying to make with my assertion that the game is easier to *play*. What is harder now is to stand out, to be a star. Your assertion that today's pitching is diluted is just absolutely ludicrous; we have more pitchers now throwing harder than ever, with filthier stuff. We integrated in 1947 and now MLB is more global than it ever has been; therefore, even though there are more teams, the talent pool is exponentially bigger. And, given the argument that you make (""video rooms, charter flights, modern medicine, year round training staffs, not needing to work in the off-season""), more pitchers today can make themselves extremely good. Before the game was played more on pure ability and talent. Now, the game is much more a skill game, as most if not all the players are extensively physically trained.

The ""Juiced"" era was a direct and logical extension to the ever-evolving training of the players. We had reached a point where training more was not giving the players the gains they wanted, and for those not sufficiently skilled, brute strength gave them an edge. Eventually, star players realized *they* could get even better, and started using, which is what happened with McGwire and Bonds, among others.

Quote:

*The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them from their center.*

What this means in practice is that as the distance between two gravitational bodies increases, the strength of attraction between them drops off precipitiously. To cause any gravitational effects on the Earth, the body would need to be truly massive, or would need to pass extremely close. But if it is a small body, such as a comet, even if it kissed the surface of the Earth it would not be close enough to its center to actually produce any significant gravitational effect (the Earth is 4,000 miles in radius).

For this astronomical body to be a threat, it would need to be MASSIVE, and it would need to pass very close to the Earth. Both. One or the other isn't going to do it.",conspiracy

Long Edit: Seems like the Rose Colored Goggles are the happening mog in this thread. I'll explain, but I'm sure be I'll be told how I'm all wrong.

Group has been together since the end of MoP, and some of us have made 10/10 M EN ToS and NH. 

No, we're not interested in running M+ anymore: the balance is garbage, the affixes aren't fun, and the drops are almost all disenchanted. GRINDING them over and over is sickening at this point. We just want a 15 done. Too bad that extra AP and 930 in the box is almost always useless.

No, we aren't doing WQ or really world anything anymore: The quests are repetitive and boring, OR are useless as most of us sit on 100k+, and the Paragon boxes are garbage that we're tired of GRINDING.

No, we aren't rolling alts anymore either. Besides having to deal with M+ and WQ woes above, you're now playing the leggo lottery! Better hope you get them! Even if you do, enjoy the GRINDING it took just get to a point where you have the proper rotation. Now go get the wrong relics and trinkets for 3mos.

No, we're not organizing PvP: The gear and AP are useless, the honor grind is ridiculous and unrewarding, and it's a retarded melee CC tunnel fest. I mean, people who I've seen heal or cast in PvP for years have got melee alts just for PvP now, because why punish yourself? We don't even talk about arena because so many people are turned off by it.

No, we aren't immersed in the story enough to want to participate: The suramar journey was great, but Legionfall dropped the ball so hard it's like WoD where the main design team had moved on. Feel free to grind there too. Give me a pair of the orange light up cones and I'll wave the sentinax over to the mage tower myself, the whole place is atrocious.

We cleared ToS and nobody feels the need to keep up with the bullshit anymore. People still don't have certain legs, hidden appearances, the fuckin fox mount, rank 3 yadda yadda, faction mounts, or the actually useful relic that only drops from two M+ we've done 200 times each. Truth is, nobody really cares anymore. Hell, we regularly talk about how if the rng actually ever hits for something, we'll be too jaded to even wear/ride it.

For those of us who have it all gear wise, or close enough, where is the game? Getting one shot by crazy overtuned tyrannical bosses? Declining classes until you have the exact group comp to deal with a 17+? So you can get blown up by the other rng affixes? Because the end game m+ scene is not at all mob/boss/affix tuned or class/role balanced. 

It doesn't feel like a game, just spinning my rotation to another rng box, it feels like a chore.     ",wow

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Last year when I was trying to understand the events of Hodor's story in 'Hold the Door,' the only way it made sense is to imagine the entire 8 seasons as a book that has already been written. It's going to play out the way it is supposed to. Bran is someone who can freely flip through the pages and revisit any previous points in the story (as we've seen him do multiple times last season), as well as flip forward and see what's to come before the story actually gets there. 

He was able to visit a younger Hodor and open the gates for him to experience his older self, which fried his mind. What Bran did is very similar to how while reading, sometimes we hold the page we are on with our finger, and flip back to an earlier part of the book. I'm sure Bran can hold the page he's on and also flip forward to see what's coming. That's just how I see it anyway. Open to any discussion as always.

1680,"Because the fact is tech is very much a multiracial place with very good attitudes in regards to race.  Relative to population, Asians are actually overrepresented, but they focus on absolute numbers because the fact that most people in Canada are white lets them paint a misleading picture that tech must be a white boys club.  It would break their minds that their logic would actually point to the conclusion it's an Asian mens club.

If there is a problem in tech, from what I can see, it's widespread misogynist views on women and supremacist views of men.  This is a culture strongly connected to gaming culture, also infamously misogynistic, and a group of people practically stereotyped as being bad with women and having little interaction with the opposite sex. Even so, if tech really fixed all its issues with women, I do not genuinely think there would be a 1:1 ratio of men and women in tech unless you forced both genders to do jobs they did not want to do, as it seems fairly self-evident to me that women are more interested in empathising type jobs and men more in systemising type jobs.  Nonetheless, I believe gender is an issue in tech.  

Race really is not.  It's absolutely a bullshit lie being pushed because somebody cannot help but see the world through an ideological filter.  If you work in the field and you're a racist you will drive yourself goddamned nuts because of the multiracial workforce.  Tech is ALREADY diverse, if diverse means white people aren't working in it, and the only underrepresented groups really are Hispanics, Aborigionals, and Blacks, but of course, that must mean that while everybody else is treated fairly, these three groups must be treated with racism.  It couldn't be in any way connected to some of these groups coming from cultures less tightly connected to computing relative to the three races overwhelmingly over represented on the pacific, the tech hub of the world, while living in cities with good internet access.  That if you truly want a more diverse workforce, you need to stop going after the not racist at all employers, stop blaming them for the problem, and simply promote computers to groups who simply have not had as much experience with them.

I'm not saying any of these because I fear the ""white boys club"" is gonna be broken up, it's that Asians, who are in tech because of interest and merit, are going to be thrown under the bus for the sake of somebodies diversity agenda, because if they're overrepresented they must have done something evil and wrong according to diversity think.  Because in some racists minds, if we don't have equal outcomes, some racial group must have done something evil to undermine peoples equal opportunity, and we must correct for this by discriminating against any racial group that is successful, and we call that ""diversity"" and ""political correctness"".

I wish leaving comms and focusing on your own play could have an impact in the game, but it reduces your chance of winning pretty severely IMO. 

In Dota, you know when a teamfight is coming. It's very clear and it's very important that everyone participates. There's no chance that one of your teammates just wont go to it and use everything they have. Well, there is a chance, but it's much less than in OW where you don't know if your team wants to fight or not. 

In Overwatch, if you're not in comms and you engage in a teamfight with your team and they don't follow up and they back out, it's **your fault.** Not theirs for not using ults. This now means you'll probably be at a big disadvantage for at least a minute and a half.

Now let's assume she gains 50 rank for all 61 wins. I've NEVER seen anyone gain that much, let alone consistently. But sure, 61 wins x 50 rank = 3050.

So that puts her at 4050. But WAIT, she also lost 52% of her games. Well, I don't know how many losses she had cuz it doesn't say. But I can work out it. [Google tells me 48% of 127 is 60.96](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=48%25+of+127&amp;cad=h) so let's say she has 127 games, which would put her at 66 losses. If we assume she loses 10 rank per game, that means a loss of 660, which would put her new rank at 3390.

Hmm now wait a second, something here doesn't add up. I've never seen anyone consistently gain 50 rank, and lose 10 rank, yet even with these horribly exagerrated numbers, your screenshot doesn't add up. Unless it's.....Hold on...Wait, it could be fake?

Look at the top 500 icon. Notice how in both screenshots, the top 500 icons are in the same frame of animation.

So yeah, in summary, show me this guy's overbuff and then I'll believe you. But NOTHING here adds up. Even if you're way below your MMR, I've never seen anyone gain more than 50 per game, let alone consistently. Remember, love with your heart, use your head for everything else.",Overwatch

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2269470207ac4f8eb76511ee93c7c3b7.png)  

&gt; 2 Live Crew (also known as ""The 2 Live Crew"") is a controversial miami bass group, largely known due to the sexual themes of one hip-hop album: 1989's 'As Nasty As They Wanna Be'. It was both certified double platinum by the RIAA as well as subject to an acrimonious legal case. 2 Live Crew formed as three young men in the U.S. Air Force all met each other after they became stationed in Riverside, California in 1984.

&gt; Made up of Fresh Kid Ice (born Chris Wong Won), DJ Mr. Mixx (born David Hobbs), and Amazing V (born Yuri Vielot), the multi-racial rap group released their debut single, ""Revelation"". in 1985. Published through Fresh Beat Records/Macola Records out of Hollywood, California, their track showed the fingerprints of early 80s electronica music. Inspired by records by hip-hop pioneers such as Afrika Bambaataa, they put the group together with the intentions of ""sustaining the 808 kick drum"".

&gt; ""Revelation"" achieved major success in Miami, Florida, where performer Luke Skyywalker (born Luther Campbell) and the Ghetto Style DJ's took interest in 2 Live Crew. The group traveled to Miami to perform at Luke's ""Pac Jam"" teen club, also landing live mix show slots on Steven J Grey's WEDR radio show. In 1985, the group released a new single, called ""What I Like"", on Fresh Beat/Macola.

&gt; Amazing V left the group, and Fresh Kid Ice along with Mr. Mixx moved to Miami, hiring Luke Skyywalker as their manager. In 1986, the act was hired to perform WEDR's Dade County Youth Fair, adding fellow California rapper Brother Marquis, formerly of The Caution Crew, and recorded the opening song to their album live. After realizing their shows lacked stage presence, they decided to add Luke to the group as a stage hypeman. Reacting to the crowd's dirty dancing they saw in Miami, they responded by recording suggestive music, which soon evolved into fully fledged x-rated music.

&gt; Once major labels came to Luke in hopes of recruiting the group away from Luke Skyywalker Records, Luke finally clamped down and had 2 Live Crew sign contracts. Having their own label also meant keeping their tracks free from record company censorship, and 2 Live Crew's raunchy 1986 song ""Throw the D"" managed to sell over 200,000 copies. Luke joined the group completely as a co-vocalist as well.

&gt; On the heels of ""As Nasty as they Wanna Be"", Luke decided to record an album in his own name with the massive aid of 2 Live Crew. When the crew recived a small flat fee for their work on Luke's album rather than receiving royalties, the group secretly broke up over money. Mr. Mixx moved to Oakland forming T-Shirt &amp; Khakis Productions, and Brother Marquis moved to Atlanta forming the group 2 Nazty; however, Luke convinced them to record one more album. During the recording process, sample clearances became an issue, making the record less than their expectations. The crew remained broken up, suing Luke for back royalties. Fresh Kid Ice backed out of the suit, remained with Luke Records, and reformed as ""The New 2 Live Crew"" for one album.

&gt; Finally, he too left Luke and the three core members regrouped signing with Luke's former business associate Lil Joe Weinstein, but the album was not marketed well. The filmakers behind the film ""Friday"" contacted Luke for a new 2 Live Crew song for the soundtrack not knowing the group had broken up. Luke convinced them to regroup under Luke's tutelage again for one song, but that was the last time all four members would work together. Since then, various members have recorded and toured as 2 Live Crew, licensing the name from Lil Joe Weinstein Read more on Last.fm.

Also, I don't agree that education, social cohesion and hard work alone are enough. The way many nations are set up, those in power stay in power any means necessary and are often leveraged against the poor, hard working peoples. The situation in 1st world nations is definitely not as lopsided and unfair as it is in many 3rd world nations, but people in many nations needs a fairer shake in terms of getting a good life if they work hard on it.

1961,"I thought this was a pretty good episode with some really interesting themes running throughout. 

What was particularly interesting was seeing the subtle hints about a divide in between Cersei and Jaime. We see him claim that he is loyal to Cersei and that he backs her up, but does he fully do so in his heart? Cersei took great delight in killing Tyene in as cruel a way as possible. Jaime on the other hand chose to kill Olenna as compassionately as he could, without taunting her. Even when he found out at the last minute that Olenna had conspired to kill Joffrey, he still allowed her that peaceful death - leaving the room instead of being violent at the last moment. It shows how they respond differently and think differently.  

I wonder how much of an impact Olenna's comments will have on him in the long run? 

EDIT: I just recalled another difference between Cersei and Jaime. Jaime admits he cares about Casterly Rock, Cersei doesn't. What does this say about them, has Cersei moved on in a way that Jaime hasn't?

Another interesting comparison was between Cersei and Olenna. When Cersei was torturing the Sand Snakes she mentioned how she struggled to sleep at night. Olenna on the other hand said that she never had trouble sleeping no matter what she did because she believed she was right. Does this hint at Olenna being a mentally stronger person then Cersei? Does it mean that Olenna's actions had some moral justification whereas Cersei's are beyond the pale? Or that Cersei will eventually snap under the weight of ruling.  

It was also fascinating to see the difference between Sam's bravery and compassion for Jorah, in an episode filled with cruelty and violence. It does show that compassion can have a value in Westeros. Also, did anyone think that copying out manuscripts was definitely not a punishment? I would have loved doing that! 

Now we know the value of the advice Olenna gave Dany in the previous episode. Dany's instinct was to seek out Euron's fleet with her dragons and destroy it. She was talked out of it by her advisors and that reining in of her dragon instinct cost her dearly, taking out the remains of her fleet and a much needed ally, ironically ending the life of the woman who gave her the advice. 

It's going to be interesting to see how the situation between Dany and Jon plays out. The scene in which their various titles were read out could not have made the difference between their leadership styles and views on the world clearer. Jon, for all his humbleness, demonstrated that he has a much better grip on affairs in Westeros then Dany. Jon walked away from the negotiations with everything he wanted. Dany failed in her goals to get Jon to bend the knee, at least for now. In fact Dany has had nothing but failures since landing at Dragon Stone. 

We saw Cersei compared with Tywin in several ways, both in Cersei's conversation with the representative of the Iron Bank, and when Tyrion was discussing her with the others. So far Cersei's choices have appeared to be good ones, but at what cost? There is a reason Tywin didn't just take Highgarden when he needed money, he knew the cost of doing so would be too high. Tywin's ruthlessness against his own family eventually cost him his life, Tyrion wouldn't be where he is now if Tywin had not done that. Where will Cersei's ruthlessness eventually take her? 

We also got to see Sansa's leadership style contrasted with Jons. I felt this scene was slightly clumsy which was a shame, seeing her suggest adaptations to the armour felt a bit silly. Surely the armourers would have thought of that. Anyway it was still enlightening, Sansa seemed to take to command much more naturally and was more comfortable with giving orders then Jon is. Jon always seems reluctant and even admitted in his conversation with Dany that he doesn't enjoy being a leader. Sansa on the other hand seemed to relish it. Will she feel differently when she has to live with the consequences of her decisions and their effects on others - for good or ill?

For instance, in my opinion the best song by the Beatles is Golden Slumbers + Carry That Weight + The End. They're not really obscure, but on that album if someone asks you to name a song, most people will say 'Here Comes The Sun', 'Something' or 'Come Together'.

There's different things you can do to contribute to your team beyond healing. Call out flankers, stay alive instead of dying to flankers often, manage your own ults well, track enemy ults for your team and call them out before they might happen, and so on. General game sense is very valuable in overwatch and will win you games no matter what role. 

You can also try flexing to other categories. When you already have two good supports on your team or even just one other support but you really need a tank or dps, flexing is very valuable. In overwatch, countering enemy heroes is very strong - you can turn a game by switching to pharah when they don't have hitscan just because they can't do anything.

2041,"My first season of C League a guy on ky team got a hot trick. As you'd imagine in C league they were all garbage goals so we didn't know it was a hat trick until he told us. But he was the ""captain"" (he brought the pucks and the jerseys were his) and he was a nice guy and terrible player so we were excited for him. 

We start freaking out and one guy tossed his helmet on the ice. The ref, a real Napoleon type, gave him two minutes for delay of game and I think another penalty for incomplete equipment or some other bullshit. It was definitely a double-minor, I know that.  We argue our case, as eloquently and kindly as you'd expect, get at least one more bench minor and make zero headway in our queries about the romantic and sexual availabilities of the refs mother. 

This was with about 5 minutes to go in the third and we were down 9-5 so we were in total ""fuck it"" mode. 

So we collude on the bench. We make sure the guy with the hatty is on the ice when the game ends. The minute the buzzer sounds the guy on the far end of the box chucks his helmet as far as he can onto the ice. Then the guy at the near end chucks his. From there our helmets fly one after another onto the ice, alternating ends of the bench. The ref is screaming and blowing his whistle, gesticulating wildly and the only word he can enunciate is ""suspension."" 

We ignore him entirely, mob our teammate the triple goal scorer, and head through the handshake line. While we congratulate the other team on their victory, they congratulate us on our display of exuberant celebration and ref-baiting. 

And that is the only time (so far) I've doffed my headwear in recongition of a hat trick.

Epilogue: the league was going to uphold our suspension, but our opponent the next week was so furious about having their game cancelled they demanded we be able to play, or that the league reimburse the percentage of the league fee they were losing. The rink caved and we played. Napoleon was not our ref for the rest of the season. Not sure if that was his choice or not. ",hockey

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

2279,"Been awhile since I read the book, so may not be 100% on the details, forgive me.

SPOILERS if you haven't read/seen Inferno.

The characters spend the story tracking down this contagion that a mad scientist is trying to unleash on the world as a population control measure.  Mystery ensues, blah blah blah, we get to the end; they figure the location where the bad guy is releasing this contagion and make their way there.  The dude put a gallon of this virus/bacteria/whatever into a dissolving plastic bag in an underground cistern.  He videotapes this bag that is set to dissolve and release the toxin in a week (or whatever), infecting humanity, etc etc.  

In the book, they find the location supposedly just in time to prevent the bag bursting.  Tension builds as they look for it, and finally they do. The twist is that they found just an empty bag; the contagion had already been released and infecting people (unknown to anyone) for days. The end result is that the infection spreads around the world, and makes 1/3 of humans infertile (rather than outright killing people); thus accomplishing the scientist's goal of reducing the population.  It was a great if somewhat dark ending to the book.

In the movie however, they Hollywood-ize it to where it doesn't even make the same point (that overpopulation is actually a bad thing, the 'mad' scientist guy was right).  They arrive to find the bag still intact (of course), and contain it (of course), thus saving humanity (of course) from just another insane mass murderer.  Completely missing the point.

If you ever saw 'I am Legend' (Will Smith with dog and zombies, 2007-ish), it had a similar so-called ""controversial"" alternate ending to the movie that humanized the zombies and made an interesting ending.  This was removed from the final version (of course), instead showing the zombies as vile evil monsters (of course), and the survivors escaping and saving humanity (of course).

2465,"The single currency meant that Greek bonds were just as good as German ones thanks to disappearance of the foreign exchange risk, therefore a massive flow of capital originating mainly from German and French banks flooded Greece in search for better yields, overheating the Greek economy, i.e. increasing its inflation rate.

As a result of the 2007 crisis, the flow came to a halt and reversed course (a *sudden stop* occurred), and in 2010 the redenomination risk (i.e. the possibility of returning to national currencies) that emerged precipitated the European economic crisis. Since then, money granted to Greece has actually been used to repay debts it held *vis-à-vis* French and German banks.

In other words, European taxpayers' money rescued German and French banks that engaged in irresponsible lending (an irresponsible loan implies an irresponsible lender, and actually banks are much better equipped than businesses &amp; households to assess risk, both micro and macro).

As a side note, Italy, whose banks were not involved in the lending spree in Greece, had to give away at least €65 bln directly through the ESM which essentially was a bailout for German and French banks. This is very laughable.

In short, German and French banks were and are still being bailout out indirectly through the bailouts granted to Greece financed with European taxpayers' money. In normal conditions Greece would've defaulted, but Trichet (then ECB president) said ""no!"" and since then the damage of this eurocharade has only increased (actually, without the euro there would haven't been any bubble in the first place).

Had Greece defaulted then, the burden would've fallen on German and French banks, but now it is European taxpayers who would incur the losses after this ""swap"" managed by the Troika. That's why a default/restructuring/haircut is systematically ruled out even though it is necessary, as made clear by the IMF.

Spain experienced the same, but at a smaller scale and mainly in its real estate market. Actually, up until 2007 its finances were rock solid (like Ireland's) and it [did everything right](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/07/15/2168347/if-spain-didnt-need-capital-controls-why-would-anyone/).

You don't switch compositions, what it comes down to 9/10 is mechanical skill and only mechanical skill if your team members are all on it and there are no throwers (so in your 6 person team format or in professionals).

Spurs get first overall pick in Duncan when they already have David Robinson. They two late draft picks in Parker and Manu turn into all-stars. And then Kawhi, mid-first round pick that they traded an established player for (Hill) and had no idea how good he would become (Spurs FO and Pop have admitted as much).

Warriors draft a mid-lottery, late-lottery, and second round pick who become perennial MVP candidates, all-NBA and one of the best shooters of all time, and perennial DPOY.  And all in a time frame where they can play together (vs say when Toronto had Vince and then drafted Bosh).

OKC had three top 4 picks in four years (Durant, Westbrook, Harden) and a late first in Ibaka. Three MVP candidates and a former first team all-defensive player and league blocks leader.

Jazz....really? Included with the above? 

Houston is the other one. Timing of Harden extension, one of the few teams with the cap situation and assets able to make the trade at the time, and Harden turning into a better player than anyone expected, MVP candidate.

What's the pattern? A top picks who turns into an MVP calibre player as expected (Duncan, Durant) or a later pick who surprisingly turns into an MVP calibre player (Curry, Kawhi, Westbrook, Harden).

Only watch the Director's Cut. Like many of Ridley Scott's films, there are a number of versions. The theatrical release was criticized for not making sense, and Scott blamed the studio suits for screwing up the editing. It was re-edited and the Director's Cut is a completely different film. A good one.

Second, I think the movie is a solid depiction of 12th century politics, religion and social strata. In that context, I think some of the characters' motivation doesn't make a lot of sense, and the movie's box office suffered for it. It's because they're acting on 12th century ideas, not ours.

Moreover, all of the examples provided by the OED concern humans: ‘No one infantilizes adults more than the conservatives and the extreme right'.

The MW definition is far less clear and offers no examples. What is does do is connect the word to the the word 'infantile', which is obvious, but tells us nothing. 

Finally, if we google 'infantilize the debate' we get a total of 5 results. Of these 3 are comments by users and 2 are from the same article reproduced on two different websites. This is consistent with the incorrect usage of a term.

I'm all for the flexible usage of language. However, if we want to retain language as an effective tool of communication, there have to be limits. My argument here is in fact not that the author doesn't use a human object to the verb. 'Infantilise' is a very aggressive term. It implies a removal of control, not simply the distortion of one's arguments. A man might infantilise his wife if he talks down to her as if her opinions have the intellectual value of a child's. Similarly, we might infantilise a nation if we assert that they cannot survive without their colonial oppresors. But the Economist is not asserting that the Germans are immature and need a grown-up to take charge. They simply disagree with the German perspective on trade surpluses and, at worst, are a bit dismissive of the arguments that support that perspective.

2718,"&gt; a textbook example as to why we have the electoral colleg

You're *very* confused.

The purpose of the electoral college was a compromise between *just* the Congress appointing a President and *just* the population voting one in. Congress essentially agreed to it on the specific idea that the EC would *stop* populist Presidents from being elected.

With that, you have a situation where a distinct *minority* of voters have *INFLATED* vote value. Not all votes are equal, period. A rural voter in Iowa doesn't just get proportional votes by population, but two EXTRA votes (similar to the SEnate), except these aren't separated in power from their by-population vote, meaning that a voter in Iowa's votes are worth THREE TIMES what a voter in California's was... also, it's a bit disingenuous to say it was Cali's fault, as if no one else voted for him, that it came in ""at the end"" is what makes it look like that, but that's like saying NY doesn't exist.

In effect, the Electoral College *must* be scrapped, or *must* have two sides to it which must agree (split the 435 by population and the 100 which give 2 each... otherwise you're just unfairly bolstering rural citizens). 

**We can't pretend it's even *representative* democracy if the citizens votes aren't equal to each other.**

**The problem is that rural states now have disproportionate control of the country, which is just as much of a problem as urban cities having disproportionate control. Simply put, the founding fathers could not have forseen the kind of population we have, nor the capacity for cities to be *so* big and centralized.**",worldnews

Not just based on his music but what he's done to give back to the Chicago community and his political stances he's taken. He's taking the power he truly has in his position and using it to make a difference. 

I never understood the hype my friends had around Chance. I first downloaded Acid Rap and wasn't that into it. Probably listened to it twice and gave up on it. Juice was like the only song I remembered and I honestly thought it was just songs that had annoying sounds and were different. Then I downloaded Coloring Book because everyone was talking about it and listened to it once and thought it was alright. Frank Ocean's Blonde came out around the same time and I definitely gave it way more attention. Then somewhere along the way I listened to it more and more to the point I was obsessed.

Then I went back to Acid Rap and realized how great of an album (not mixtape in my book) it is. Every song is great and it has everything from bangers to slow jams that'll make you think. ""Paranoia"" on it is by far my favorite song and I recommend everyone listen to it, but really pay attention to the words. When he talks about it being summer and wanting it to rain, hating the sound of fireworks, and how everyone dies in the summer it's just depressing but he sings it so beautifully.

My whole point is, if you don't understand the music or like him... give it some time. Listen to coloring book and Acid Rap like 4-5 times before making a decision and you'll slowly find yourself loving every song. 

Sorry for the book I wrote. I've just been wanting to get my Chance rant out of my system for a while now haha

She was dropped off on Jakku for unknown reasons, presumably had to fend for herself, learn other languages, deal with traders and travelers, probably heard about Jedi legends (as per her line about Luke), etc. She would take one look at Luke in A New Hope and go ""pffft"". He's had it easy.

The problem is she's not developed. They're abandoned her developement for sequels. We don't know why she's the way she is. We don't know why she hugs leia, she's meant to be the protagonist. If indeed she is Jason Bourne in space then we needed something in the movie telling us this.

We know why luke is a good pilot - because his father ""was the best"". Him using the force at the end is incredibly simple compared to what Rey was doing. Also, obvious hereditary powers?

We don't know a thing about Rey, which is why we call her a Mary Sue. The fact that she never makes a mistake and needs someone else's intervention makes her a Mary Sue, or Mary Sue-like person.

Now take a 300 pitch game, which is about average, and take the average time between those 300 pitches as 23.8 seconds -- as it has been so far this year -- it comes out to a minute shy of 2 hours. So already we're at 2:45-2:55 not accounting for any pitching changes, reviews, mound visits, arguments, and the long list of other shit that can happen in baseball that doesn't constitute actual play.

If you took that same 300 pitch game and dropped it to 7-8 seconds between pitches like you saw here, you're down from 2:45-2:55 to 1:25-1:35 before pitching changes, et al.  Pretty substantial difference there.",baseball

Though, you *might* have a hard time keeping those white birth rates up because despite claims (by the alt-right) that the [alt-right is sexy.](https://i.imgur.com/Bx4I6Ug.png), the alt-right is pretty much a sausage party with a ratio of about 14 dudes to every one woman. (Heck, I would have anxiety about being ""outbred"" if my peer group were like that too)

Just don't expect to take a country like America that *is not yours* and claim it as the exclusive property of white people.

And if you want to stay in the US, you should stop **crying like a little bitch** about ""white genocide"" when nearly [80 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/) of the **the most ethnically diverse Congress in history** is still white males.

Even if the US becomes a majority-minority country, decades of gerrymandering and ongoing voter suppression of minorities will ensure white rule for decades to come.

&gt; The Band was an influential Canadian-American rock and roll group of the 1960s and '70s, formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Band included Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, drums, harmonica); Richard Manuel (1943-1986) (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone, organ, slide guitar); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (1943-1999) (bass guitar, violin, trombone, guitar), and Levon Helm (1940-2012) (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harmonica).

&gt; The members of The Band first worked together as The Hawks, the backing band of rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 until 1963. Afterwards, Bob Dylan recruited the quintet for his history-making 1965/1966 world tour and they joined him on the informal recordings that became the acclaimed Basement Tapes.

&gt; Dubbed ""The Band"" by their peers, the group left the comfort of their communal home in Saugerties, NY to begin recording as a group unto themselves. The Band recorded two of the most important albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the hit single ""The Weight"") and 1969's The Band. These critically praised albums helped conceive country rock as something more than a genre, but rather as a celebration of ""Americana."" As such, throughout their career they would repopularize traditional American musical forms during the psychedelic era. The Band dissolved in 1976; Martin Scorcese's landmark concert film ""The Last Waltz"" documented their final performance.  They reformed in 1983 without founding guitarist and main songwriter Robbie Robertson.

&gt; Although always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than the general public, The Band has remained an admired and influential group. They have been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

&gt; Their music fused many elements: primarily old country music and early rock and roll, though the rhythm section often had a bouncy, funky punch reminiscent of Stax or Motown, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences. At its best, however, The Band's music was an organic synthesis of many musical genres which became more than the sum of its parts. The group's songwriting was also remarkable as, unlike much earlier rock and roll, and following upon the example set previously by The Byrds, very few of their early compositions were based on conventional blues and doo-wop chord changes.

&gt; The Band comprised Robbie Robertson (guitar); Richard Manuel (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (bass guitar, violin, trombone); and Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar) Excepting Robertson, all were multi-instrumentalists; each person's primary instrument is listed first. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could offer all manner of subtle aural colors and textures to enhance songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax an impressive range of timbres from his Lowrey electronic organ; on the choruses of ""Tears of Rage"", for example, it sounds startlingly like a mellotron. Helm's drumming was rarely flashy, but he was often praised for his subtlety and funkiness. Critic Jon Carroll famously declared that Helm was ""the only drummer who can make you cry,"" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.

&gt; Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's gritty, southern voice had more than a hint of country, Danko sang in a soaring, unfettered tenor, and Manuel alternated between fragile falsetto and a wounded baritone. The singers regularly blended in unorthodox, but uncommonly effective harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared between the three men, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's ""lead"" singer.

&gt; Robertson was the unit's chief songwriter (though he sang lead vocals on only three or four songs in The Band's career). This role, and Robertson's resulting claim to the copyright of most of the compositions, would become a point of much antipathy between the group's members, especially between Robertson and Helm.

&gt; Producer John Simon is cited as a ""sixth member"" of The Band for producing and playing on Music from Big Pink, co-producing and playing on The Band, and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album Jericho.

&gt; On 10 December 1999 is when Rick Danko died in his sleep at age 56. He had been a long-time drug user. In 1997 he had been found guilty of trying to smuggle heroin into Japan. He told the presiding judge that he had begun using the drug (together with prescription morphine) to fight life-long pain resulting from a 1968 auto accident. No drugs were found in his system at the time of his death. Following the death of Rick Danko, The Band broke up for good.

&gt; Levon Helm died on 19 April 2012 from complications of throat cancer.

2963,"Imagine that you have a light. A small, not very powerful light, maybe 2 watts or so. You read somewhere on the internet that the ionosphere (yeah, that's up in the sky, way above the /r/trees - REALLY high) can *bounce light back to the earth* if the light is the right color. You read a bit more and find out that different heights do different things and that if you get just the RIGHT color, you can actually bounce it down, up, down, up and then down again to the *other side of the planet*. Like god's fiber optics in the sky. Deep shit.

So you screw around by adjusting the color and you send a message in morse code. Or if you're really fancy you change the color of the light depending on the waveform of your own voice. You actually get *just* the right frequency so that the light is visible (just barely) to somebody that lives 8,000 miles away.

And here's the really crazy shit: not only does somebody over there see the light and decode the morse code (or your voice), they *send you a message back*. Apparently this guy (or hot, sexy blonde danish woman, if you prefer, but you know it's a guy so that's just a fantasy) saw the same instructables article as you and bought the same kit from some website somewhere. 

And you guys talk for a while. But really it's way more fun to try and see if you can find somebody in a whole different country on the other side of the world. Eventually you decide that if you're really a badass with this thing that you can reach somebody in every country in the world if you really try hard enough. So you sit up late at night, or you spend your entire weekends morning and afternoon, trying to reach people with your little light (which you put on top of your house now, just because it's easier). And, well, you start to look like somebody that hasn't come out of a cave in a while, but you're sort of obsessed and you just can't stop now anyway.

But it's not enough... you decide to bounce that light off of the moon (OK, you need a slightly brighter light here) or bounce it off of freaking meteor trails. Or you decide you are only going to use ultraviolet light that doesn't bounce of of the sky, but that's cool because you can use your grow light and a filter and it doesn't cost you any extra and hey, that thing's pretty bright maybe it will work. Or maybe a blacklight if you started smoking trees in the 70s.

The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur radio operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide.

Google ""10hz on the brain"":

&gt; A 10 Hz rhythm is present in the occipital cortex when the eyes are closed (alpha waves), in the precentral cortex at rest (mu rhythm), in the superior and middle temporal lobe (tau rhythm), in the inferior olive (projection to cerebellar cortex), and in physiological tremor (underlying all voluntary movement).  These are all considered resting rhythms in the waking brain which are “replaced” by higher frequency activity with sensorimotor stimulation.  That is, the 10 Hz frequency fulcrum is replaced on the one hand by lower frequencies during sleep, or on the other hand by higher frequencies during volition and cognition.

&gt; For example, it is known that an identical auditory stimulus evokes a similar cortical response during waking and sleep. However, the perception of the stimulus varies as a function of the arousal state: A stimulus that can be perceived during waking cannot be perceived during sleep.  Underlying this variation in response is a difference in the background frequency, or “context” of the brain, characteristic of waking and sleep states.  During alert waking, it is possible to generate high frequency background activity (~40 Hz gamma band) to facilitate the recognition and integration of stimuli. Yet while asleep, a low frequency background activity (~4 Hz delta band) predominates and, ultimately, negates the ability of the brain to recognize or associate meaning with the stimulus.  Centered amidst this dichotomy are ~10 Hz alpha waves, a veritable fulcrum situated between functional states, a waveform that demarcates the functional shifts between large and small scale ensemble activity. 

https://oatext.com/The-10-Hz-frequency-A-fulcrum-for-transitional-brain-states.php

And also:

&gt; The specific ELF frequencies I was interested in studying are 6-10 Hertz. These frequencies are the same as those produced by the human brain in the theta and alpha states. Generally, specific brain wave frequency ranges can be associated with mood or thought patterns. Frequencies below 8 Hertz are considered theta waves. While these seem to be some of the least understood frequencies, they also seem to be associated with creative, insightful thought. When an artist or scientist has the ""aha"" experience, there's a good chance he or she is in theta. Alpha frequencies are from 8 to 12 Hertz and are commonly associated with relaxed, meditative states.

Most people in their first job don't have enough skills to be paid a ""decent wage"". Hence why they rarely are. 

If you can't get a ""decent wage"" out of graduation, then you need to get a job for the minimum wage and build up skills. 

Anyway, very very few college graduates are working minimum and this ""sub 15 which is considered the minimum living wage in an actual city absolutely"" is nothing but typical adolescent drivel.

3140,"&gt; Our system is by no means perfect but it's the greatest economic system in the history of the world that has provided the most wealth and happiness to the greatest number of people. Name another system as good as capitalism, you can't. Venezuela collapsing is from moving away from capitalism and towards a more communistic system - which is pretty much exactly what you're advocating. You're just rebranding the name. 

This is partially true. The government isn't interested in an economic system that works. The government know exactly how to make this economy boom but is unwilling to do it. The truth is that Capatalism is the absolute best way to rob society because it all looks so good on paper. This way, the people don't complain and the government extracts cash and energy out of the economy without hindrance. So ya, in that way, Capatlism is the best system. Its the easiest on sleeping humans while extremely profitable for the cabal until the humans wake up and realize they were robbed blind of course. 

&gt;I didn't misread anything. You stated in your second point that people would have to continue working their jobs for a year whenever your system is implemented. Your words not mine. By the way nothing is stopping people from deciding what jobs they want to do now. Western culture has the greatest mobility of any culture because people have the freedom to choose what they want to do and as long as they are good enough at it to make money they can continue doing it. 

I was only recommending that people stick to their jobs until they find a replacement. Most people are hindered from following their dreams simply because there's no money in the venture. Take out the money and free everyone so that they can pursue their dreams. 

&gt;People have to be motivated. You work harder (and through your hard work make society better) to earn more money to live a better life. Why would someone work near as hard when they know all they have to do is show up and work half ass for 5 hours and they still get whatever they want. Which by the way, how will we have enough resources for this? If everyone can just swipe a card and get free stuff what's the limit to how much they can get? If there's no limit people will get whatever they want and over use our limited resources. 

In Sacred Economics, we will all work hard to build a wealthy society so that we can all enjoy it. Can you imagine the type of cooperation that would occur among people when everyone has the same exact goal in mind? People will consume as they go. Hoarding would be illegal. If anyoen is found to be reasonably hoarding, they would have to account for the mistake and fix it. Simple. If they are too stupid to understand why hoarding would kill the entire economy, we would have to send them to educational classes explaining the benefits of playing by the rules of society so that it works for all of us. There are always douchbags who are arrogant enough to thik they can somehow outsmart the system and get away with it but we, the people, will policie ourselves for the most part but if someone is really breaking the rules, we would have a court session. Punishment will no longer be used though.. only educational and emotional rehabilitation which actually works.

Definitely better than Alves. He is riding a reputation hard right now. Juve fans are glad he is gone after a very lackluster season. Don't let two top performances in the CL deceive you.

And Walker has been comfortably the best RB in the league these past couple seasons ahead of some of the world's other better RBs like Valencia and Coleman. Outside of Carvajal though, where's his competition? Top teams right now are lacking top RBs. Barca, Bayern and Juventus are pretty much without natural starting quality right backs. There are plenty of good RBs out there and some promising up-and-coming players but all of them are a step below Walker and Carvajal right now. It's part of the reason Bayern, Juve and Barca are pretty much still without RBs, players like Sidibe, Gaspar, Hysaj etc are simply not top quality. Walker is definitely a standout in his position and that's why City are willing to pay so much to bring him in where he'll play in front of Alves.

You cover it up. It festers and eats away at you. Then finally, it explodes. Sometimes violently. And that's not the way to do it.

To get what you want, what you need, you have to communicate. You have to reach out for help and be receptive to it. Whether that means help and support from family, friends, loved ones, therapist, psychiatrist, whatever. It's not weakness to utilize the tools that are available to you.

&gt; Era Istrefi (born 4 July 1995), sometimes known as simply Era (stylized as ERA), is an Albanian Kosovar singer and songwriter. She rose to fame after releasing her debut single ""Mani për money"" in 2013, which gained a positive feedback and attention from the public. Her following songs ""A po don"" and ""E dehun"", gained the same success. In June 2014, she won three Videofest awards for her music videos, including ""Best New Artist"" for her work in 2013.

&gt; In 2015 Era gained success with her song ""Njo si ti"" with over a million views on YouTube in a week. Her first duo featuring well-known Kosovo rapper Ledri Vula, ""Shumë pis"", became a summer hit.

&gt; In January 2016, Istrefi began achieving international attention due to the release of her single ""BonBon"", which drew comparisons to the work of Sia and Rihanna. Following the single's success, she was signed to American record labels Sony Music Entertainment, RCA Records, and Ultra Music in February 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

3249,"&gt; This whole ""Germans hate their soldiers"" thing is nothing but a meme.

So far true. But then again I quote from a comment on to this post:

&gt; Every person that I know that wanted to be a soldier has either fucked up their education and had no other choice, or was a deluded right wing nut that actually dreamt of honor and glory and fit right in with the recent news about the Bundeswehr.

 But there is are two problems:

1. There is a very vocal and active minority against soldiers.
2. While most soldiers understand that the majority in Germany gives a shit about the military. The effect is that the only feedback soldiers get is negative. Let it be in experiences in public or from the press. The press will not report on the military unless it is negative (which is understandable) but then also show a complete lack of understanding on military matters.

To make it clear: As a German soldier you can expect the following things:

1. Be insulted in public.
2. Have the press only talk about your profession when they have a complaint.
3. Have no support from politics.
4. Have no public support whatsoever.

My wish is that they either go back to the more campy style or change Bond into someone working against the system in the name of political progress and in doing so treading into some morally gray areas.

Solo-q is a different beast

Same player, same skills, 2 accounts.. the difference must be, by process of elimination, an external factor: teammates.

Blizzard's system of placing people lower than their MMR so they can rank up at the beginning of the season is broken for people anywhere under high plat. If you are on the cusp, placing below your proper SR puts you in a tier where the genuinely awful players who have no idea about how to play the game are, and then good luck getting out alone.

It's exponentially worse if you do your placements later in the season, as everyone has already ""settled"" to their correct SR, so someone who ends a season at mid gold ends up being placed in silver, with other *actual silvers* rather than other players who just placed below their proper SR and are supposed to ""feel the joy of ranking up""

As the official trade guru of the NBA, Adam Silver has bequeathed (is that a word?) me the responsibility of creating blockbuster trades to reach his goal of making the offseason considerably more interesting than the regular season and playoffs. 

In response, I've laid out the following scenarios: 

[**Trade #1**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yccjd8t2)

**NEW YORK KNICKS**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Tyler Zeller

*why they do it?* as it is, they are considering buying out Carmelo-- receiving Brown + Rozier is a far superior option

**CLEVELAND CAVALIERS**

*sends:* Kevin Love, Eddy Tavares

*receives:* Ryan Anderson, Avery Bradley

*why they do it?* Anderson gives them 85% of Love's production, without sacrificing long-range shooting. Bradley gives them an elite defender and solid shooter.

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela

*receives:* Kevin Love, Eddy Tavares

*why they do it:* Houston knows it takes stars to win in the NBA. This gives them a terrific trio of CP3/Harden/Love. 

**BOSTON CELTICS**

*sends:* Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Tyler Zeller

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony, Clint Capela 

*why they do it:* Avery Bradley is a valuable player and Jaylen Brown has great potential, but Carmelo is precisely the #1 scoring option they need to take Boston over the hump. Capela is a very solid big who lessens the pain of losing two young players. 

__________________________________________________

[**Trade #2**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y76sq2qx)

**NEW ORLEANS**

*sends:* Omer Asik, Demarcus Cousins

*receives:* Zach Collins, Mo Harkless

*why they do it*: Cousins and Brow isn't an ideal fit, and Asik may have the worst contract in the league. This sheds them of the Asik contract, nets a high upside big in Collins, and an upside wing in Harkless.

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Zach Collins, Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, Ed Davis

*receives:* Demarcus Cousins, Jerryd Bayless

*why they do it*: Lillard-McCollum-Cousins

**PHILADELPHIA**

*sends:* Jahlil Okafor, Jerryd Bayles

*receives:* Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lin

*why they do it*: Okafor's value has diminished significantly and his style doesn't mesh with the core-4. This nets them a complimentary young big in Meyers, and a much-needed veteran presence in Lin

**BROOKLYN**

*sends:* Jeremy Lin

*receives:* Jahlil Okafor, Omer Asik, Ed Davis

*why they do it:* Brooklyn's best move is to take on bad contracts in order to get young assets. Okafor still has star potential (think Al Jefferson) and DeAngelo Russell + Jahlil Okafor makes their young core somewhat intriguing. 

_________________________________________________________

[**Trade #3**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ycuqs8ov)

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Noah Vonleh, Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*receives:* Kevin Love

*why they do it:* they acquire a legitimate star player in Love to pair with their excellent guard duo-- without giving up any needle-moving pieces (unless Collins develops into a star)

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Zach Collins, Noah Vonleh, Allan Crabbe

*why they do it: *The Knicks are in re-build mode, and losing Carmelo without a return of young talent is ill-advised. This nets them three young players with solid potential. 

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony

*why they do it:* Love is a bit younger than Anthony-- but a less potent scorer-- and Melo is good friends with Lebron, and makes a terrific trio with Kyrie and LBJ. Certainly a win-now move. 

_______________________________

[**Trade #4**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y7acvc3k)

A variation on Trade 3, with more incentive for Cleveland.

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Noah Vonleh, Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*receives:* Kevin Love, Edy Tavares

*why they do it:* they acquire a legitimate start player in Love to pair with their excellent guard duo-- without giving up any needle-moving pieces (unless Collins develops into a star)

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*why they do it:* The Knicks are in re-build mode, and losing Carmelo without a return of young talent is ill-advised. This nets them two young players with solid potential. 

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love, Edy Tavares

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony, Ryan Anderson

*why they do it:* Carmelo forms a potent offensive trio with Kyrie and Lebron, while Anderson lessens the blow of losing Love's stretch-4 shooting ability. 

**HOUSTON**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson

*receives:* Noah Vonleh, JR Smith

*why they do it:* sheds them of Anderson's contract, opening roster flexibility. Ads a great 6th man (Smith) at a cheaper cost and shorter contract (than Anderson). 

__________________________________________________________

[**Trade #5**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ybwex42w)

**BOSTON**

*sends:* Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Jordan Mickey, Tyler Zeller

*receives:* Kevin Love, Clint Capela

*why they do it:* Brown and Smart are tough to give up, but for Love+Capela it's worth the risk. The move gives Boston a starting 5 of: 

Thomas-Bradley-Crowder-Love-Horford with Tatum+Capela off the bench.

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love

*receives:* Ryan Anderson, Marcus Smart

*why they do it:* With Bron+Kyrie, Love's skills cannot be properly utilized in Cleveland. This move gets them a knock-down shooter and a gritty, merciless defender.  

**HOUSTON**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony

*why they do it:* Morey strikes again! Paul/Harden/Melo trio can go toe-to-toe with any other three. 

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Jaylen Brown, Tyler Zeller, Jordan Mickey

*why they do it:* Hmm... buy out  Carmelo and get nothing for him? Or take on Zellers contract and get Jaylen Brown's terrific potential to pair with Porzingis? ",nba

4016,"&gt;The word autumn comes from the ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.[11] It was borrowed by the neighbouring Romans, and became the Latin word autumnus.[12] After the Roman era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French) or autumpne in Middle English,[13] and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.

...

&gt;The alternative word fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English fiæll or feallan and the Old Norse fall all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning ""to fall from a height"" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like ""fall of the leaf"" and ""fall of the year"".[16]

[The Downside of the FCC’s New Internet Privacy Rules](http://hbr.org/2016/05/the-downside-of-the-fccs-new-internet-privacy-rules) 

&gt;To understand why the FCC’s involvement would create more problems than it would solve, it helps to understand a massive shift in web security over the last few years: the overwhelmingly successful campaign to encrypt data flowing to and from consumers over the Internet.

&gt;Encrypting data traffic ensures that information you send and receive can’t be decoded by anyone — including criminals, government snoops, and even the ISPs who provide your access to the internet. The latter group includes home and mobile broadband providers, and anyone — your cable provider or a coffee shop — who offers a Wi-Fi connection. Encryption means that only the sites you visit can see the contents of your interactions with them, which is how e-commerce companies, apps and other can provide customized suggestions, responses, directions, and advertisements.

&gt;According to Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, disclosures of government hacking by former security contractor Edward Snowden greatly accelerated the push to encrypt everything.  Over half of all web traffic is now secured, as invisible to ISPs as it is to the NSA.  By the end of this year, that number will climb to 70%. Most email is already encrypted. Skype is encrypted, as are your interactions with Netflix and, increasingly, the videos you watch. In the next five to 10 years, encryption will become even more ubiquitous.

&gt;For mobile devices and the apps that run on them, the trend is increasingly to provide users with end-to-end encryption, meaning even the provider can’t reveal your data, with or without a court order...

And 

&gt;As a side-effect of the encryption campaign, ISPs are largely blind, for better and for worse, to consumer information of any kind, let alone what the FCC calls the “very sensitive and very personal” information that content and other on-line service providers have routinely used, so far to tremendous effect and minimal malevolence.

And then later he says: 

&gt;Yet to enforce consumer complaints that ISPs are violating the FCC’s proposed privacy rules, the agency will need expansive access to data traffic, not only of the complaining consumer but of other consumers. Providing technical back-doors for governments, however, is precisely the outcome Apple, WhatsApp, and other participants in the internet ecosystem are spending so much political capital to avoid. If history is any guide, it’s clear that once government agencies gain access to personal information, the likelihood of that data leaking elsewhere — the NSA, but also the IRS, the INS, and other regulators — is nearly 100%.

&gt;So why would rational consumers who value both their privacy and the effective customization of their online life want another regulatory “cop on the beat”— especially at a time when concerns over government information gathering are reshaping the technical architecture of the Web and mobile devices specifically to limit their access? It’s an issue that both consumers and businesses should be paying closer attention to.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/dd463f5c63464b299616ef2baef598f1.png)  

&gt; Etta James (1938-2012) was a U.S.  blues, soul, R&amp;B, rock &amp; roll, and jazz singer and songwriter. She is the winner of four Grammies, seventeen Blues Music Awards, and was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame (in 1993), the Blues Hall of Fame (in 2001), and the Grammy Hall of Fame (in both 1999 and 2008).

&gt; James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles, California, on 25th January 1938, to an unmarried fourteen-year-old mother, Dorothy Hawkins. According to Etta, her mother claimed that her father was the white Rudolph  ""Minnesota Fats"" Wanderone, and that they received financial support from him on the condition that they keep his paternity a secret. This seems unlikely, though it has not been definitively disproved. Etta was born in Los Angeles in 1938. At the time, Wanderone was known to be managing a pool hall in Washington, D.C. and had not yet become known to be the cross-country traveller he later became. 

&gt; She received her first professional vocal training at five years old from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at St Paul Baptist Church in Los Angeles.  Her family moved to San Francisco in 1950, and she teamed up with two other girls to form a doo-wop singing group. When the girls were fourteen, band leader Johnny Otis had them audition. They sang an answer to Hank Ballard's ""Work with Me, Annie"" called ""Roll Wwth Me Henry"".  Otis particularly liked the song, and against her mother's wishes, James and the trio went to Los Angeles to record the song in 1954. The song was recorded on the label Modern Records. By this time, the trio renamed the song ""The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)"" and released it in 1955. James named her vocal group The Peaches. Richard Berry, a Los Angeles doo-wop luminary, is featured on some of their records.

&gt; ""The Wallflower"" reached number two on the rhythm and blues charts in February 1955, but was undercut in the wider market by a rushed-out cover version by Georgia Gibbs on Mercury Records; in fact, the very first time Gibbs was recorded in studio, they used the first take recorded and it became number one on the top 100 songs nationally. The song's royalties were divided between Hank Ballard, Etta James, and Johnny Otis, and its huge success attracted the attention of the R&amp;B world, resulting in James going on tour with Little Richard. On the tour, though, according to James, she witnessed and experienced situations to which minors are not usually privy, and she allegedly acquired a drug habit.

&gt; Soon after the success of ""Wallflower"", The Peaches and James parted company, but this did not halt her career. Shecontinued to record and release albums throughout much of the decade, and enjoyed more success. Her follow-up, ""Good Rockin' Daddy"", became another fifties hit. Other songs however, such as ""Tough Lover"" and ""W-O-M-A-N"" failed to gain any significant success. James toured with Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson and Otis Redding in the fifties, and has cited Watson as the most significant influence on her style..

&gt; In 1960, James signed a recording contract with Chess Records. She went on to have the biggest success of her career from this label, recording her biggest and most memorable hits. Chess went into high gear with James, releasing many duets with her then boyfriend, the married Harvey Fuqua, who was the lead singer of the Moonglows. One of her duets with Fuqua, ""If I Can't Have You"", became a hit on the R&amp;B charts in 1960. As a solo artist however, she had more enduring success. One of her first singles released by Chess in 1960 was called ""All I Could Do Was Cry""; this blues number became a big hit on the R&amp;B charts in 1960. Leonard Chess, one of the founders of Chess Records, helped James along the way. He saw the potential for her to go in a more pop-oriented direction, and she started recording more pop tunes for the label.

&gt; The year 1961 became a year of great change for James. In 1961 came the release of one of her first pop-oriented tunes called ""At Last"". The song became a big hit in 1961, reaching number two on the R&amp;B charts. The song even went as far as twenty-two on the pop charts that year. It became her signature song. Other songs, such as ""Trust in Me"", also became hits, and the 1962 tune ""Something's Got a Hold On Me"" showed more of James' gospel side, a genre she had sung since childhood.

&gt; She had other big hits in the 1960s, but mainly on the R&amp;B charts: the song ""Pushover"" in 1963 and ""Stop the Wedding"", ""Fool That I Am"", and ""Don't Cry Baby"", were hits for her between 1961 and 1963. Her 1963 album Etta James Rocks the House, recorded at Nashville's ""New Era"" club, also gave her career a boost. James then became one of the most successful R&amp;B artists of the 1960s, having many more top ten and top twenty hit singles. Performing in Memphis, Tennessee helped make her into a blues icon.

&gt; In 1967, James released her next hit single, ""Tell Mama"", and it became a top ten hit on the R&amp;B charts. After a dry period of no hits for almost four years, the song once more made James a household name. The follow-up, ""Security"", was also a success, and proved that James had staying power on the charts again. Whilst less success came for James after this hit, she was still on the charts regularly and, despite the death of Leonard Chess, stayed with the Chess label into 1975. Towards the end of the Chess years though, she went into more rock-based songs. She recorded for many other labels, and continued to release albums, such as 1978's Deep In the Night on Atlantic Records.

&gt; Despite a dry period during the early to mid 1980s, James got back on track and began to record music again. She received accolades for her 1981 rendition of Randy Newman's ""God's Song"". Her 1988 album Seven Year Itch proved this comeback capability; the album showed more of her soul side. In 1989, she recorded the song ""Avenue D"" with David A. Stewart of Eurythmics. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the Robert Wise film Rooftops. She also performed with the Grateful Dead for two shows in 1982. In the 1990s she continued to record and perform. Her albums widely varied in styles and genres. Her 1992 album, The Right Time, was another soul album that was released by Elektra Records. She also began to record more jazz, which became the style for many of her 1990s albums.

&gt; Drug-related and romantic problems interfered with her career, but James managed to maintain a career throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. Later in life, she struggled with obesity. She reached nearly twenty-nine stones, experienced mobility and knee problems, and often needed a wheelchair. In 2003, she underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost over fourteen stones.

&gt; She died on 20th January 2012.

4106,"I bet you they follow the raiders next. Season 1 I'm not 100% why they followed the Cardinals. Maybe because they were expected to do decent and it's a good underdog story.  But, as a Cardinals fan I can tell you it brought a LOT of new football fans. Our sub was flooded with people from all over the world asking questions about how the NFL worked and jumping on the bandwagon. (I'm sure they fell right back off after last year though) people that aren't even football fans loved the show because of how it digs into the emotional stories and investments these players make.

  I think they picked the Rams for season 2 for this purpose. They were trying to suck in new fans in LA. To me, season 2 sucked in comparison (of course I might be a little bias). I mean, ilthe editing was amazing, but season 1 had a team that was hot. They were rolling and climaxed with one of the best playoff games in NFL history. Then followed by a huge let down in the NFCCG. You see all the emotion crash and burn, it hits even a non fan right in the feels. 

  But the Rams had none of that. There was no climax, the whole season was... Meh... It was still awesome as a football fan to see under the hood of an NFL team, but it didn't bring in any new fans. It may have gave existing fans hope but it bored everyone else. 

  I think season 2 was an attempt to bring new fans to a relocated franchise. But I don't think it worked so well. Season 3 might follow the Raiders? Or they might pick a team that has high expectations because that is a lot more interesting.",nfl

4111,"Hey, hate to be the buzzkill here since I'm not suggesting Annie.
I'm no master of league but a good champ to main is Talon because there's not much that he lacks.
To give a few pros:

* High mobility - his Q is a gap closer that, with decent decision making, helps you reach the right targets (especially since it's point-click). His E is quite literally parkour that can be used for gap closing and escaping, and though it has internal cooldowns, makes for a very useful ability if used properly, hence the maining aspect. If it's any use, his ult gives him bonus MS (scaling with rank) that lets you either position on a carry or run from a fight, both of which you can use frequently since the cooldown is low late game.

* Waveclear - this is has been debated for a while (at least in my circles) but since his W is AoE, it helps with the tried and true shove and roam technique. He clears minion waves pretty quick so in a few match ups you're free to push out and roam (more on this later). In match ups where you get pushed in, W allows you to clear from a relatively (relative to opponent champ's range) safe distance. It's a useful tool for CS'ing when you're new to him too.

* Kill potential - this is pretty straightforward; During the early game, he has insane (and often unexpected) amount of burst with his level 2 and level 6 all-in's because of his bleed passive and the damage you get in one spell rotation, coupled with auto attacks which hurt. If you were to run ignite against a squishy mid lane opponent, it's nearly almost guaranteed that you will either get a kill at level 2/6 or at the very least a summoner spell or two. As a side note, his W-Q combo is pretty good poke early and using only his W gets you good poke onto a target. He spikes midgame and 100-0 anyone maybe other than a (fed) tank. He wears down tanks too over time but usually sustain beats burst so your job anyway is pretty much to delete the carries in a fight or pick them out. Late game he falls off a bit, like other traditional assassins but his burst and one shot potential is still pretty good on squishies and if you get the ADC or fed mage, you win the fight. 

* Variable playstyles (in the laning phase) - again, pretty debatable, feel free to correct me wherever you think I'm wrong, but Talon can be played in a couple of styles. The most common is where you focus on roaming and pretty much shove and roam all throughout laning phase to either help get other lanes ahead or get yourself a kill or two to start the snowball. Talon has really good roaming potential cause of his kit and it's insane how easy it is to get that first kill in bot lane. It also helps that he snowballs very hard and can often use that to his advantage in lane and out of lane; one kill is enough for you to carry up to the mid game and stay relevant in the late game (after all you only have to delete the squishies). The other is to focus only on your lane and try to go even in CS and maybe get a kill in lane or an advantage to have the opponent fall behind. I'm sure there are more ways to play him, just not going to list them all or else this will get longer than it already is. Now I'm not saying that all the playstyles are the most efficient, but just putting it out there that Talon has different playstyles that you can use depending on how you like to play. In all cases though, it would be about trying your best to snowball a lead so you hit your spike faster (which is kind of the meta way of winning now) and if you don't, it's okay because you tend to stay relevant throughout the game. I would refer to [r/talonmains](https://reddit.com/r/talonmains) for this.

* Meta - Talon manages to stay a good or decent pick in every meta (obviously player skill should be taken into account too) and only sometimes does he feel really weak, like when lethality was nerfed and when it was released. Right now though, he sits at a 52% winrate and the lethality buffs and the change to its scaling has made it perfect for snowbally solo laners such as him. He even builds duskblade which at the time of writing is pretty broken.

Cons:

* Tough/unfavorable matchups - the current mid meta favors ranged mages that have some form of utility and damage or some poke such as Orianna (never a bad time to pick her lol), Syndra, Corki. One of the biggest counters to Talon (and every assassin in general) is CC so anyone with some form of it makes it just a bit tough for you to play against. This is where 'farming with W' comes in. Since you're melee it makes it pretty easy for a lot of mages to poke you down so that makes laning a bit hard and hence why roaming is a better option. Don't take it that heavily though cause his laning is still better than a lot of assassins.

* Team reliance - yes you can carry the game with him quite well if you master him but since he's an assassin, it's easy to block him out of a fight if the opponent team is coordinated. You need your team to help you get to the right people and since it's solo q, that gets slightly tough. In lane, you need jungle pressure often because you get pushed in relatively easy by mages and usually that also means they put themselves in danger which is potential to net you a kill in case you do get your jungler to gank.

To conclude, it's nice to have that Talon is pretty fun to play and has huge carry potential in a meta where the outcome depends on how well you do early and midgame. He's also relatively easy to pick up and somewhat tough to master but you reap the benefits of doing so anyway.

Yes, Steelers D is all about attacking and taking risks *except* when it comes to pass coverage.

Also, I see Harrison and Woodley dropping into coverage very often.  I think that's a mistake in general.

On each team there were 2 MLB EX-Pros, 1 European pro, 1 softball pro (woman) and 1 English cricket player. Each batter got 2 minutes to hit as many hone runs as possible. There were 3 rounds, the first round had all 5 team member, the second round had the best two batters from each team, the third and final round was just the best batter from each team and they got 3 minutes to hit instead of 2. Those distance markers were actually targets, if they hit those then the batters got 3 points instead of just the one for a regular homerun.

And his dad's method wasn't correct per se. He ends up shooting his dad at the funeral (proof that he either still cannot control his sensitivity or disliked him for the abusive training regimes), the stimming session also failed after he wasn't allowed to finish auditing the robotic companies books. The second is more telling because his dad's entire reasoning behind submitting them to the training was that being flooded with sensory stimulation would prepare him better for the world as a whole because the world doesn't give a fuck. Yet he still struggles with controlling himself during high stress moments in his adult life. That suggests the psychological goal of the training failed.

However, he gains a skillset that allows him to live a life where he is able to largely remove overstimulation and have areas where he can unwind in his ""perfect conditions"" (the airstream, the idyllic house with barely any furniture, his own business).

4223,"Adding on to this comment, as a Gen-X'er in Alberta who hangs out on the golf course with many baby boomers who made their wealth in O&amp;G, I can tell you that out here the vitriol for Trudeau is a double barreled shotgun of ""He's a Liberal"" and ""Son of the Great Evil Pierre Trudeau"".   When Justin Trudeau forgot to mention Alberta in his Canada Day speech... OH BOY was there ever a field day with that one, and it just reinforced what so many Albertans already think and feel.

I'm very liberal minded and depending on my mood and how well my game is going that day, sometimes I'll playfully get into it with the Trudeau haters.  But for the OP, and many other Canadians outside of Alberta, they need to realize some very important things:

* 1 [Pierre Trudeau's NEP of the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Energy_Program) was viewed as pure highway robbery.  Quoting from the Wikipedia article on the NEP:

&gt; ""the NEP was considered by Albertans to be among the most unfair federal policies ever implemented. Scholars calculated the program cost Alberta between $50 and $100 billion.""  

Can you imagine what the political environment would be like if this happened to Quebec?

* 2 Historically, due to population distributions in Canada where Quebec and Ontario hold the lions share of population, Alberta has always felt ""we"" are subjugated by the East, and those governments have overwhelmingly been Liberal governments. 

* 3  Feeding into #2, Alberta's contribution to the federal equalization payments have been a constant point of contention, especially given how little say Alberta has traditionally had in the Federal government.  [Between 2000 and 2014, on a net basis, Alberta’s individual and corporate taxpayers shipped an estimated $200 billion-plus to the federal government. That’s what left the province, less what the feds reinvested.](http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-how-much-money-has-flowed-out-of-alberta-to-ottawa-a-lot)

So - there's a ton of historical context into where the Trudeau hate comes from.

He hate's democracy in Norway because we are historically more left wing. He thinks there's a silent majority of people who want to throw the muslims out that are being silenced, and if there isn't, people are clearly being brainwashed. From his manifest:


&gt;So how do we treat freethinkers asking sensitive questions in the 21st century West? In my own country, the Ombud for Gender Equality recently became The Equality and Antidiscrimination Ombud. Its duties include combating “discriminatory speech” and negative statements about other cultures and religions. If accused of such discrimination, one has to mount proof of innocence. In effect, this institution is a secular or Multicultural Inquisition: the renunciation of truth in favor of an ideological lie. Galileo Galilei faced the same choice during the Inquisition four hundred years earlier. The Multicultural Inquisition may not threaten to kill you, but it does threaten to kill your career, and that goes a long way in achieving the same result, whether your crime is claiming that the earth moves around the sun or that not all cultures are equal.


&gt;The control of borders and the sovereignty of nation states are linked to the list above. Democratic decisions are meaningless if they can be overruled by an external authority. This notion of sovereignty is being challenged all over the Western world both through the United Nations and through the ascendence of international law. Sovereignty is clearly not present in much of Europe, where seventy percent or more of all laws passed are federal EU laws. Democratically elected national parliaments have been reduced to insignificance. It is thus possible to argue that Western European countries are no longer distinct democracies, nor are they part of the “Free World” in any meaningful sense. Europeans thus have universal suffrage, but *we don’t have genuine democracy* and we certainly don’t have true liberty.


&gt;This dilemma can be solved by stating the following: Our goal is not democracy in itself, meaning elections and one man one vote, but freedom of conscience and speech, respect for property rights and minorities, the right to bear arms and self-defence, equality before the law and the rule of law - and by that I mean secular law - in addition to such principles as formal constraints on the power of the rulers and the consent of the people. Free elections may be a means of achieving this end, but it is not the end in itself. We shouldn’t confuse the tools with the primary goal.


&gt;If democracy is supposed to mean that citizens vote to decide their
future, then Sweden is not a democracy; it is a multicultural dictatorship. One can vote for a variety of parties, but all of them support the same multiculturalism and mass immigration. Ordinary Swedes have little influence over their own future, and freedom of speech is non-existent. But the country still has the formal aspects of democracy: regular multiparty elections take place. This should remind us once again that elections do not automatically lead to a free society.


&gt;The US Founding Fathers feared “mob rule” and tried to insulate the elected representatives of Congress from what they perceived as the fickleness of the general populace. I understand this viewpoint. We should be less religious about what is or is not democracy. Democracy should never be a goal in itself, nor should all legislation be passed according to the whim of the majority at a given moment. The ideal is a balanced and well-functioning system.


&gt;If we want a *permanent cultural conservative regime (despite our non-democratic methods)*, we have to reach out to inspire and earn the country's deep trust in our ideas and our leadership. We need their loyalty for the long run.


&gt;The most important thing to realise is that democracy is a tool, a means we use to achieve an end. Too many people now confuse it with the end itself. ""Democracy"" has come to mean something that is good, something everybody wants, a bit like sex or chocolate. But there is no rational reason to assume that democracy of universal suffrage is uniformly good and can be applied with equal success in all circumstances, a huge mistake Americans made in Iraq.


&gt;The king or queen of a country is more democratic than a president ever could be because he or she represents all citizens. An elected president would owe his selection to a political faction, and this would publicly divide him from many of his countrymen and would make his claim to represent ""the people"" less convincing. Frequent selections of presidents would interrupt the continuity essential for an effective head of a country. An elected president will always be partisan, whereas a monarch will not be. The king/queen and her heirs have been trained from birth for one vocation -- that of discharging the duties of sovereign of the country. Therefore, they are the only citizens fit to assume this important position.

4420,"I agree with most of your statements. Something to keep in mind is that Japan is a different culture with their own ideals and features. They do have a political correct way of speaking, it's just different from here. Things that may seem like insults in the Americas have no weight in Japan, likewise some things that are major grievances there are not worried about here.

A good example is situational etiquette. In many Asian countries, Japan included, there are proper and improper ways to do pretty much anything, usually around the theme of seniority. The one that I am most familiar with is drinking etiquette  (don't judge me) so I'll use that as my primary example. In the Americas, when you go out drinking with coworkers/student-peers everyone gets their own drinks, usually served for you, and if a cheers is called then everyone raises their glasses as equals regardless of age/experience. In asia it isn't the same. You can pour your own beer into a glass if you're given one but you do *not* pour your own hard alcohol. Someone else will do it for you. If they are your junior then they will serve you with two hands and you receive it with one. If they are your senior they pour with one and you revive with two. If you are of equal standing (age, rank, chain of comand, experience) then you both can use one hand. If a cheers is called then you raise your glass lower than anyone above you and higher than anyone below you (in rank, age, etc). To not follow these rules is a personal affront to whoever you are drinking with.

All this to say, different cultures feel differently about different things. Japan does have a PC culture, but like many other facets of their culture is not the same as their equivalents in the West.",anime

Sure, though, it does start to get muddy when it's based on a real person.

Not much, except that the same people who helped make the special effects in this film look so realistic are now making the parts for simulated surgeries look lifelike so as to assist practicing doctors. The people who worked on the special effects for this movie, Lisa and Eric Chamberlain, are also the founders of the Chamberlain Group, a design and modeling studio that was started in 1999 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. They worked on the visual effects for The Matrix in addition to other films such as Ghostbusters, Predator and the early Superman movies. Now that movies have more effects created by computers, the people at the Chamberlain Group have taken their model making skills to the medical world.*""

I'm not talking about damage output or relative strength to other legendaries. Read what I'm actually saying.

Arms' rotation is clunky, boring, and simple. You hit CS. You hit MS. You spam WW until CS is up again. If MS is up and tactician hasn't procc'd, you use artifact ability in place of CS. Repeat until execute phase. It's literally 3 buttons 99% of the time.

The ring proc actually gave you options and some dynamics to the rotation. Execute becoming available meant you had choices to make. More importantly, it meant you had something to do between CS procs besides spamming one ability over and over. 

Damage or usefulness of arms warriors aside, nerfing the proc rate specifically is just a straight nerf to how fun the spec is to play.

Chelsea should still be the favorite for me but they have CL now and it doesn't look like the whole club is in unity right now after the Lukaku saga. With that being said if they get Rüdiger, Bakayoko and a striker in it's still a very good transfer window. 
    
Man City will be awesome offensively next season. They already played so much better at the end of last season and also looked defensively quite solid.

[Euphemism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism)

Here's another word you might be interested in looking up ""Hypocrisy""

&gt;Really? Quoting me out of context?

It's called using your opponents words against his. And it's always a good tactic to throw someone off balance.

&gt;Who gets to decide this standard? You? You don't even like the genre, Why would we let someone who doesn't like the genre decide industry standards?

And neither are you by calling calling my based complains ""petty"". You're not calling the shots either by setting the bar or in your case lowering the bar and make all this BS believable to the point of falsely calling it ""realistic"". But so far in this thread, you're the only one calling this BS realistic when others aknowledge the BS and still like it.

&gt;1) Not assumptions, you're misusing that word repeatedly 

Grab a dictionary buddy. Assumptions: Noun. a thing that is accepted as true or as certain **to happen**, **without proof**.

Sounds a lot what you've been doing by telling us the MC might not even have a family or friends to mourn him over.

&gt;2) Your complaint was that someone who had died wasn't interested in anything else other than what was going on while he was drinking tea with literal fucking God, I gave you a perfectly possible explanation as to why he isn't concerned with those things. Assuming would be saying he is an otaku and they don't give a shit about anyone but that would actually be assuming. Regardless he straight up went to ask after requesting the phone if he would be able to use it properly to which God answered in the negative 

My complain was that his story or the lack of is totally unbeliveable.

If he lives alone, he must have a job to sustain himself. If he has a job, then at least his employeer will miss him when he died. 

How is it possible he feels no attachment to his past life, but suddenly feels the need to save two complete strangers when he couldn't give himself a second to think of those he left behind in the first place? It's totally absurd.

&gt;Just like you're looking for a reason to dumpster on it

A ton of people had already stated that they find the Mc quite bland and therefore unbeliveable. On the other hand you're the only one in this thread calling all this BS realistic.

&gt;You know nothing either, That's the point of discussion and coming up with potential answers until more information is given 

And most of the time an actual beliveable explanations to all this horsehit won't come up anyway, so why wait? I got as much right to question all this BS than you have to ""assume"" oh my bad, give ""potential reason"". The difference is that you have no hardcore proof to stand on.


&gt;Giving a token ""It's trash and I'm trash for liking it"" is not very **honest**, It's avoiding judgment on perceived taste

I never said you had to call yourself trash for liking something. But admiting you like something that it's publically ignored or frown upon talks about honesty. Unlike to what you're doing.

&gt;Oh I don't disagree it has flaws, But I'm not going to sit there and let you dumpster on a show thats enjoyable with petty complaints 

And I have pretty much the same rights to question all these farfetched events you so call ""realistic""

I think he was trying to say that weed smokers are... just different in their own way. Almost everyone drinks socially, but for weed, it's like that secret club that people talks about with each other. You wouldn't be friends or know some of these people if it weren't for weed type of thing. 

For example, I just hung out with my friend's dad on the very premise that he smoked marijuana. If he drank, I guess it would be cool to kick it with him, but I don't think that would be something I would be AS interested in.

Don't duo lane, solo lane. 

Once you dominated your enemy and warded your bush, push the fuck out of that lane with your E spell. 

When you hit 7 or 8 (when you are done with the tower top), do the blue buff and start ganking.

In teamfights, you need to poke and heal (Q and E them). Once you guys are winning and they start running, heal your teammates and pop cougar form.

No it wasn't. It was reducing Bev to a sexual object. Eleven year old girls don't ""fight back and triumph"" over fears of their emerging sexuality by deciding to have full-on penetrative sex with all their male friends at once. That doesn't fucking happen. 


You know what an 11 year old girl in Bev's situation *would* do? She would make the first move and kiss the boy she likes. Maybe hold his hand. THE END. 



In the context of the book, that would have worked fine for Bev facing her fears. For her to give voice and action to her and Bill's budding feelings for each other would have been a very brave and scary and *plausible* thing for a eleven year old girl to do. Plus, it could have acted as a ""steeling"" moment for Bill, the defacto leader of their little gang, that gives him the ability to lead them out of the sewers. All without a pre-pubescent girl ""deciding"" it's a good idea to let her guy friends run a train on her.

4868,"This picture is CG just like the footage of planes impacting WTC were CG. 911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?

A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk

Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw

This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0

These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0

You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg

You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k

The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc

But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1

The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their ""art"" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207

Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report

Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.

They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw

According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q

WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY

The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.

http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html

Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/

Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ

The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I

Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579

Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the ""art students"":

A thread like this will attract Messi-lovers and there will be many comments extolling the virtues of Messi with some people who are very invested in loving Ronaldo offering some counter examples or disagreeing. If it was a statistic flattering Ronaldo, the tenor of the discussion here would be the exact opposite. 

I have to disagree. This sub does prefer Messi more. You see more fans of other clubs saying he's best than in cr7 thread. Even in cr7 threads, comments like goat or best ever doesn't get upvoted. I dont think its either about being biased or smarter, its just that for past few seasons, messi has far more brilliant performances which gets more attention in this sub.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c36cc68620304b1fbd3137f4aa514ac4.png)  

&gt; The Butterfly Effect were a hard rock band from Brisbane, Australia, formed in 1999. Since February 2002 the band has toured Australia and Europe extensively, and have performed over 800 times both locally and overseas as a headlining act. The band have performed at all major rock festivals in Australia including Big Day Out, Homebake, Livid and Falls Festival.

&gt; Their first EP, The Butterfly Effect (EP), was released in 2001, and charted well on the ARIA Independent charts. This first release, featuring the Triple J single ""Take Me Away"", was more ""nu-metal"" than later recordings although contained much of what was to become their signature soundscapes. They followed this with the critically-acclaimed Begins Here, released on 3 August 2003. The album peaked at No. 23 in Australia, reaching gold sales accreditation by mid-2006. It produced the minor hit Always, and attracted considerable critical acclaim

&gt; On 17 June 2006, the album Imago was released, with a move towards progressive rock and a less heavy sound. It was produced in Los Angeles by Joe Barresi, who had just produced Tool's ""10,000 Days"" album. The album was commercially successful, being featured on national radio station Triple J, peaking at No. 2 in Australia in its first week and attaining gold sales accreditation just nine weeks later. The single A Slow Descent also peaked at No. 9 on the singles charts.

&gt; Their next album, Final Conversation of Kings, was released on 20 September 2008. It was produced by Forrester Savill on the Central Coast of New South Wales, and represented a significant change in their sound, but did not match either the commercial or critical success of previous releases despite charting at No.3 in its first week in Australia.

&gt; On 6 February 2012, the band announced on Facebook the following message:

&gt; The Butterfly Effect wish to inform their fans and media that singer Clint Boge is officially leaving the band to pursue other musical interests. The remaining members of the band, Ben Hall, Kurt Goedhart and Glenn Esmond will continue to work together and will announce their intentions in the not too distant future.

&gt; Clint’s departure is an amicable one and the band are giving fans a chance to see them perform together for the last time on the club circuit by announcing the “EFFECTED” national tour starting late April 2012. To celebrate 10 years of recordings The Butterfly Effect is releasing an “EFFECTED” compilation CD of their best work in April and signed copies will be available at shows on the tour.""

&gt; In late 2013, the band introduced new singer Paul Galagher with the release of a single, ""Eyes Down"", and a small tour. However, the band soon became inactive, and in 2016, it was announced that they had permanently disbanded. Read more on Last.fm.

With teeming coming up, I am going to use a defensive legendary, and an AoE one, then switch it out right before a boss fight.

I am not sure why people don't switch out their legendaries in M+ runs, you just setup different sets, label them properly, and change out before/after every fight.

As a random example:  I will kill a boss, then put on my ghost wolf boots while I run to the next mobs, then switch back to my next set, and so on.

It's been hoisted by the greatest hockey players in history. Whether you connect with the logo of the team you get drafted by or not, you have idols, hall of famers, who players and fans a like have looked up to win that trophy.

He doesn't play there, he didn't grow up there, but him and the community are tighter knit than Sidney Crosby is when he plays for team Canada.

These are the fans that come out and cheer you on year after year, through thick and thin.

&gt; Starset is an American alternative rock band from Columbus, OH formed by Dustin Bates, lead vocalist of Downplay.
The band released their debut album ""Transmissions"" on July 8, 2014 on Razor and Tie label. For the first week album sold more than 5,300 copies.  The album debuted at #49 in the Billboard 200. In addition to the Billboard 200 album hit in other charts. In the category ""Hard Music"" album debuted #5, ""Rock"" #15 and a ""Digital"" #24.

&gt; In the early hours of New Years Day 2013, a radio astronomer at the Allen Telescope Array in northern California discovered a mysterious signal emanating from a star within the Ophiuchus Constellation. 

&gt; Contained within the signal was a Message--of human origin--foretelling the details of man's imminent demise. The Message was brought to The Starset Society, who quickly realized the importance of its immediate publication. 

&gt; Risking extreme danger, The Starset Society commissioned a group of musicians and scientists to assist them in spreading the knowledge to a broader audience. This group became known simply as STARSET. 

&gt; Please hold. STARSET will begin the TRANSMISSION of the Message to the public shortly.

I couldnt believe he said that being against weed, but it made me happy my brother loves me enough to support me too. I didnt believe him when he said that just because i didnt want to get my hopes up but now im making it a reality. dont give up, if you know its right for you. you may have lost the battle, but not the war. 

edit after found out youre 19: damn man, it might be a bit late to rebel. I know its hard not smoking and saving for a place but if you get a cool girlfriend itll be paradise. ive seen a few homies go that route of staying home and smoking weed (which is fine i am and smoke more every day than them) except theyre at their moms house with no plan or goals for the future. which is fine too at 19 not a lot of people actually know what they want. its just the fact that they never cared and now theyre 23 and still doing the same shit not progressing in life and its sad to watch life pass them by while i progress with mine. ive had to stop hanging with them because i was only encouraging theyre lifestyle. i could go on and on about how little they help themselves but ill stop here and just say im sure theyll figure it out. weed doesnt make you a loser but smoking and playing video games is a hell of an easy and really fast way to let the days pass you by without noticing. oh yeah i forgot to mention i offered them their dream job of growing and starting a disp but they refused because ""I have better things to do with my time than grow weed"" even though they fiend for a g off me every time they see me. turns out they didnt want to work they just want to own a bunch of weed to smoke all day. all the work and effort i put into my plants will not go to that attitude to be ""enjoyed"" by those who lack respect for work and art.

So NOW you are saying that Montana only had to get by the Redskins and the Giants were not an obstacle?

And you are saying this because foxsports produced a list saying this?  You are basing your entire definition of dynasties on a list of 9, most of which never overlapped?

your second list doesn't have last year included and lists the Steelers dynasty Brady had to overcome in it.

Again, describe how Montana had tougher competition?

&gt; and the Giants team was more well rounded and had more championship success than the Colts

Based on....  what?

When Montana had to face the Giants, they made the playoffs 6 years and missed it 4 years (with 3 losing records).

The Colts made it 10 years and missed the playoffs once (and had one losing record).

How were the Giants 'more well rounded'?  They both made 2 SBs and the giants won 2 and the colts one (giants winning one by 1 point after a missed FG). 

Actually provide some level of logic/stats/analysis instead of just saying they were.

5443,"Your 'fact' does not take into account population growth since 1990. Moreover the quote from your article is clear:

&gt;Several such shootings took place also in 2016, but the overall rate of deadly violence in Sweden is still about 1 per 100,000 inhabitants...

Here are some official statistics. 

&gt;In absolute figures, an average of 80 persons per 
year were victims of lethal violence from 2010-2014, as compared with 95 
persons from 2000-2004 and an average of 107 persons from 1990-1994. 

https://i.imgur.com/FaVJx6g.png

Now the pertinent part:

&gt;Taken as a whole, lethal violence specifically with firearms has neither increased  nor  decreased  since  the  1990s.  There  was  an  average  of  slightly  fewer  than  20  victims  per  year  of  such  violence  in  the  beginning  of  the  1990s  as  well  as  in  the  beginning  of  the  2000s  and  the  beginning  of  the  2010s. There has, however, been a clear structural change in this lethal violence. In major metropolitan counties, there has been a continuous increase in  the  number  and  percentage  of  cases  which  occurred  in  the  context  of  
criminal conflicts where illegal handguns (pistols, revolvers) were used. At the same time, there has been a tangible decrease in the number and percentage of cases which take place in contexts other than criminal conflicts (for example, partner violence) outside of major metropolitan counties and with  legal  hunting  weapons  and  other  two-handed  weapons.  This  trend  means that criminal conflicts in major metropolitan counties came to represent  almost  half  of  all  cases  of  lethal  violence  with  firearms  in  Sweden  in the beginning of the 2010s, as compared with just under 20 per cent in the beginning of the 1990s, and that the number of men among all victims has increased while the number of women has decreased. The use of lethal 
firearm violence in the context of criminal conflicts has increased most in the counties of Skåne and Västra Götaland, while the level of such cases has more or less remain unchanged in Stockholm County when seen over the long-term. This difference means that Skåne and Västra Götaland are the only counties where lethal violence with firearms has increased overall in relation to population growth in the 1990s and 2000s.

https://i.imgur.com/XkJ5eJ5.png

Now, the most pertinent part:

&gt;One can see a high percentage of unemployed persons 
among the victims of other types of lethal violence as well, but the percent-
age  is  particularly  high  in  respect  of  victims  of  lethal  firearm  violence  in  
the  2000s.  A  considerably  high  percentage  of  lethal  firearm  violence  also  
took place in the most socially vulnerable areas of the major metropolitan 
counties (URBAN areas), where the residents’ socioeconomic resources are 
significantly less than those of the population on average. 

https://i.imgur.com/hWcrIqa.png

&gt;It  is  also  important  to  point  out  that  lethal  firearm  violence  which  takes  
place  in  the  context  of  criminal  conflicts  in  large  cities  still  constitutes  a  
limited  percentage  of  all  lethal  violence.  In  absolute  numbers,  such  cases  
increased from approximately 3 or 4 per year during the 1990s to approx-
imately 8 per year in the beginning of the 2010s. In other words, 9 out of 
10 cases of lethal violence in Sweden take place in other contexts.

5460,"You're still missing the point

all the female examples you've listed are women who play traditionally masculine roles, can't you see it? Arya, Meera, Brienne, Lyanna, they're all a bunch of tomboys, aren't they? And apart from Arya and say, Brienne, they're all way too minor to even make an impact on the viewership.

Basically the only leading female characters on the show are Sansa, Daenerys, Arya and Cersei. Arya is 100% a warrior semi-psychopath tomboy who just murders people at will, Cersei is Tywin 2.0, crazy af and murders people at will. The writers have gone to great lengths to tells us just how masculine they are, and how much they don't like ""girls"" (remember Arya disguising as a boy or saying shit like ""girls are stupid"", or Cersei blathering on and on about being Tywin's true son or whatever?)

Sansa and Daenerys instead are both very feminine characters (which doesn't mean weak) who have feminine concerns, act feminine and generally follow a ""feminine moral compass"": Daenerys is a Mother (of Dragons, of slaves, etc.), Sansa is the archetypal young Lady who wants to protect her family. Edit for clarification: I don't think people hate feminine characters *because* they're feminine, what I think is that characters who embody generally feminine traits just get given *a lot* less leeway than masculine female characters or men (e.g. all the actual murderers and psychopaths who get a big cheer every time they appear on screen) and get criticised a lot more and a lot louder for whatever opinion they express.

Like, it's just obvious that at least part of the vitriol aimed at Sansa and Daenerys has its roots in some kind of misogyny but ymmv I guess",gameofthrones

Well heirloom gear is going to hard-scale anyway and still make the content easier by a mile... now say we buff said bosses or mobs to fit the damage that heirlooms push out... Well now you've alienated those who don't use heirlooms and their contribution still means little to nothing.

So really, if someone wants to just level ... I mean do quests until you get quests for said dungeon, do the dungeon and don't touch LFD tool until you get another quest for those dungeons.

There's no other solution to this problem because heirlooms will always trivialize older content. Wiping on content that is supposed to be helping you level isn't fun. It's wasted exp and time, even for a newer player.

Also ... I think it's safe to assume as a general rule of thumb that every expansion from now on is going to have a boost ten levels below current max, so if they want to experience the same content that everyone else is then it's easy enough to use the boost.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5b0ed0597fdf476cac48fc7c64f264be.png)  

&gt; Sade (pronounced ""shah-day"") is a Grammy-winning British smooth jazz band named after their lead singer Sade Adu. The band's music features elements of jazz, funk, soul and rnb. 

&gt; Sade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latino-soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.

&gt; Sade Adu, the band's singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.

&gt; Around 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a Latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.

&gt; In May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.

&gt; Their debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.

&gt; Sade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.

&gt; Sade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.

&gt; Sade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: ""When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it."" Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band's open-minded approach to music. ""And that's the best thing we've achieved.""

&gt; Soldier of Love, Sade's first official studio album since the multi-platinum release of Lovers Rock in 2000, was released on 8th February, 2010. 

&gt; Sade is also two piece stoner rock from Prague, Czech republic. Released one MC. Read more on Last.fm.

5611,"Why do all three warlock specs feel more fun than at the start to you?

We still have tedious mechanics through the board. Far too much RNG, ELT, Reap and demonic empowerment as boring but required maintenance buffs, random shards, all our (used to be baseline) movement/control spells are in the same talent row, all in all we still have too little influence on our performance and we're still bound to specific pets and are missing the baseline interrupt. (Also RIP grimoire of sac). 

Warlocks for me feel like they used to be great, then they had to be changed for whatever reason and now they try to revert the damage they did step by step back to where we started.

I feel basically the exact opposite as you do. I love legion for the general content but I get to hate the specs. Being accessible is absolutely ok. But in SO many cases depth was entirely substituted by RNG. 

Look at ele shamans, easy to learn, sure. The difference between a good and a great ele is RNG anyway. I still think static overload for example feels cool and looks cool. But once you're trying to be competitive you rely on a 10% chance. There's nothing ""hard"" to master about it. It's praying to the dice. Sure, there's still a difference between a bad and a good ele.. But it takes not that much time to go from a bad to a good understanding of the  spec and then you're looking at that wall.

Exactly the same situation with outlaw (RtB), arms (CS), enhance (SS), sin (BoT), destro (Mastery/Shards), havoc (Fury gen) etc. 

Also all fluff was pruned from the classes for exactly no reasons. Maybe stuff like scare beast had to go because new players or whatever, but what about ""fancy skills"" like eye of the beast that did nothing but being immersive? Removing them was simply removing a part of the fun. As someone who PvPs a lot the homogenization and the simplificated toolkits were a damn hard hit for the game mode. I'm feeling like most games I play are on autopilot, with less interactions I can make my decisionmaking simply isn't that skill dependent. I play my PvE rotation and wait for the right time to drop a CC/CD. Rest of my performance is decided by factors I can't control and the ever swinging balance-pendulum.

I'm happy for you that you have fun with the classes. Again, the easy to learn part is a thing I also absolutely welcome. The bad thing is that the ""hard to master""-part is mostly missing and subsitituted by things we have little to no control about. Taking away skill ceilings and replacing them by RNG is a thing that they'll hopefully get rid of in the future.

Personally class design is the one single worst point of legion for me.

Labour is a commodity like any other. For example, if Canada was a closed economy, I think we can both agree that the introduction of mass automation in industries that continue to be very human-heavy would concentrate wealth in the owners of that capital, all else being equal. Money must be transferred from the owners of that money to the factors of production (of which one is traditionally labour) in order to produce. I think we can also agree that labour is one of two primary ways that money is transferred from one person to another in this country, since labour is simply a special type of sale (and even then, not all that special--it's subject to the same forces as every other normal good).

So, my concern is not for the health of the Canadian economy as a whole, but for the economic health of the median citizen. Free trade widens the economic gap between the holders of capital and their means of production--in this case, Canadian business owners and Chinese employees, rather than the old relationship of Canadian business owners and Canadian employees.

Is it possible that newly unemployed Canadians will find themselves a place in the new Canadian economy under that arrangement? Of course. But Canada has a price floor for labour--the options are ""at least minimum wage"" or ""$0"", and China's average wage is between 1/5th and 1/14th of that price floor. So, failing some sort of massive demand for domestic labour in the Canadian economy that will be created under the arrangement (which I really don't see happening), I fail to see how higher profits for Canadian firm owners and lower prices for imported goods can benefit a Canadian that is now making $0.",canada

Actually the proof is here: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/gop-voters-love-same-attack-on-syria-they-hated-under-obama.html

&gt;37 percent of Democrats back Trump’s missile strikes. In 2013, 38 percent of Democrats supported Obama’s plan. That is well within the margin of error.

&gt;How about Republicans? Well, that’s a wildly different picture:

&gt;In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, a Washington Post–ABC News poll found that only 22 percent of Republicans supported the U.S. launching missile strikes against Syria in response to Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons against civilians.

&gt;A new Post-ABC poll finds that 86 percent of Republicans support Donald Trump’s decision to launch strikes on Syria for the same reason. Only 11 percent are opposed.

Not my fault you refuse to accept it for reasons yet to be disclosed.

How about your position? Are you going to show any proof that backs your position?

&gt;2 - Who in the Trump admin was lying? And about what? Again, where is the proof of collusion?

About collusion with Russia. From the correspondence provided by Trump Jr.:

5751,"&gt; Speaking of D.Va the only reason she's ever picked is Defense Matrix.

DM is her biggest strength, but not her only boon. She's a flex tank that is compatible with point tanks. In the current dive setup, she does a mix of damage dealing with Winston and acting as a check to Pharah, Soldier, McCree, Reaper, and so on. She's bulky and is strong at claiming high ground from characters that depend on that positioning. It's why the better players you see do a mix of playing defensively and aggressively.

Likewise, Tracer's entire kit and attributes completes her, not Just Blink, despite it being her most valued ability. Blink gives her a strong neutral, while Recall gives her a limited amount of self-sustainability and Pulsebomb fits her fast-paced playstyle, being effective at discreetly killing healers or wounding tanks. Roadhog, however, had all his attributes loaded into offense, particularly getting quick picks off key targets. His weapon was slow, had a low magazine, and, being a shotgun-based weapon, means his damage is inconsistent and limited in range.

On paper, his hook is still valuable for displacing targets, but the problem arises when he hooks targets that survive and can disengage. When you have a pool of characters with as much potential as tanks, there's a lot more competition and players are more likely to opt for tanks that are either self-sufficient or more consistent.

In order to fit in, Roadhog will need to be stronger without his hook, and the RoF/Mag size changes to Scrap Gun are a start. If he's able to better perform outside landing hooks, he'll be more consistent, as missing that hook won't leave him completely gimped. As it stands, he'll probably need more love, but his adjustments ""make sense"", at the very least.",Overwatch

&gt;You stupid americans are all wrong. Bloke is simply a British slang term for 'man/guy', with perhaps slight connotations of masculinity, and used only in an informal setting. Unlike 'guy' it is not normally used vocatively, as in 'hey you blokes'.

5770,"Oh my God. You actually just argued that wealth is zero sum. It isn't, objectively. No one earning something precludes others from earning something. That just isn't how any of this works. Wealth is constantly being *created*.

There is no ""malignancy of billionaires."" There's a massive issue with the government limiting working class access to work. 

Another comment I have related:

&gt;We should be removing barriers for wealth creation on the working class. Instead people who think their one economics class makes them an expert want to do the absolute stupidest thing and jack up taxes in the rich. News flash, Canada can not afford to cause a wave of capital flight. France did it and has been trying to reverse it, to little avail considering they're still bleeding wealth. And that will come back to bite in the future. 

&gt;You know how you make income inequality worse? Do things that makes the barrier to entry into the economy harder for people, e.g. absurd minimum wage hikes to buy votes. Rather hilariously, and sadly since no one bothers to look, most of the people working minimum wage jobs are not actually the poor parents trying to feed their kids. Most are teenagers and college/university students, who tend to be dependents in a household already not poor. Or it's 20 somethings starting out in the work force, a minimum wage job is normal, and often older semi-retired people wanting a supplemental income or treating boredom. Poor people often have no reliable work, and a higher minimum wage **will** make their chances of getting work lower; or people who already make ~acceptable money, but are being crushed by debt/other responsibilities (like injury or addiction problems).

&gt;Bring in poor immigrants quite obviously does nothing to help, and companies are hardly going to do more low level work *in* Canada that can give a stable income source to the lower/lower middle class with high corporate taxes, astoundingly dumb utilities costs, etc. 

&gt;Our poorly convinced tax and welfare systems don't help to much either. Welfare systems **need** to be structured in a way that at least somewhat encourages working to get off of it. A negative income tax with entitlements clawed back over time at a lower, reasonable amount wouldn't be bad. Claw back benefits every 6 months that a person doesn't work (unless unable because of injury/disability, or occupied in education/job training).

5774,"All 4 receivers are so different. Rice is the GOAT, but he played on an incredibly talented team that invented and utilized the WCO that took defenses years to figure out. Rice was great because he just outworked everybody, and wore defenses down with his work ethic. 

Moss was so naturally gifted, and was just a huge playmaker who should have been doubled more than he often was. You never really saw teams try to rough him up, which is also probably a testament to his talent, because he was to fast to get a hand on him. The guy could go up the ladder like nobody else.

Owens, took over games, made tough catches, and was just too physical to contain for most defenses. 

Julio is more beastly than any of these guys, because has some of each of their qualities.  The only thing that holds Julio back is his health. Julio is not fragile, but he's so high performance that he injures himself by stressing his body from the shear power that he processes. I don't know if Julio will have the career numbers like the other 3, because of his health and the way Ryan spreads the ball around so much, but he willl go down as probably the greatest Falcons receiver ever. He'll also probably make the HOF too from just being so popular and liked for the type of player he is. ",nfl

5787,"And so we should have a conversation about the context of such things. People simply dying from famine isn't genocide, but taking food from those people during famine after previously uprooting them from their good land and forcing them to move to rocky land or be murdered (amongst the 101 other things that happened over 800 years) *is* genocide. 

Likewise, saying Churchill caused the Bengal famine is just wrong, but a discussion about how he willingly allowed it to continue for longer than it needed to is  a possible discussion to be had where both sides can make valid points. 

Like any historical conversation, people either like to ignore the parts that make their own look bad or simply aren't made aware of them (because they make their own look bad). Most Brits I've spoken to aren't aware Churchill sent his own version of Gestapo (Black and Tans) to Ireland to murder and rape their way around the country ""to keep the rebels down"", who committed these atrocities knowing they were sanctioned to roam free and do as they like. 

I genuinely believe Churchill was an evil man who only has a positive reputation because someone more evil happened to pop up in his time and make him look good. You might think I'm a misinformed nut job, and that's OK, because we could have a good debate about it and people would read our comments and make their own decisions.

Maybe, but Jon is understandably not concerned with uniting the kingdoms against the WWs at this very moment.  His focus is on the imminent arrival of the WW army at the Wall and how to defend/survive against it.  Jon certainly does not need advice from Sansa about how to unite the North and prepare the defenses.

Sansa advice in this first episode was really shortsighted and rudely given, in my opinion.  When it comes to King's Landing and Cersei she probably does have some valuable insight to give but the way she forced it on him now and tut-tut'd him (publicly, no less) works against her.

6076,"&gt; (emphasis mine). IF. They don't though.

They do. Here's the Netherlands : Judges are appointed by the Crown, under the aegis of the Minister for Security and Justice. Only Dutch nationals can be appointed to the office of judge. Candidates must hold a law degree from a Dutch university.

I'm not entirely familiar with the Polish law and how it would exactly work, but a lot of the systems require the Minister of Justice to make judicial appointments. This is exactly what the problem is here, isn't it? I mean, I'm aware that the international narrative is pushed differently, but is there are real substantial reason for that? This system is a matter of constitutional legal basis for Poland, and regardless of which party is in power, it will still be in place in this form. So the question is, is the narrative justified on the basis of the devised appointment system or is it something else?

&gt;sn't that what is being done? The other EU countries are saying that what Poland is trying to do won't fly.

Doesn't matter what they say or think. If objectively their systems doesn't hold itself to a higher degree, then the commonly held standard is a somewhat minimum level, a level which Poland would be legally satisfying. Article 7 requires there to be an infringement of those values. 

If Poland wishes to appeal against the invocation of Article 7, it goes to the CJEU. Then the CJEU needs to make an assessment of how the appointment happens in each state, and how that differs in this case for Poland. If the CJEU finds that there is no substantial and material difference between all the systems, and that it works essentially more or less the same, then Poland is deemed to have satisfied the basic requirements of democratic system and rule of law that is part of the EU acquis.

&gt; In a signal of deepening military cooperation between India, the United States and Japan, the three countries have deployed some of their largest warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean for an annual naval exercise that is conducted with an eye on China.

&gt; The naval drills have expanded in the last two years amid growing concerns over Chinese maritime assertiveness not just in South China Sea, but also in the Indian Ocean.

&gt; In recent months, the Indian Navy has recorded an unusual surge in the number of Chinese naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and tracked at least seven Chinese submarines entering the region since December 2013 according to military observers.

6193,"&gt; which of the sub-series is the best to get into first?

######Best:

1. [Fate/Stay Night](https://vndb.org/v11) Visual Novel.  
/r/fatestaynight has a guide for installing it iirc.  
Alternatively, you can read a text-based low-commentary lets play on [lparchive](http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night/) (Just ignore any cursive text not starting with ""Music:"").

After this, you can watch any Stay Night anime if you want. This includes [DEEN's anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n), [Ufotable's UBW anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue), and [Ufotable's upcoming HF movies](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fee). As you have already experienced these in the VN, the order isn't really important, and if you don't like one, you can drop it without worry.

2\. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)


######Anime-only 1:

1. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)  
Prequel to Fate/Stay Night. If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. The first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.

2. [Fate/Stay Night DEEN](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n) ???  
You can leave this one out if you don't like it. It's the adaption of the Fate route, which set the fundamentals for what's to come in the other two routes. Though I don't remember whether that's true for the anime as well.  

3. [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue)  
If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. Just like Fate/Zero, the first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.

4. [Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fe) (not yet released)

---

People usually recommend the second anime-only order over the first, but I don't think it's really that important. I'd say, it depends on which kind of anime you prefer. Zero is more mature with professional characters who know what they are doing, but also constant switching between the characters, while Stay Night is the school anime with the morally white highschool protagonist who is a noob at magic and just stumbles into the battle royale.  

If you want to go with the order that's usually recommended (the second), make sure you're ready to wait with Zero until the HF movies have been fully released (or read that part of the VN).  
**DO NOT INSERT FATE/ZERO INBETWEEN TWO STAY NIGHT ROUTES.**

 Although I enjoyed it, I don't see myself watching it multiple times like many of Nolan's other films.

I may be wrong so someone could correct me, but IIRC, it's like a DDOS attack, but instead of on a player, it's on the server running that match you were in.  Since that server can't function, the game can't be recorded, so it ends up just acting like it never existed.

However, there is a way to stay in the game, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/34qlw2/drophacks_are_becoming_much_more_frequent_even_in/cqxff1w/) tells how to possibly stay in the game to finish:

&gt; Just to let you guys know there's a simple method to minimize the effect drophacking has. When a drophacking attempt on a game is obvious (like when you're pushing down the nexus and suddenly everyone dcs) don't quit the game to try to reconnect. Instead just spam click like you would when moving your character. Doing this never dcs you from the game and the game never ends. So long as you do this longer than the drophacker decides to do his thing then you can still win the game. I did this the other day clicking for 30 minutes until the drophacking stopped and finished off the game.",leagueoflegends

6342,"Clothes really do make the person when it comes to the initial stages of human encounters.  A sense of personal style not only makes the individual more confident but people like to see stimulating things and what else can they go by than how you look (well kept skin and hair and decent physique) and what you wear.  We are an instant gratification society - if you want to increase your odds with the opposite sex, develop a swagger (take bits and pieces from people you admire cosmetically) through clothes/style/passions and cultivate it with your core personality.

I always know many outer circle friends (male and female) that are cool, not ugly (not many people are truly ugly), great personality, ambitious; most of the traits that everyone looks for in suitors.  However, while they are in general clean people (as far as I know); they just do not care about clothes/fashion and making any form of statement with what they wear.  They rationalize and say ""It's just clothes - if a girl/guy likes me it will be for the right reasons and not what I'm wearing"" -- that is a common and false statement so many people live by to their own detriment.

So dressing 'clean and with your own swagger-style' and being confident in who you are (its a cliche but love yourself before you can love someone else is so true) will allow you to mingle with whomever you desire at any point in your journey.  As you work on these things, you'll naturally frequent places where other like-minded suitors will also be enticed to visit.",AskReddit

It's more about self-respect than happiness. If you have problems you're ignoring because you think the ""right person"" coming into your life will fix everything, then you're not taking care of yourself, you're not fulfilling your own needs. 

But if you're dealing with it, taking your meds, going to therapy, working on whatever needs working on, then you're going to be more proud of yourself, and feel like you've got it handled.

1. The suggestion that the UK would still have a judge in the ECJ after Brexit. No reason to expect this to be the case, and no way we could formally require it to be the case, since even as it stands, the custom of approving one judge from each member state is just that, a custom, not a rule. Once the UK ceases to be a member state, there is no reason to expect a British ECJ judge, when no 3rd country has ever been able to select a judge for the ECJ (nor, for that matter have the EEA members that Barnier recently confused for 3rd countries)

2. He makes out that an arbitration body would be some sort of colossal diplomatic undertaking that would be almost impossible to organise, despite similar bodies existing for pretty much every FTA in the world. 'It might have to sit continuously' is presented as if turning up to work every week is some sort of absurd and unreachable goal which nobody could ever expect of a court. He also tries to conflate the total workload of the ECJ with the much smaller portion which would relate to disputes between the UK and EU.

He also seems to just assume that May is confusing the two european courts without any evidence. He never really backs up the assertion beyond 'they've both annoyed her as home sec'",europe

&gt; Norman Greenbaum (born 20th November 1942, Malden, Massachusetts) is a U.S.  singer-songwriter.

&gt; He is best known for writing and performing his hit song  ""Spirit in the Sky"", which sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970. Though Greenbaum is generally regarded as a one-hit wonder; several of his records placed prominently in the charts. In 1968, under the name Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, he recorded the novelty hit ""The Eggplant That Ate Chicago"".

&gt; Greenbaum's initial interest in music was sparked by southern blues music and the folk music that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He performed with various bands in high school and studied music at Boston University for two years. In college he performed at local coffeehouses but eventually dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1965. Read more on Last.fm.

For me, it had better plot progression than in any film that I've seen before; The way that it builds off of the initial premise and introduces twists and turns into the narrative is superb. This film took me on a ride the whole time, and it was by far the most intense film-watching experience I've had in a while (I had to take a breather around the mid-point because of the emotional intensity). The way it twists your expectations and captivates the audience is really something.

And when the ending finally arrived, I still didn't want it to end.

The cost of health-care has skyrocketed in every developed nation, partly because of technology, expectations and demographics.

For example, people today want MRIs, which are safe (no ionizing radiation) but require massive capital purchases. The entire healthcare sector had digitized, and though it raised efficiency it involved a massive capital outlay, and expensive maintenance costs. Not to mention baby boomer generation retiring needed increased healthcare. 

Show me one credible study (not something you pulled up from some SJW kook site) that links any of those to NAFTA. One. Rising health-care costs are a global trend.

When you drop one cup into another, you have to displace the air inside the receiving cup.  As the dropping cup enters into the receiving cup, the amount of space becomes less than the air can efficiently escape, thereby causing compressed air (which is an area of high pressure).

By spinning the cup, you cause the air to also spin within the high pressure area, But are also pulling in air, due to the shape of the cups, allowing the pressure differential to last longer than if there were no spin.

Then he blows into the area where the air is escaping (along a tangent that's prograde to the spin).  This adds more air volume into the compressed air, eventually creating enough pressure differential to lift the cup, which moves away from where he was blowing at.",funny

1 - Retribution buff uptime, 20% extra damage when someone dies, when people learn the fights etc the uptime of this buff will drop drastically, if you check the top pala logs most have a large amount of up time on this buff.

2 - Poor mobility, every other mele (expect DKs) have pretty good movement, however as a pala you need to spec into have good movement, which generally is a bad option as Divine intervention is such a powerful talent for 2 reasons its lets you basically get a free death and secondly reduces the CD of bubble, so you can cheese certain things ie during sisters Mythic i bubble'd the moonbeam off.

3 - This is biggest problem, Crusade. Crusade is the best CD in the game, by far (as confirmed by blizz) outside of crusade ret is basically useless so if anything happens during crusade which requires you to stop hitting the boss (meteor on goroth, gladiator kiting on harjatan etc etc) even for 5/6 seconds you lose a massive amount of dps.

I grew up just outside an indian reservation. The elementary school I went to was 90% native and I am white. Of those 90% probably half were told every day of their life that the white man is the reason their life sucked. I do not remember a day where I was not fighting 3-4 of them that were 1-2 years older than me. I was ALWAYS bleeding at school for YEARS. School didn't do shit. Right before middle school (when I was the biggest fish in the pond) a group of them came up and started the usual fare of talking shit about white people. Dumbass said I could use my white privilege and swing first, so I grabbed a lunchroom chair and beat him within an inch of his life infront of his friends. I guess they were shocked but eventually a teacher came and pulled the chair (and me still trying to punch the kid) away. I was suspended and the parents tried to sue for medical expences. The judge said the parents didn't have to pay a dime for their kids treatment and my parents had already paid their family enough through taxes (he was super racist...) I was sent to a special needs school since it was my first major offense (and the judge, again, was suuuuuper racist) and from that point on I never had a problem with being bullied. Ended up in a normal high school after moving and slowly realized how abnormal my elementary school experience was. Its hard to feel bad for the kid but after a few years I realized just about the only reason I didn't end up in Juvenile hall was because I was white. Still wish that res would burn to the ground though...

6608,"&gt; On the first point, the point I'm making is that one of the reasons Colon has been so durable and consistent is precisely because he doesn't throw 95. So yes, those guys are better on a per inning basis, but who cares if they can't stay healthy enough to pitch as many innings as Colon?


And my point was, what if those injuries were freak accidents, not because they were injury prone?

Look at Colon's career before 2012: plenty of seasons where he didn't even manage 100 innings and plenty of injuries.

Look at other pithers that throw 95 and don't have injury histories, or ones that throw about as hard as Bartolo and do have plenty of injuries — including Keuchel, who's not really a flamethrower.

Sometimes injuries are just flukes.

&gt; On the second point, this just highlights what WAR is measuring. Who cares who's the better pitcher or throws harder or whatever. Just concentrate on actual contribution. 

Sure, and on a per inning or per game basis, Bartolo contributes less.

&gt; By that measure, if you know the future, you would obviously select the guy you know for a fact will contribute more. 

Pointless hypothetical. If you know the future, you pick the guy you know is better and do everything in your power to prevent injury so they can continue to contribute.

&gt; Saying Colon isn't as good as these other guys misses the point. The original point was he is underrated, and the support for that assertion was that he ranks 23rd since 2012 in one popular measure of contribution (this by the way includes his crap performance this season).

And you seem to have missed my point that by rWAR — a measure that tells you how they actually performed rather than how good they were at limiting walks and home runs while getting strikeouts and infield fly balls like fWAR, those players were all more valuable than Bartolo in that time except for Gerrit Cole, which is probably because he didn't even pitch in the majors in 2012.

How does fact that he's 23rd in fWAR in that time frame prove that he's underrated? It doesn't make him the 23rd best pitcher in baseball in that time or that he even contributed the 23rd most wins among pitchers. It means he has the 23rd best combination of strikeouts, walks, infield flies, and home runs for the formula.",baseball

What's the point in using money when its completely in the hands of the 1% and they just give us a few sheckles to keep us temporarily satisfied while they loot our economy.

6696,"When I was 7 years old, I lived in NJ.  My granddad was a big baseball fan, and had this love/hate relationship with the Yankees.  Like he was born in Greenwich Village in the 1920's, and lived upstate a bit and loved the Yankees since childhood.  But then Steinbrenner bought them and he just *HATED* steinbrenner, but still simultaneously loved the Yanks.  

I watched his fandom and the ups and downs he had in the 80's, snd it was confusing to me as a small child.  Then in a magical year, the METS beat the Red Sox in the world series, and in strange, improbable fashion.  The ONLY baseball thing my granddad hated more than George Steinbrenner was the freakin' Boston Red Sox.  So he was understandably gleeful at this turn of events, so I sort of 7-year-old bandwagon hopped on the Mets train.  

I figured all my friends (who were universally Yankees fans) were in for years of disappointment and failure - I was sure to be on the right side of history!  As a side note, I now have 3 kids and live in Virginia and they are all Nationals fans.  I could not force Mets fandom upon them, as that would be grounds for child protective services to be called.

Now I am a 38 year old Mets fan, and I am pretty sure that there is a God, and there is a Devil, and they made a Job-like pact to screw around with the Mets fanbase as a test of our faithfulness.  It's worse than being consistently bad.  It's like, here is a taste of potential greatness, then it gets yoinked right away.

That's just a bad arguement.

Reddit also isn't the government. r/soccer banning tabloids minimizes exposure here, nothing more. And if the mods, or the community as whole, decides that tabloids are nothing but a negative influence on this subreddit they ought to be banned.

6734,"But also let's not forget the differences in perception that come from doing that work. That **drastically** affects supply and demand.

In general, female porn stars are more likely to get shamed for having been in porn, or creepy behavior towards them. Male porn stars are more likely to get high fives. Not to mention that it's far rarer for the male porn star to get mentioned by name or otherwise really noted. That's bad if your goal is fame or success, but great for those who might worry about how others will treat them. Slipping into obscurity is easier. Your past career (or that one thing you did in college because you were broke and needed food) won't likely follow you around.

Arguably we should avoid and reduce the stigma related to porn, but we can't deny that as it is, such a stigma does exist and that heavily influences the likelihood of anyone wanting to do porn. And this is so evident even here on Reddit, where there's dozens of comments from straight men about how they'd totally do porn, but far, far fewer women are so interested (heck, there's no shortage of guys saying that they'd do it for free).",worldnews

Sure, the transport going from ""the tower"" to the text messaging server has ample capacity for texting.  (Usually.  Unless it has a T1 backhaul)  And maybe the text messaging server would only cost about $2,000 for the hardware and runs linux.

There's usually a middle man gouging both parties.  These middlemen are also the reason roaming data costs so damn much.  Whether the cost of intercarrier texting justifies increasing the cost of all messages or not, who knows.

6773,"This is a really short clip, so it's impossible to say whether you have good aim or not in general. But, we'll work with what we have-- let's go through every single shot! We'll look at what it was, how you did it, and what we can glean from it.

* ***headshot*** on Rein - video starts here - You hit him right as he begins his charge, so he's pretty much standing still.
* **bodyshot** on Rein - flicked, low charge - Since he's charging, you know where he's going and how fast.
* *miss* Rein (hit car) - flicked and moved back - You hesitated for a second here. You start by predicting Rein, but then you waver left and flick to the right. It looks like you weren't sure whether you should keep going for the Reinhardt or go for the Soldier/Zen to his left? Since Rein had your teammate pinned, killing him before he hits the wall should have been your priority.
* **bodyshot** on Rein (kills him) - preaimed while unscoped, low charge and flick that continues to the right -  At this point, Rein already killed your Winston. If you haven't missed the prior shot, he'd still be alive. 
* ***headshot*** on Widow - preaimed while unscoped, reticle at head   height, strafed to line up shot - This was a good shot. You saw the other Widow's trail after she shot at you and used it to your advantage. You were also lucky that she strafed into your reticle, but your crosshair positioning is still what made that possible.
* *miss* Zen - flicked while strafing  - You tried to shoot where you thought he would be, which is good. Most of your time was also spent moving your focus from the top window to the left choke. You probably could have been a bit more patient with your aiming.
* *miss* Zen (already dead) - flicked again even though he was in the same general area - It was probably muscle memory from flicking, but there was no need to move your mouse as wildly as you did here. He died in a huge explosion though, so who knows if you would've hit him or not.
* *miss* Soldier - flicked, overshot to where he was, not where he was going to be - He was also jumping at the end of a sprint, not necessarily your fault.
* ***headshot*** on Torb - kept reticle at head(ish) height, reacted when he appeared - Really good shot. You knew they were going to be coming through that choke from spawn. It's kind of lucky that it was Torb, since anyone else would've been a bodyshot. But still good game sense and reaction time.
* **????shot** on Soldier - ??? - It's hard to tell since the visuals stop here, but it sounds like you killed the Soldier as he was hacked and running away? 

Just based on this clip alone, I'd say:

* Your reactive aiming can use some work. 
* You're good at shooting things that are either standing more or less still (headshot on Rein, second bodyshot on Rein, headshot on Widow) or moving predictably (first bodyshot on Rein, headshot on Torb). I know how that sounds, but lots of people find even this difficult, so good job!
* It's hard to tell since this is such a short clip, but I think your game sense is pretty good. You know that Widow can do more work off the point when the enemy needs to contest it instead of you, you targeted the Rein while he was vulnerable (charging), you prioritized the enemy Widow as soon as she shot at you, you know that most enemies will have to walk through that choke and pre-aimed accordingly. The only thing that could've been better game sense-wise was when you hesitated killing the Rein to save your Winston. It was a split second thing but that counts.

If you want to get better at aiming with hitscan, here are some resources:

* [Overwatchdojo's McCree Aim Drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gosylYPQR6M) - this entire channel is great tbh
* [Kephrii's Widowmaker Warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG1pk8ifhSk) 

Note that both of the above were made before the custom games lobby was introduced. They're good for warming up before matches, but don't do them for hours every day. The training bots have predictable movement and weird hitboxes. 

* [ioStux's commentary on how to practice aiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeBzBlompys) - lots of info, take it with a grain of salt, but interesting and good to know

That night was the final straw. She had me help her move into a new apartment (I was already pissed that we missed out on watching fireworks). It was after 11:00 PM and I knew that we were making too much noise hauling furniture up the stairs. Sure enough, one of the neighbors complained and I told her of this. She then got shitty with me over suggesting that she quiet it down.

It was still hot and I was sweaty, tired and irritable. Having had enough of her shit I lost it and told her to fuck off once and for all. She continued yelling at me as I made my way to the pickup and drove off, spinning gravel and peeling out as I was extremely furious.

Having taken leave of my senses I was driving recklessly through the neighborhood where the streets were narrow and lined with parked cars. I must have been going at least 60 mph. When I approached the main cross street I slammed on the brakes. I skidded through the intersection, and as luck would have it, I did it right as a cop was approaching, so he saw it all happen.

Knowing that I was in trouble, I slowly and calmly made my way back to my newly-ex-girlfriend's apartment. He had the lights on, of course, as he followed me until I stopped about three blocks later. I was arrested for reckless driving. I spent about two hours in the holding cell until I was bailed out.

With the help of an attorney I got the charge reduced to inattentive driving, which meant not having to do jail time, paying a lesser fine and taking a lighter hit to my driving record.

I upvoted you simply because I'm taking your question as if it was tongue in cheek and answering it with a massive pile of good, or at least simply catchy pop punk.

[Relient K](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvz0J0WBZPE) is still going strong, although they're a bit Christian. Check out their album Mhmm if you like old blink.

[The Ataris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTfqXTZAasQ) used to have a poppy sound like that too. Their album Anywhere But Here is rather unknown in the public, but is niche-famous.

A more mature approach to a similar vibe is [Motion City Soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ySfoFAb_-0). Musically, they're just more complex and the singing is way superior. Check out their album Commit This to Memory first, but it's all good. Justin Pierre, their lead songwriter, is currently doing a side project called Farewell Continental that I absolutely LOVE. There's very little little [youtube material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYW1x3DH5k), but their album is on amazon and the usual breakfast and question related sharing communities. I will not confirm nor deny my responsibility for the latter. edit: [found this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyNfQCwfkc&amp;feature=related)

Fall Out Boy's album Take This To Your Grave basically gave balls to the blink sound, and it's what made that band famous. I was sad they moved in a different direction after that.

Sum 41 is obvious.

I can't believe I missed this one... MEST. Check out Mest. Check out [Jaded (These Years)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDlAl07cFMI) and [Rooftops](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJbKo1gkUGg).

Along those lines there were also Punchline, Saves The Day, [American Hi-Fi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAmINmjpQxw), Good Charlotte, Wakefield, [Yellowcard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8RyDJGAZ2o), [McFly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h76uVRSJ5bc), and Son of Dork.

[Man Overboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7WJ5TVJAw4) took their band's name from [a Blink song title (the only studio track on their live album, The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u38TqU5rAyk)

Also check out No Use For A Name, Gatsby's American Dream, Lifetime, Jawbreaker, Descendants, Bad Religion, Pennywise, Millencolin, Rise Against, No Trigger, and A Wilhelm Scream.

7035,"There is no more hilarious and delusional of a meme than the Rebel is antisemetic.  You could not be more wrong.

There has to be a thousand reasons to be against them.  One of their correspondents is a plagiarist.  Another correspondant rushed the stage at a play.  A former correspondant got arrested blocking a refugee ship.  Levant has been successfully sued for libel when that's a very high standard to meet.  The clickbait.  The divisive rhetoric.  The constant stunts.  The overall inanity of their political leanings.  Their extremist anti-Islam rhetoric, given while they're not antisemetic, they are DEFINITELY anti-Islam. 

Yet people keep coming back to this idea that the Rebel is so antisemetic and it's absolutely bizarre to me.  It has to be pretty much the weakest possible way people commonly attack the Rebel.  It is one thing they are not.  Anti-Semites denounce The Rebel as lugenpresse that is an example of the Jewish conspiracy to take over both sides of the media, which push pro-Israel rhetoric wrapped in a message appealing to the right wing, often saying they're libertarian Canadians that are much too centrist on top of that.  

Antisemites hate them because they know that The Rebel is dangerous to the cause of antisemitism. They are a cannon against antisemitism, because they're not people worried about appearing politically correct to virtue signal, they don't care about crossing uncrossable lines like how you're never ever allowed to say something critical of Jews, allowing them to actually get through to confused young men, and push a resoundingly pro-Jewish message, because they're willing to cross lines that will make these alt-right guys actually listen to them.

I really cannot think of many more effective organisations against antisemitism than The Rebel, certainly they're more effective than every liberal organisation at countering antisemetic propaganda, and it never ceases to outstand me how people can be so blind to not understand what they are doing.  They just look at how some antisemites watch The Rebel, they see some clickbait videos, and that's all they need to know, just look skin deep and write them off as antisemites.  If there is one virtuous thing about The Rebel its that they make pro-semetic causes look cool to the right wing anti-PC crowd.  Yet people seem to be so confused about what they are, they confuse their greatest virtue for their greatest moral failing.",canada

We're not paying Khadr for all the hardship he's experienced in his entire life, just for the value of the specific charter/human rights violations the Canadian government is responsible for. In sure in every other case there were other parties who contributed in some way to the situation, but that's not what's assessed. This isn't some negligence case where there's blame apportioned out as a percentage of some total loss, it's direct compensation for the specific violations committed by our government. We are in no way paying him to make up for him becoming a child soldier, for his injuries in Afghanistan, as reparations for all the torture he suffered at the hands of the Americans. We're only paying for the specific violations we committed. 

&gt;But in the cases you're trying to draw a comparison with, Canada was 100% the only party to blame, and we still barely paid out this much cash to them.

Not true at all. Many of these cases involved third parties who were partly or largely responsible. It's hard to envision someone saying that when a man is falsely imprisoned for murder, the actual murderer is not responsible in large degree for what happened to him, as he obviously would not have ended up in jail had that person not committed the murder, but that is totally irrelevant to the fact that the government is the one who violated his rights by falsely imprisoning him, and that's what the payout is for.

Trudeau would have been an idiot to take this to trial. Virtually all legal experts agree the payout would have likely been much higher had they done so. I prefer our government doesn't gamble with foxy million of taxpayer money. ",canada

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/ This article explores the issues and concludes that sensory dysfunction and systemic failure, manifested as autism, is the inevitable consequence arising from subtle DNA alteration and consequently from the overuse of vaccines.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/ In phase I, it was observed that there was a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of ASD reported following the Thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccine in comparison to the Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine. In phase II, it was observed that cases diagnosed with an ASD were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine administered within the first, second, and sixth month of life.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535 A positive and statistically significant relationship was found: The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033 The risk of autism among African American children vaccinated before the age of 2 years was 340% that of those vaccinated later.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277 The purpose of this review is to examine these six publications and analyze possible reasons why their published outcomes are so different from the results of investigations by multiple independent research groups over the past 75+ years.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534 Because many autistic children harbor elevated levels of measles antibodies, we conducted a serological study of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and MBP autoantibodies. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170 Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159 The increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades; and a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age. The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560 Between 12 and 24 mo of age, these previously normally developing children suffered mercury toxic encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106436 The overwhelming preponderance of the evidence favours acceptance that Hg exposure is capable of causing some ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774468/ The purpose of the present critical review is provide mechanistic insight regarding how limited thiol availability, abnormal sulfation chemistry, and decreased GSH reserve capacity in children with an ASD could make them more susceptible to the toxic effects of TM routinely administered as part of mandated childhood immunization schedules.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697751/ This suggests certain individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be highly susceptible to mitochondrial specific toxins like the vaccine preservative thimerosal.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355 Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation of the brain. The inflammation could be caused by a defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, the immune response of the mother to infection while pregnant, a premature birth, encephalitis in the child after birth, or a toxic environment.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21907498 Conjugate vaccines and autism.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848 A review of medical literature and US government data suggests that: (i) many cases of idiopathic autism are induced by early mercury exposure from thimerosal; (ii) this type of autism represents an unrecognized mercurial syndrome; and (iii) genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some children.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242 Children with ASDs were significantly more likely to have Rh-negative mothers than controls. Each ASD patient's mother was determined to have been administered a TCR during her pregnancy. The results provide insights into the potential role prenatal mercury exposure may play in some children with ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250 Conjugate vaccines may predispose children to autism spectrum disorders (explanation of a hypothesis) 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780490 The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving mercury toxicity.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322 Hair mercury levels in the autistic group were 0.47 ppm versus 3.63 ppm in controls, a significant difference. The mothers in the autistic group had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure through Rho D immunoglobulin injections and amalgam fillings than control mothers. Within the autistic group, hair mercury levels varied significantly across mildly, moderately, and severely autistic children, with mean group levels of 0.79, 0.46, and 0.21 ppm, respectively.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870260 Cultured lymphocytes from autistic children and non-autistic siblings up-regulate heat shock protein RNA in response to thimerosal challenge.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043938 A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142947 The role of mercury in the pathogenesis of autism.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675092 Thimerosal-treated mice exhibited neural development delay, social interaction deficiency, and inclination of depression. Apparent neuropathological changes were also observed in adult mice neonatally treated with thimerosal. ",conspiracy

Stop smoking 48 hours before your test.

After you have finished that first half gallon, start on the gatorade, drink about a quart the day before and take two multivatmins, one in the morning, one in the evening, same with the B12.  Wake up the day  of your test at least 3 hours before, drink the rest of the gatorade (NO WATER), take one multivamin as soon as you wake up, and one right before you leave to go to your test, same with the B12.  Now make sure you have pee'd at least 2 times the morning of the test (do not count your first pee of the morning.  So ideally the pee for your test should be your 4th pee of the day, make sure you are not holding it in.

I'm not sure about this (you can't really prove that the reason businesses prices went up is because of the HST), but if the HST goes away, I can almost promise that the prices won't drop.

He did what he was supposed to, what she told him to.  It's just that it was a huge mistake and she wished she could have taken it back, and it ended up contributing to her decision to kill herself.

You're taking that one scene out of context.  Everybody else got through the tapes in a night.  It wasn't supposed to take long, which brings us to the larger point, which is that Hannah didn't think that anybody truly cared about her.  She didn't think that she would be hurting Clay by letting him know all the reasons why.  She was incredibly depressed, she wanted Clay to know because she truly cared about Clay.  Depression does those sorts of things to people, they don't think rationally all of the time.

Lastly, you can inform people of things without saying it's their fault.  That's what she tries to do, yet despite that Clay still feels upset and like it's his fault that Hannah is dead.  That's the point though.  Hannah did not accomplish what she wanted, and an innocent person is left feeling guilty for the death of a person that he truly cared about.    

The whole, ""We all failed her"" thing is representative of society always looking the other way when people are depressed and then acting surprised when people kill themselves.

I mostly agree with your post but this bit is profoundly out of keeping with what I see, read, and experience. I mean, simply going to a Tim Horton's or any fast-food restaurant will dispel any notion that minimum wage isn't anything but a protective veil supporting workers. 

Its philosophical origin was intended to provide teenagers and newcomers to the economy a starting point but it has since then morphed into a catch-all for any unable to move up the economic ladder. 

Automation is coming and it is here. We can expect labour to lose political power. But, the end result of an impoverished nation unable to find enough value for their time and energy leads to a feudalistic nation with extreme civil unrest.

7514,"Not a fair comparison in my opinion as Rugby 7s is not the pinnacle of rugby, especially not the USA 7s team. It's like saying a rugby player who makes the Arena Football league is a successful NFL player.


Nate Ebner is obviously a great athlete, but stating that he is an 'Olympic Rugby Player' when he is playing rugby 7s for the USA is clearly trying to prove your point. If he was playing 15s in the New Zealand or UK comps it might be a decent analogy, but I think he would have about as much success as Hayne did in the NFL, if not less.


There is a clear hierarchy in the world for American Football players. The best players in the world play in the NFL, if they can't succeed there they might play CFL or somewhere else (generally of course, some might choose CFL or arena for other reasons). 


Rugby has many types of variants of the game. Rugby Union 15s, Rugby League, Rugby Union Sevens, you could name more but those are the three most competitive (arguably in order from most to least). 


Rugby union has professional competitions in several countries (with Super Rugby and Aviva Premiership being the two most competitive). Same but less so with Rugby league (NRL and Super League). Rugby sevens 'professional' pinnacle is the international circuit, these are the teams which generally play at the Olympics. Rugby sevens is generally not what a 'rugby player' aims for from the outset and to Rugby supporters generally, 7s is a 'side event' to the professional 15 a side leagues and world cups (although the inclusion in the Olympics will change that over the next few Olympic cycles).


Worldwide the player pool for the three main rugby variants is somewhat diluted, whereas Football players are herded towards the NFL. ",nfl

I'm saying that fighting alongside my family is what I would do, and most definitely what I would expect my child to do. I'm not talking about going out and looking for a fight... I mean when they're shooting at us and trying to break down the door.  This was at the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan - they didn't go looking for a fight, the Americans brought it to them. Very likely that was his first encounter with an enemy. 

He was connected to the people who pulled off 9-11, that's all. He wasn't old enough to have been given a choice, and he had been living and training with these people for 1/4 of his life. They had build orphanages and hospitals with his dad. I would completely expect my child to honour my decisions and follow my ideals. Every society praises that - we (including me) just don't agree with the ideals of the Islamists. 

&gt;Dont accuse me of Mccarthyism, you have a right to make your claim, but dont be suprised when people think you are generally trash.

Seriously? You're dismissing me as trash over this one reddit comment? I wouldn't accuse you of McCarthyism, I'd just call you as much of an idiot as the OP.  You have no evidence I'm trash, I just called some guy spouting statistics out on his bullshit and gave salient points. You haven't provided any points countering mine, so I'd say you're just acting the troll.

&gt;The people you are defending hate you, and they are not merely products of their enviroment, 

Even if the people I'm defending hate me (and I don't believe for a second they do), I understand at least that the only way to beat that is love and compassion. Hatred and violence only breeds more hatred, and we in the West are the beneficiaries of half a millennium of exploitation of the rest of the world.  We will need to make that right; the developed West continues to exploit the poor for the benefit of a very rich few. We have been sheep, and we need to wake up. 

&gt;and there are many syrians trying to fight against this kind of extremism so they can set up civil society.

7731,"In OW (and more broadly in gaming) there are two main ways to handle shooting mechanically; you can have the shooter spawn a physical object when they shoot, which follows a defined path with a certain speed/trajectory/physics behavior; or you can use a technique where you essentially define a cone where the player is looking, and when they fire, the game picks a point in that cone and ""scans"" for what it hits (a player, a wall, nothing, et cetera) without actually spawning any physical object.

In practice, what this means is that heroes that use projectiles have to factor in travel time when they aim and lead their targets, where hitscan heroes can just point at the target and fire and be sure to hit. That makes them a little easier to to be effective with, and better at taking down heroes that move unpredictably, since they don't have to predict to hit.

7804,"&gt;For example, with the holographic equation (eqn 24) - if we plug in the CODATA rest mass of the proton we yield a radius, that radius was confirmed within one sigma of our measured value at the latest accelerator experiments.

So what I'm seeing here is that he multiplies the surface area of the sphere, and multiplies it by the planck mass. Which seems strange, because mass is generally connected to volume, not area. I assume this part of his whole holographic idea, but he doesn't justify why this is done. 

Then he just straight out divides the PSUs out of the protons area, despite these PSUs supposedly being spheres. That's odd, because if you'd try to combine those spheres, then because of gaps between the spheres, you won't ever get the exact same volume as the proton. Unless these areas are weirdly shaped, but their volume is based on a sphere.. soo.. that's strange. I don't see a justification for this either. 

Then he divides the surface mass over the area? Why?  And he adds a random factor 2, which I don't see any justification for either.  

In the end he gets a number that is sort of close to the measured value, but it isn't within experimental bounds, and the method and lack of justification for any of this still makes me think he's just cherry picking random variables again. Like, why a proton? There's tons of other particles, why not work with them? By just selecting whatever particle you want, picking some variables that sound like they might be kind of related but aren't really, and by then introducing random factors (that 2), you could make basically any number you want. 

It doesn't really feel like it's the logical/causal model you claim it to be, unless there's a huge chunk of explanation that I'm missing (and which would've been great to have in the paper)

I'm not really seeing the dark energy fix in the pdf you linked either, would you mind elaborating? It seems that at the end he just divides the mass of the universe by its size, which yeah is kind of the way you get the density of the universe. Technically he uses his proton based mass thing, but that still feels like it's a rather arbitrarily picked value. In the end he gets a density that is way below what is necessary (the lower bound is seemingly at least 5 *10^-30, with most indicating something closer to 10^-29), that difference is the entire point of requiring dark energy.",conspiracy

The verses you bring up are not commandments Muslims are given that they must carry out, they are in fact re-tellings of historical events (at least that's how they can be viewed in a modern context).

Basically think of it this way, some parts of the Quran were unveiled to directly guide the Muslims during the days of the Prophet. So for example 9:29 as you bring up happened during a tense treaty between the Muslims and non-Muslims and in fact there was on going fighting and such. These verses were basically commands to the people it was revealed to at the time.

I do agree with you that the Muslims who advocate violence use these verses to justify the violence. However they very much deliberately go against the actual meanings of the verses. It's like opening up a novel, reading one line from one page and deciding what the entire story is about based on that one line.

These verses can only really be invoked in proper context, and last time I checked norway was not executing, torturing or in any real way oppressing Muslims which given the context in which tehse verses are writte makes them irrelevant.

It's a bit hard to explain in depth (and I'm probably not qualified to do so either), but there's some great reading material you can check out to actaully understand where I'm coming from. [Try here](http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/quran_929_commentary/) for just one example :)

So to summarize, you are right, they take the verses very literally but they also ignore the contexts in which they are made entirely, going so far as to take one verse out of a story and claiming it's a commandment upon all Muslims.",worldnews

A Hermes cover is an export credit guarantee by theGerman Federal Government.

Today, Hermes guarantees enable exporters to coverthemselves against economic risks and political risks.

The federal guarantee is necessary because it is notpossible to obtain adequate cover from private insurers, particularly against political risks for exports to non-OECDcountries.

The purpose of Hermes cover, from the point of view ofthe German state, is the promotion of exports and helpingto provide German jobs.

A study commissioned by the German Ministry ofEconomics and Technologies carried out by Prognosconcluded that the net effect of Hermes guarantees onemployment is in the order of 140,000 to 210,000 jobs, mainly in the mechanical engineering, electricalengineering, and chemical sectors, most Hermesguarantees being for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Hermes cover can be granted when the exporttransactions are worthy of support and the risks appeartolerable.

In recent years, state Export Credit Agencies, includingHermes have been increasingly subject to public scrutiny, because they backed projects that some disapproved of, for instance because of environmental concerns

&gt; Fenix TX (styled as Fenix*TX) is an American pop punk band. The band originally formed as Riverfenix in 1995 in Houston, Texas. They released an EP, G.B.O.H., and an album, Riverfenix, on independent record labels, before having to change their name due to a cease and desist order from the estate of actor River Phoenix. Following the change of name, they signed with major label MCA Records in 1999. On MCA, they released two further albums, 1999's Fenix TX and 2001's Lechuza, which collectively sold over 600,000 units, prior to breaking up in 2002 over creative differences.[1]

&gt; After the split, bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Damon DeLaPaz devoted themselves to their now defunct side project Sing the Body Electric, while vocalist/guitarist Will Salazar and guitarist Chris Lewis formed the band Denver Harbor.

&gt; In September 2005, Fenix TX announced their reunion. They released a live album, Purple Reign in Blood, and supported it with tours across the United States and Japan. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; AlunaGeorge are an English electronic music duo from London, consisting of Aluna Francis (vocals and songwriting) and George Reid (production and instrumentation).The duo first met in June 2009, when Reid remixed Francis' band My Toys Like Me's track ""Sweetheart""

&gt; A lot of bands meet as kids at school. Others come together after an over-enthusiastic conversation about music at some random party. Aluna Francis and George Reid however, met through the internet.

&gt; While their online encounter is more MySpace than Match.com, it was in fact through a mutual respect for each other's work that led them to go on to form AlunaGeorge. Now together for just barely a year, the talented duo have been churning out a series of infectious mixes which fuse Francis' sweet vocal harmonies with the hushed electronic stylings courtesy of Reid.

&gt; Having already caught the attention of Rob da Bank who championed their initial collaboration Sweetheart on Radio 1; they've since succeeded in initially tapping the American market having had a track featured in the US series of Skins earlier this year. Now this month sees the release of their debut AA single Analyser/ We Are Chosen, two impressively mastered melodies of sensual synths complemented by Francis' contagious vocals which evoke notions of the likes of Shanks and Bigfoot, yet at the same time remain utterly unique.

One of the most damning pieces about the US political system was the 2016 democracy index study by The Economist, in which the US barely missed the category ""full democracy"", placing second highest in category ""flawed democracy"". There were far poorer, and less developed countries that were determined to have a stronger democracy than the US, Mauritius in Africa and Uruguay in South America being the most obvious examples here.

The civil and criminal cases are not sharing resources.

Normally the people.filing the civil case have to spend tons of money up front deposing witnesses, subpoenaing docs, etc.

Then once you have all the evidence, you forward to law enforcement for a criminal case.

It's more uncommon for a crook to be so brazen and incompetent that the criminal case can start before the civil case.

He runs away with her to Essos and Lys. She stays with him for a time until one day he's off in another land fighting as a sellsword to make some money to bring home. While he's gone she starts sleeping with a Prince of Lys who has multiple concubines and she becomes his ""chief"" concubine. She starts living in his mance.

When Jorah returns she and the Prince tell him that they are no longer together. The prince threatens to kill Jorah if he doesn't leave Lys immediately, which he does.

Now maybe Lynesse was somehow manipulated or threatened into the marriage but she becomes the Prince's ""chief"" concubine, which implies she was probably willing and if she willingly left Jorah for someone rich and powerful and Jorah spent his riches on her then it seems likely that she was in fact a frigid gold digging bitch.",gameofthrones

Fact is LGBT relationships run the full gamut of relationships from totally monogamous to polyamorous, pure vanilla to 24/7 ownership and everything in-between.  Same same-sex relationships will look like a stereotypical straight relationship, but many don't, just as many straight relationships don't look like the stereotypical straight relationship.  Same-sex couples face the same problems straight couples do, just the configuration of genitals is different.

It's just like with feminism, it's not that women should feel like they have to buck traditional gender normatives, but they should have the option to do what makes them happy.  If Suzy wants to be a home-maker, more power to her.  If Jessica wants to be the next president, you go girl.  The same applies to same-sex relationships.

The problem for a defense is they don't know how much time they have before the snap. 3 seconds or 20?

People are talking about the Colts had few formations, which is key for 100% no huddle.  That simplicity that allows no huddle also forces simplicity on defense. 

Teams usually run players in and out on situations. Against the no huddle those defensive decisions on substitutions have to be made and happen before the QB gets to the line.

After the QB gets to the line he may take another 20 seconds figuring out the defense, calling audibles and moving guys. But you as a defensive coach still can not try to substitute or the ball will be immediately snapped.

Pressurized containers/pressure vessels. 

I'm not sure where I developed this fear, but since I was a kid it was something that kind of freaked me out. I'd always feared that something could explode and send shrapnel or a valve into my face and possibly break something or go straight into my brain. 

I did some research online and found very few stuff about [genetic memories] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10486479/Phobias-may-be-memories-passed-down-in-genes-from-ancestors.html) which at the time was basically mocked and called a pseudoscience. 

I then also found out that I'd gotten the fear from my dad, who when he was young, was moving some pressurized containers, and another soldier was using them for some reason when somehow one burst in front of my dad and sent a valve flying into the guys face, breaking several bones, and my dad rushed to help with about 3 other guys, the dude was choking on his own blood and it was a very bad situation. Dad never told me what else happened to the guy or if he lived or not, just know that's where I might've gotten that fear from. My dad would be extremely cautious and weary around them, and kind of go around a corner to do other work when people would start fiddling with them. 

I still have this habit...when my dad turns on the propane tank on the grill to start grilling some meat I get really paranoid and go to check up on other stuff inside or what not. I fucking hate being close to them for some odd reason. I can still do work with them, it doesn't stop me, but if I can avoid it, I avoid it. 

It's probably irrational, but you know, I'm paranoid around them. 

edit: Seeing [these] (http://cen.acs.org/content/dam/cen/94/17/06-9417notw2.jpg) makes me feel kind of uneasy in real life for some reason. Always picture them exploding, or leaking and sending some valve into my face or through my skull. ",AskReddit

I'm deliberately trying not to put any words in your mouth. I'm parsing your argument as explicitly as I can. Also, I don't care how you feel. It is irrelevant to the discussion!

&gt;I never said it was direct proof. It's abductive reasoning. We do it all the time. It's not proof but that doesn't make it invalid.

This is the kind of logical train of thought that leads to thinking the Earth is flat! At a certain point, you need to recognize that your personal validation is not more valuable than the validation of **practically the entire globe**. Science is not existentialism.

&gt;What is your observable direct proof of why the universe exists, how it continues to exist and why it's capable of supporting life? Oh right, you don't have any.

I never claimed that I did! I said that we've observed the Earth rotating around the Sun &amp; that we've observed nothing about God. Ergo, science is less faith-based than religion. The fact that I don't have a mathematical breakdown of the creation of the universe doesn't make science a religion. That's a straight up appeal to extremes fallacy!

&gt; Indio is :

&gt; 1. ...the name of a side project of Detroit techno artist John Beltran. A self-titled album was released by the Transmat label of Derrick May in 1999, followed by two EPs. 

&gt; 2. the stage name used by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Peterson.  He originally formed a band in his early musical career, but split up the band because he felt as if he had to restrict his music and make it conform to the limits and abilities of those specific band members.  He would rather choose his own set of band members for each individual track.

&gt; His only album, an eponymous released in 1989, yielded little success.  The most well known and well appreciated track is almost inarguably ""Hard Sun"", which was covered by grunge idol Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Temple of the Dog, in a brief solo project for the Sean Penn movie Into the Wild.

&gt; Indio's style of music is generally very rhythmic and often uses heavy sets of layered percussion.  He is also appreciated amongst his limited fan base as a staggeringly visual and talented lyricist.

&gt; 3. Argentinian folk duo.

* They left Johnson out for far too long after it was clear that he was imploding (this one is more of a minor quibble)

* After a leadoff walk to Inciarte in the top of the 10th, they call for Brandon Phillips (.282/.328/.418) to sacrifice bunt, simultaneously throwing away their first out and all but guaranteeing that Freddie Freeman gets walked. Matt Kemp proceeded to ground into a double play. Big surprise.

* Sam Freeman faced one batter in the bottom of the 9th to send the game to extras. He's been one of the Braves best relievers this season (2.54 ERA, 3.19 FIP and a .32 HR/9). Terry/Snitker from the clubhouse or whomever decide to hook him in favor of Ian Krol  (4.70 ERA, 4.92 FIP, 1.47 HR/9) who promptly gave up the walkoff hit.

8493,"&gt; I wouldn't be so quick to blame people for initially voting for the AKP.

They (this is common) are blaming a specific set of people though, not 'the people' at large.  Besides initially AKP only got 33% but an overwhelming majority in the parliament.

&gt; The nationalistic Kemalist 'social democracy' of the CHP and the Turkish establishment was a very authoritarian and overbearing regime for many pious Turks.

CHP wasn't even in the parliament in 2002 -- they were below the threshold.    The so-called po-mo coup of '97 did hurt a lot of pious people but I doubt it was enough to sway elections.  The reasons to support AKP in the first term would be things like completing the privatizations (the big one, the national telco hadn't been privatized yet), continuing with the EU harmonization packages, fiscal discipline etc.  We had an unpopular program implemented after the economic crisis of 2001 and AKP was uniquely positioned to implement it because it would pacify the people who'd have screamed otherwise and they had to do it because that was the only avenue open to them (the establishment would have taken them down otherwise, as they tried in various ways).   This was the calculation: they'd finish destroying the power of entrenched interests with the economic transformation plans; subdue the pious masses who could, if in opposition, be mobilized against the new policies; continue on the set path to securing Turkish candidacy for accession to EU while pulling their loud anti-West base to positions compatible with it etc.  The flaw in the intellectuals' support was not about supporting AKP, the flaw was telling people that they were either 'liberals' or were 'liberalizing' out of their own ideological bent.  That latter bit discredited both those intellectuals and more or less finished off the label 'liberal.'  

&gt;  In this case, if Kemalism didn't have so many shortcomings, the program of the AKP - which initially seemed very progressive, like overhauling the healthcare system and making it modern and universal - would not have appealed to large swaths of the Turkish population.

I don't even know what Kemalism is or was as of 2002.  The social security reform did happen alongside many others, yes.  I used to joke that, with some modifications, what they did would have had some other party pegged as 'red' _by their own base_ just a decade or so ago.  I posted a short summary about the 'left'-ish thing they did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Turkey/comments/1dhq1o/akp_government_and_the_future_of_chp_voters_in/c9qjmgq/).

Why can´t his sister survive on her own if she grew up in hell I wonder - probably just a psychological thing...

I hoped that he would run his horse off the cliff and I love him for the fact that he did. *(sad about the horse though)*

Mugen is kinda cold towards his sister, she is a bit weird too, though. I can´t even imagine to grow up with nothing but criminals around me.

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

Subsequently, those companies made a lot of money of those shares for which they did not pay taxes in Russia or the States.  In early 2008 HSBC and Hermatige were accused of committing fraud against the Russian treasury.  This was before Magnitsky events.   Browder's office was raided because of these investigations... concerning the fraud that occurred against the Russian treasury. 

Magnitsky was not a lawyer.  Magnitsky was an accountant. He did not turn any documents concerning corruption, he was investigated after being named as a co-conspirator by one of the people that were found guilty of defrauding the Russian treasury.  That is why the offices got raided, and that is why Magnitsky was interrogated twice. 

There is a great documentary that Browder is having censored in the West that goes over the official story, and looks at the actual evidence and interviews the people involved.  It makes a good case that it was actually Browder working with HSBC that committed fraud.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/6d0e411450db456d8a1c2e333ea336f8.png)  

&gt; K's Choice is a Belgian rock band from Antwerp. The band centers on siblings Sarah Bettens (lead vocals, guitar) and Gert Bettens (guitar, keyboard, vocals). They are joined by Eric Grossman (bass), Jan van Sichem Jr. (guitar) and Koen Liekens (drums).

&gt; Their music can be described as guitar-based singer-songwriter rock or folk-rock. It ranges from very delicate and intimate singer-songwriter songs to songs that are stronger, more active and louder. Sarah's smoky, enigmatic voice is the band's best known characteristic. In the seven years between The Great Subconscious Club and Almost Happy the music changed from raw and guitar-based to a more subtle and delicate sound. Sarah and Gert write most of the music and lyrics. Most of it is written separately. 

&gt; Sarah mainly tries to express ideas in her songs, and has a hand in writing silly and tongue-in-cheek songs. Gert has one big theme: losing the one you love. While most of the songs are easily accessible and open, some others are strange and incomprehensible. This led Sarah to comment: ""Listening to the lyrics in the first time, you may find it hard to understand their meaning. When you listen to them a second time you may sense a basic truth in these cryptic words. If you do so, please let me know.""

&gt; This band appeared in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Doppelgangland) with the song Virgin State of Mind, leading to a boost in popularity.Their most popular song 'Not an addict' can be heard in the movie 'Wild things'.

&gt; K's Choice has a new album, Echo Mountain, with a March 26, 2010 release date. Read more on Last.fm.

Did they figure they'd kill two birds with one stone and let Reyes die too? Did Reyes have a change of heart and try to save Morrison? He seems filles with hatred too much for that to be the case.

That Explosion... I don't trust that information. I mean, it comes from a blog like, ingame blog post from a seemingly pretty biased source. 
And like ""Their fighting caused an Explosion."" 
That doesn't make sense. Did they accidentally turn on the gas stove? Did one of them punch the water boiler?

This is the most important moment, maybe, in both their lives. It turned Gabriel into Reaper and Jack into Soldier 76 and we know virtually *nothing* about it. 
Did Gabe already have that ability to turn himself into nanite smoke? If not: How did he get it? Who gave it to him? Talon? But then, how can Reaper have been sighted for decades when the explosion happened about 5 years ago?
What made him so bitter about Overwatch? Was he maybe brainwashed like Widowmaker?

And why is Jack so jaded? Why would he looking for the people responsible for the fall of Overwatch if he *knew* that it was Gabriel?

Did Gabe let Jesse go or even tell him to get out? How the hell did Jesse McCree rack up a 6 Mill bounty? What about Genji?

What role did Mercy play? THere is a voiceline ingame that insinuates she should know what happened to Reaper?

And so on. 

But the most important is the explosion and the question did he or did he not?

Because if Reaper did not, then who did and why was Gabriel caught in it?
Maybe he DID go back and tried to save Jack and heck, maybe even succeeded. He sure as hell didn't seem surprised to see him in Egypt. So what if he saved Jack and Jack as usual got the preferential treatment, got saved and taken care of (who saved Jack?) and Gabriel got left behind to die.

It's more to do with the survival of a society, rather than survival of the individual, and it comes down to the social contract and the monopoly on violence. 

Terrorism doesn't have as a goal to ""kill a bunch of people"" it's goal is to destroy the monopoly of violence a state has. The monopoly of violence is the single most fundamental part of the social contract, in which the state is given the ability to enforce rules through violence, while the citizens can't. In exchange the citizens get security. It is fundamental, since without it, no government is better than a mafia or charity, and with it, any organization is a state. 

When people drive drunk, they aren't (in the mind of the citizen) contesting this monopoly on violence, since it's disorganized and purely random. When a gang puts people on the border of the neighborhoods it controls, and enforces its rules inside those neighborhoods, they become the state in there. That's what mafias do, when they ask for protection money. With enough terror attacks, people WILL stop seeing their state as having the monopoly of violence, and will start trying to protect themselves using violence. This is how gangs, mafias and revolutions happen, and it's the way societies get killed. This is the actual goal of terrorism, eliminating the social contract in your enemies societies, making the conditions ripe for you to swoop in, and provide security in exchange of enforcing your own rules.

8854,"i certainly wouldn't mind such a deal with the publisher, but regardless of the unlikelihood of that, how is it in any way better to have nothing enjoyable rather than something enjoyable *but not as much as you thought there would be*?

it sort of depends on your definition of ""novel."" if you're considering the potentially 7-book-long cycle as one unit, then of course it seems unfinished until the last one is complete. but if you view them as individual novels with their own arcs, then the fact that a sequel has been promised is just that... a fact, something to look forward to and perhaps rue if it somehow doesn't come to pass, but why should that change anything about the present? 

The new national obsession with completionism and instant gratification is unhealthy and kind of strange. writing and publishing a novel is a job, and completing that is worth some money if people are willing to pay it. there can be subjective assessments of how well that novel stands on its own, but acting like the promise of future installments makes anything less than 100% of the promise meaningless is silly.

Basically, if you enjoyed the first book, or the first five books, then nobody but you can take that enjoyment away.  and reading the book in the first place was certainly your choice, presumably done with the full knowledge that it was part of a proposed cycle. if you consider that to be ""taking a risk,"" then it's entirely your responsibility.

8931,"""Back when I was in the sixth grade, my whole family went out to go watch a baseball game at the stadium. I didn't really care about baseball, but I was surprised by what I saw when we got there. Everywhere I looked, I saw people. On the other side of the stadium, the people looked so small, like little moving grains of rice. It was so crowded. I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him, ""Do you know how many people are here right now""? He said since the stadium was full, probably fifty thousand. After the game, the street was filled with people and I was really shocked to see that, too. To me, it seemed like there was a ton of people there. But then, I realized it could only be a tiny fraction of all the people in Japan. When I got home, I pulled out my calculator. In social studies, I'd learned that the population of Japan was a hundred some odd million. So I divided that by fifty thousand. The answer was one two-thousandth. That shocked me even more. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and believe me, there were so many people there, but it was just a handful of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all. When I realized that, it suddenly felt like the whole world around me started to fade into a dull gray void. Brushing my teeth and going to sleep at night, waking up and eating breakfast in the morning, that stuff happened all over the place. They were everyday things that everybody was doing. When I thought about it like that, everything became boring. If there's really that many people in the world, then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary. There had to be someone who was living an interesting life. There just had to be. But why wasn't I that person? So, that's how I felt till I finished elementary school. And then I had another realization. I realized fun things wouldn't come my way just by waiting for them. I thought when I got into junior high, it was time for me to make a change. I'd let the world know I wasn't a girl who was happy sitting around waiting. And I've done my best to become that person. But in the end, nothing happened. More time went by and before I knew it, I was in high school. I thought that something would change."" - Haruhi Suzumiya",anime

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;We are constantly improving the matchmaker. We learn more each day. We have one of our best engineers and best designers full time dedicated to the system. Many of those “silent” patches that go out during the week are adjustments to the system. For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy – they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match. The worst part was, by the time he finally got a match, he had been waiting so long that the system had “opened up” to lower skill players. Now one of the best Widowmaker players was facing off against players at a lower skill level. As a result, we’ve disabled the Avoid system (the UI will go away in an upcoming patch). The system was designed with the best intent. But the results were pretty disastrous.

&gt;Great post, ExcaliburZ. Allow me to share some of my personal thoughts on matchmaking...

&gt;

&gt;We’ve been following all of the discussion around matchmaking. When topics get discussed in the community (and often among game developers) we tend to talk about things in very black/white or right/wrong terms. But most important decisions you make as a game developer are difficult trade-off decisions with no perfect answer.

&gt;

&gt;The goal of the matchmaking is to make it so that you as a player do not have to find 11 other people to play with. You can click a Play button, and the system finds other players for you. That’s the basics. The reality is, the matchmaker is extremely complex in what it is trying to do. It does way more than I am going to mention in this post so while I am going to offer some information here, I am leaving some things out (not all intentionally – it’s just a really complex system).

&gt;

&gt;At a most basic level, the matchmaker is trying to put you with 11 other people. But it doesn’t just randomly select 11 people. It takes into account a number of factors (more than I am going to list and not necessarily prioritized).

&gt;

&gt;The first factor is time. The matchmaker will try to find you match quickly and not force you to wait too long. A very common thing that happens is that a player will become dissatisfied with a match and say “I don’t care how long you make me wait. I’d rather wait 20 minutes and have a good match than get matchmade into a match like you just put me into.” What we’ve seen is that when the time crosses a certain threshold, players begin to complain about it taking too long to find a match. It sounds good… waiting for that perfect match. But when the reality of waiting too long comes down on most people, they end up vocalizing their discontent on the forums. Also, there is an unrealistic expectation that if a player waits longer for a match, the “better” the match will be. The concept of “better” when it comes to matchmaking is a really hard one to define.

&gt;

&gt;If I were to summarize match results into 5 broad buckets it would be these:

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;1.       My team won. We beat the other team by a long shot.

&gt;

&gt;2.       My team barely won.

&gt;

&gt;3.       My team barely lost.

&gt;

&gt;4.       My team lost. We lost by a long shot. It wasn’t even close

&gt;

&gt;5.       It was a broken match somehow. Maybe someone disconnected, was screwing around or we played with fewer than 12 people.

&gt;

&gt;(of course there are more cases than this – I am overly simplifying here)

&gt;

&gt;Most players will say that they want a match to be either type 2 or type 3 as I described above. Those sound even. Barely win or barely lose. But I believe when psychology comes into play, most players actually expect type 1 or type 2 to be the result. Even an amazingly close type 3 match can turn into a highly negative experience for a lot of players. And if you keep “barely losing” it’s not a very fun night. Winning is fun and good. Losing is less fun than winning.

&gt;

&gt;So waiting a really long time to lose by a long shot is obviously not good. But waiting a really long time to barely lose is also a negative experience. And if we assume that your chances of winning are 50%, that means that even waiting a really long time for a “better” match means that you’re going to wait a really long time to probably lose half the time… If your expectation was that you were going to wait a really long time for an awesome match where you either 1) Won by a long shot or 2) Barely won… but still won nonetheless, your expectations for what the system can or should do are in the wrong place. We do not generate bots to take losses so you can win more than 50% of the time. Those are real people losing on the other end of every loss you take.

&gt;

&gt;A second factor we take into account is ping. We’re matchmaking people all over the world and we want to match people to the closest servers for the best play experience. In our second stress test, we had other things prioritized over ping-based matchmaking such as skill and time. For those of you who participated in that stress test, you’ll remember how terrible the game performance was on the first day as well as how “lit up” the forums were demanding that players be given an option of server choice. So now we prioritize ping for players. Some players live in challenging parts of the world when it comes to high speed data connections (I’m looking at you, Andes mountain range…) so it’s not perfect for everyone. But largely, most people get a really decent connection to our game servers. Matching players with wildly disparate pings also results in a higher frequency of undesirable side effects such as “getting shot behind walls”. Of course if you live in Houston, Texas and group with your buddy in Geneva, Switzerland, you’re now introducing uncertainty to our system that’s harder for us to deal with… but we allow it.

&gt;

&gt;Which brings us to the next factor that we match on: grouping. The majority of our matches are comprised of either all solo players or solo players and players grouped with one other person. However, the system does try to match groups of equal sizes together first and foremost. As the time people wait grows, we expand the search to try to find others for them to play with. This means that occasionally we will match groups with players who are not grouped or in a group size that is smaller than their own. Like I mentioned, this is exceedingly rare but can happen. And that match is only made when players have crossed a waiting threshold that we deem too long. For most group matches a group of 6 is placed against another group of 6.

&gt;

&gt;Groups are a big challenge in our matchmaking system. You can group with people of wildly varying skill and ping and we allow you to. It’s pretty unlikely that there is another group in the queue that exactly mirrors the unique circumstances that you have set up (pings, skills etc.).  We want you to group. We feel that it’s the best way to play the game. So we try to avoid things that discourage grouping and we want to continually improve the social systems so that you’ll find it easier and easier to group with people you have chosen to play with. Playing with people you choose to play with is going to be more reliably fun than playing with people we choose for you. I once used the analogy of hanging out with people on a Saturday night. If you were to go out with five of your friends it would probably be a better time than if we tried to find 5 random people for you to go out with, no matter how smart we were in our selection process…

&gt;

&gt;Anyway, this leads me to matchmaking rating. This rating is the most important thing that we try to match on. Basically this rating means “how good are you?” Commonly, you’ll hear this referred to as Matchmaking Rating or MMR. MMR is derived differently in different games. Overwatch borrows a lot of knowledge from other games but also does a lot of things unique to Overwatch. As each player plays games, their matchmaking rating goes up or down depending on if they win or lose. The system is extremely complicated and there is a lot more going on here than I am going to spell out. So please don’t take this as the comprehensive guide to how MMR is calculated in Overwatch. There is definitely a lot more going on under the hood.

9084,"This is a US-based analysis.
It fits Canada as much as the weather forecast of Florida does Newfoundland.

This is one of my favorites, often cited here in /r/Canada in some way:

&gt; When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small. To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school—who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.
&gt;Evidence on the inflow of high-skilled immigrants suggests that there may be positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers, and other, wider benefits to the economy more broadly.

How does this one happen then: [Average hourly wages in Canada have barely budged in 40 years](http://globalnews.ca/news/3531614/average-hourly-wage-canada-stagnant/)

[Or here in pictures](http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/canadas-50-most-important-economic-charts-for-2016/#chart-4)

All his other points are US specific, thereby it's irrelevant for this discussion.

According to Milton Friedman though:

&gt;Because it is one thing to have free immigration to jobs. It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare. And you cannot have both. If you have a welfare state, if you have a state in which every resident is promised a certain minimal level of income, or a minimum level of subsistence, regardless of whether he works or not, produces it or not.

And before you say ""See the Final match was more popular last time..."" This major was a huge upset, the two teams in the final were not fan favorites, they weren't big name teams and a lot of people were salty with the upsets (lost them the chance at the golden pick'em challenge trophy), so people didn't care as much.

&gt; With the end of Game of Thrones in sight, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have set their sights on their next TV project.
&gt; 
&gt; The award-winning duo will reteam with HBO for the drama series Confederate, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
&gt; 
&gt; The drama chronicles the events leading to the Third American Civil War. The series takes place in an alternate timeline, where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution. The story follows a broad swath of characters on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Demilitarized Zone — freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executives of a slave-holding conglomerate and the families of people in their thrall.
&gt; 
&gt; Benioff and Weiss will write the project and serve as showrunners. Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified, The Good Wife) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire) are also attached as writers. The four will executive produce with Carolyn Strauss (Game of Thrones) and Bernadette Caulfield (Game of Thrones, Big Love). Production on Confederate will begin after the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones, which is expected to air in either 2018 or 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; ""As the brilliant Game of Thrones winds down to its final season, we are thrilled to be able to continue our relationship with Dan and David, knowing that any subject they take on will result in a unique and ambitious series,"" HBO president of original programming Casey Bloys said Wednesday in a statement. ""Their intelligent, wry and visually stunning approach to storytelling has a way of engaging an audience and taking them on an unforgettable journey. Confederate promises to be no exception, and we are honored to be adding the talented team of Nichelle and Malcolm Spellman to the mix.""
&gt; 
&gt; Confederate joins original dramas Westworld, which just nabbed 22 Emmy nominations, as well as the forthcoming David Simon period drama The Deuce, which is set to premiere in September. While the pay cabler has expanded its comedy offerings with recent entries like Insecure and Divorce, its drama offerings have dwindled in recent years with the recent third and final season of The Leftovers and the upcoming end of Game of Thrones, by far the channel's most-watched series ever.
&gt; 
&gt; HBO's other upcoming series include Succession from Adam McKay (The Big Short), Today Will Be Different starring Julia Roberts, the Amy Adams-led Sharp Objects and family drama Here, Now from former True Blood and Six Feet Under boss Alan Ball. As with Ball and The Wire's Simon, HBO has worked repeatedly with several of its most acclaimed creators, making a second collaboration with Benioff and Weiss all the more logical.
&gt; 
&gt; In anticipation of Game of Thrones' upcoming final season — the seven-episode seventh season launched on Sunday — HBO is already hard at work on four (potentially five) possible successor shows, with different writers attached to each project. Benioff and Weiss, however, will not have a role in any future Game of Thrones projects, opting instead to focus on ending the original series and now, seemingly, Confederate.
&gt; 
&gt; For Benioff and Weiss, Confederate would mark only their second TV series, the first being Game of Thrones. The Troy scribe and Lucky Wander Boy author, respectively, found enormous success with the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's beloved book series. They have each won four Emmys, including two for best drama series for Game of Thrones.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We have discussed Confederate for years, originally as a concept for a feature film,"" said Benioff and Weiss. ""But our experience on Thrones has convinced us that no one provides a bigger, better storytelling canvas than HBO. There won't be dragons or White Walkers in this series, but we are creating a world, and we couldn't imagine better partners in world-building than Nichelle and Malcolm, who have impressed us for a long time with their wit, their imagination and their Scrabble-playing skills.""

9254,"I get where you're coming from- talking about how in a hero shooter, a character should be expectes to adhere to their assigned class. Tanks should be hardy and be less inclined to put out meningful DPS. 

However, Overwatch is also a game where some DPS's can heal/help heal and where some support heroes can pull off major plays that have nothing to do with how well they heal. 

What I'm trying to say is that Roadhog's *was* a bit much before the rework. But it wasn't because the combo could 1 shot. Disregarding the ways you could bait or block the hook, it was the fact that 1 shot was almost always garenteed with little hope of countering the second you got hooked. Sometimes, maybe the Hog player might shoot a bit off, leaving you with little health, and you got a chance to retaliate. But the Hog would normally have enough health to plow through the rest of your health. 

As he stands now, Roadhog is too much of a liability to be on a competitive team due to the way he feeds enemy ult. And making him ""more of a tank"" would only just rekt his play style and theme and might actually make him worse if the enemy is able to farm him even more for that tankiness. 

My idea for a new passive would hopefully discourage enemies to damage roadhog similar to Zarya's barriers in fear of just making the Roadhog strong enough for him to 1 shot combo. At the same time, that strength would have a weakness in that it would only be available when hog is relatively low on  health, so if the hog can't make picks soon, he'll probably die.

And who knows? My idea might not be the best. But, I'd like to think that it could possibly give someone another idea of their own so that this community can help smooth out this games edges.",Overwatch

I meant, that I am willing to sacrifice my own desire to take care of things my own, if that meant that others would survive. I listed a few examples about why I think people would die if I (and others) had guns everywhere.

&gt; The question is not who keeps us safe. But only because thats not even a question for me. It's obvious, I am responsible for myself.

But how will you protect yourself from enemy armies? You don't have the power to do everything alone.

&gt; Thats good. Thats because you probably live in a country with no gun culture. Which I think is what scares people. Hell, it even worries me. I do believe there is a difference between self protection and a total gun culture. Gun culture is very bad and it's what has turned the USA in to an un-self aware parody of freedom.
A gun should be like your wages. Everyone knows you have it but you don't talk about it. It's no ones business. It's simply a means of protection.

As I said, I am pro-gun and I am actually interested in buying one. I do however have to correct myself; My life was in danger last year, when I needed a surgery. I gave up the responsibility to protect my life and instead I let someone else, a professional, handle it. I think the same system can be applied everywhere.

We're looking at 3-4 patients per testing site (hospitals/clinics), so we contract with 44 sites at an estimated cost of $3.6 million per site over the life of the study, approximately 2 years unless we get back data that extends the study (usually a good thing for drug development). That's just the site costs for the late stage part of the trial. It doesn't include the production and packaging of the drug, drug shipment costs, the staff costs (staff to review the data, the contracting staff, the patient safety staff, etc.), the investigator meeting costs, travel costs for site visits, the early and middle stages of the trial, and so, so many other costs that are in there for data accuracy and patient safety. And honestly these costs could be much, much higher. When dealing with sites and patient reimbursements and stipends we have a legally-mandated soft ceiling for costs, the Fair Market Value for payments of the type. Without government mandates that costs can't be seen as coercive or an incentive for study participation we'd have to pay out even more. 

And there's only a return on investment if the drug actually works. If it doesn't then that's billions of R&amp;D dollars down the drain that need to be recouped via the drugs that actually do work. Don't blame the FDA mandates for the price of drugs. They're there to keep you safe. The last thing you want to do is allow drug companies to cut corners in drug safety to reduce costs. The pharma company I work for has drugs cheaper in other countries than in the US. Same drug, same testing process, same safety, etc. But the drugs are cheaper there because they are allowed to collectively negotiate prices through their government insurance plan to cover everyone in the country, not piecemeal like in the US. Additionally, the discounts other countries or certain domestic insurers get causes a bump in the prices for everyone else because the drug companies still want to get their profits from somewhere. 

Don't forget about the rules governing generics, either. They are stricter in the US than in other countries, so drug companies elsewhere drop prices to keep their original drug competitive in those markets. ",AskReddit

- Property values when the city is attacked by a giant insect.
- Disposal of all the rubble, aliens, meteors, and giant insect goo by our sanitation department and the tax burden it causes.
- An entire economy based on spandex sales.
- The psychological toll living in a city that is under attack weekly.  How can you do your grocery shopping knowing that, at any moment, your car will animate itself and attack people?
- Why hasn't anyone executed or lynched Lex Luthor?  That guy has more political comebacks than Marion Barry.

I gave one of my friends a ride to the dance and she just left to go on her phone and whatnot.

Some girls at my table asked me to dance and they were like ""you shouldn't spend your birthday like this"" so that was cool of them.

I go home and told my mom ""yeah, that dance sucked"" and she understood so that was also pretty cool. Then my sisters friend who was over said happy birthday when no one else did.

The various Scottish languages declined and English rose to prominence long before Scotland even joined with England to become the UK.

9465,"Not to rain on your parade, but you can just turn back to the IMT or C9 games... Bjerg basically has his whole team in his lane for at least half the early-mid game. He didn't get 10 solo kills on Pobelter to get that ridiculous Syndra lead. And watch how many times Bio or Sven or Hauntzer (or combinations of them) will stop by his lane, camp a brush for 10 seconds or so, then Bjerg will act like he's roaming and join them, sit for another 10 seconds or so... It adds up.

Time is a resource as much as gold or minions are. To be fair to Bjerg he is *very* good at being worth the investment. But to say he gets few resources and completely discount the large amount of time his team spends huddling in his lane brushes for him is disingenuous. 

As to Huhi's laning, maybe I just picked the wrong games but I checked a couple TSM vs CLG matches and found that Bjerg and Huhi were trading 3-5 CS leads (in other words they were pretty much dead even). The only game Bjerg got a lead was when CLG shoved a big wave into the bot lane and were preparing a dive. Huhi and Bjerg both roamed down but Bjerg cleared the whole wave before CLG could dive. Before the dive Bjerg had a 1 wave advantage, after it was a bit over 2 waves.

Against Jensen Huhi did much worse in CS, falling about 30-40 behind but that was Huhi's ASol game where he was 5-1-2. Obviously roamed a ton, as usual. 2nd game as Vlad he was also down around 30 CS. It was about 15 CS at first (which I think is just the match up) then progressed to around 30 after he got killed. 3rd game he actually has about a 1 wave lead over Jensen's Syndra.

TLDR: Huhi's not as bad at laning as you may think or stats may suggest. He used to be a lot worse from what I remember but he's improved a ton. I'm guessing his CS numbers just get hurt pretty badly by his roam-heavy performances.",leagueoflegends

9469,"[Everything] Why I like Jon's scenes more than Dany's

We don't know that Jon is not a legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna.  There are two books yet to be written, and there are plenty of theories out there that, because the Targaryens often took more than one wife, Rhaegar very likely married Lyanna - the daughter of Ned Stark who, in my own humble opinion, wouldn't bring dishonor to her family by having a child out of wedlock.  It is beyond a stretch of the imagination to believe Lyanna would consent to have sex without the benefit of marriage.  The strong reality is that Jon is NOT a bastard son of Rhaegar, but a legitimate son of his and Lyanna's and, therefore, the TRUE heir to the Iron Throne.

It's like the debate on prostitution; no, no one should be stopping women (and men) from doing what they want with their bodies, but yes, in many cases, these people are forced, trafficked, exploited, raped, facing violence, etc... in prostitution rings.

I honestly have got no real position on these questions, I find it very hard to balance an idealistic view of ""people should just have the right to do what they want"" as I realise it's also a handy way to ignore the people who are victims of such practices, but at the same time, banning clothes (even if I personally find them contemptible) does seem very illiberal. But I really don't think there are any perfect solutions anyway, outside of bolstering education, emancipation and integration (although I know there is a bit of backlash against the idea of integration-assimiliation lately).

As for Sven and the outjungling, it's largely more of a team issue than an individual one, if you look at a lot of the plays Sven was making in Spring that were working, then failed at MSI, that are working now, it largely just that Bjerg's playing better now and they have more pressure from botside. I think Sven is definitely the weakest link on the team but the overall ""outjungling"" argument comes up pretty weak when the whole team was underperforming.  

As for Hauntzer vs Huni, we've seen the matchup like 20 times from back when Huni was in the NALCS so it's clear that Huni isn't drastically better than Hauntzer. He definitely outperformed him at MSI, but history, and his performances/benching that followed indicate to me that it was more of a momentary gap than the actual difference in their skill level.",leagueoflegends

9522,"I completely disagree. 

Offense and Defense are very different roles with very different goals in mind. Offense heroes are built to get kills regardless of map or situation. Defense heroes are built to deny area. Defense heroes struggle on offense because it is harder to keep an area denied that is constantly moving. Widowmaker/Hanzo can't set up a killzone, bastion/torbjorn can't have turrets set up and waiting for the enemy. This is also the reason that professional players don't use defense heroes, why use a hero to deny an area when you can just use an offense hero and remove the enemy entirely? 

Symmetra is a support hero. She supports defenders, which is why a lot of players have a harder time pinning her down. Her turrets do very little on their own, but are much more potent when combined with a junkrat trap or mei to keep an enemy immobile. Her right-click projectile is very slow moving, but is a solid addition to the team when a Reinhardt or Orisa is blocking the sightlines of your Hanzo/Widow from getting kills.

Mobilizes for what tho? There's still half a year before elections, right? And if they're fans there is no need to pander to them, because their votes are secured, and those who are against propaganda billboards will just get put off more. There has to be something going on on a higher, geopolitical level, that we cant see. Maybe guy tried to gain some influence and they're trying to combat that, dunno.

&gt; it brings on board some antisemites

Guy is borderline sketchy with his funding, that many people agree on, is criticizing him based on that antisemitism? If a jewish guy pulls some bullcrap, and people or an organization or a government bands up to call him out on it/expose him, they're antisemites? Based on religion of that guy alone? So you cant never question or say anything bad about a jewish guy, because you're immediately an antisemite? Do ""god's chosen"" get a free pass on pushing personal agendas or something?

&gt; On the other hand, countryside people who are terrified of refugees and rich and upper middle class people who rely on Fidesz economically would never leave them over something like this, so they can put out as many billboards as they want.

Eeeeh, i dunno about that. People generally only care about having stable lives - as long as there are job opportunities, their kids get an education, they have a home and retirement is secured they couldnt care less about some refugees. As soon as the voter base sniffs that someone else might provide them with better lives they'll switch, and nothing annoys people more than propaganda or hypocrisy, so stuff like that can bite the ruling party in the ass.",europe

Ahh, it seems the change in location did well for Oscar, giving us and her an opportunity to really see the situation that’s brewing under the surface. Things are quickly starting to heat up for France.

We’d already been introduced to Robespierre earlier, but here we really got to see him in action. He seems pretty cool so far. His heart is in the right place aka saving France. And he wasn’t exactly wrong either. Everything he said was the truth. The poor and still really poor in France. And we’ve seen the Queen in the Palace spend money without a care while ignoring her durities. It’s hard to defend Marie Antoinette here…

The other new character we met was Madame Polignac. It was another sign of Antoinette’s trusting heart in that she immediately pulled her into the Palace. Antoinette is the type of person who does anything she can for those she considers her friend, and is utter bored with anyone who doesn’t interest her. It’ll be interesting to see if this bites her in the butt later. We didn’t get to see much of Madame Polignac today. Just a simple introduction. It’s nice to see an act of Antoinette’s kindness in an episode condemning her, even if it’s also an act of favoritism.

So Oscar is now more aware than ever of the problems plaguing France and the growing tensions against the King and Queen. She was suspicious that it would come to this, but it’s been growing more rapidly tahn she imagined. The question now becomes; What can Oscar do? Will Oscar confront Marie Antoinette about her spending problems? Will Marie Antoinette be able to listen?

The producers could have made a Flash movie instead, and had more name recognition and put Ryan Reynolds to better use. 

Thor was great, X-Men First Class was better than anyone expected it to be, and while Captain America is still anyone's guess. it wont have to do much to be considered better than Green Lantern. 

Critics can only see comic book movies as a fad, when in reality, it is just filmmakers finding new source material.

[he also said](http://screencrush.com/bvs-snyder-batman-rule/) he tried to have batman kill people indirectly, because that's somehow morally different than killing them directly?

Shoot the car they’re in, the car blows up or the grenade would go off in the guy’s hand, or when he shoots the tank and the guy pretty much lights the tank [himself].

Map pool, ideal look to have a 6 map pool and a perma ban, my team's is Nuke as it's shit. Practice the maps you're good at. 

Build your team on a basis, many teams have a basis that they work on. Faze would be using their star players, while SK would be an execute or a double awp setup. Create something that you know you can fall back on.

Practices should be your team spectating you and you showing them. Once you have shown them, do a dry run and use the strat in a game to practice it.

Importantly, understand how your players act, if you have a player that can get triggered easily, make a rule saying that he should mute his mic, if he continues, cut him.

9918,"In western music we have major and minor scales, which originate from patterns of notes called modes. Modes are also scales, but the relationships between the pitches (the order of half and whole steps) are all different. If you want to hear all the different modes go to a piano and play all the white keys from one note to the same note and octave above. (C - C, D - D, E - E, etc). Not all of these scales will be recognizable as major or minor scales. Major and Minor scales are also known as the Ionian and Aeolian modes. They are the most commonly used modes in western music because of the arrangement of the half and whole steps. They just sound good, and if you play all the modes on the piano, you will hear that some of them are very strange sounding. They have big augmented 2cds in strange places, or just don't sound quite settled. For western classical music this makes it difficult to create ""good"" or ""even"" sounding melodies, and you have to remember the main origin of western classical music comes from the church. Most all of early classical music was commissioned for religious ceremonies in church, which limited the ""role"" of the music. Composers were trying to create music for worship, and instinctively the ionian and aeolian modes are the most singable and ""even"" sounding. However the other modes are common in very very early music from Medieval and Renaissance times (infact ""keys"" were not created until the early baroque period when Bach came around, up until then pieces were written in modes) The other modes are also still used today in a lot of Jazz and Rock.

Ok, now for the emotive associations. I go to music school and I have asked my professors why we associate major with ""happy"" and minor with ""sad"", is it programmed into us or are we conditioned to what we hear from birth and take away associations? All of my professors have said these associations are built into our brains. So you can take it at that, or not, as I haven't found any meaningful studies about it online. I am a serious musician though and I believe this. I think you can hear that the minor scale is more wandering, there are no leading tones (half steps leading to either the tonic or dominant) and even when you harmonize a melody in the minor scale it never sounds like there is any kind of strong cadential motion (V - I). In fact, the melodic minor scale which is more common in western music than the natural minor (the pure aeolian mode) ""borrows"" notes from the parallel major so the last 4 notes of the scale sound like they are from a major scale. This was an intentional alteration by early western composers in order to harmonize melodies in the aeolian mode. So overall the aeolian mode own on its doesn't inherently contain a lot of definitive motion, which makes it sound more uncertain, roaming, lost etc. The major scale is just more even in its layout of whole steps and half steps. It's constructed out of two tetrachords of identical relationships between the notes. whole-whole-whole-half, whole-whole-whole-half! It's symmetrical, and there are half-steps acting as leading tones to the two most important notes in the scale, the tonic and dominant. When you hear a major scale, it sounds like a little presentation. I know exactly where it's going. (try singing these words to a major scale, ""I am hungry, so I ate food!"" It's silly but I think it verbalizes the directness of the major scale. It doesn't sound as definitive if you sing it in minor) I think this directness is why the major scale naturally sounds ""happy"" to our ears. Again, I haven't read any written studies to support my point, but my professors and myself have discussed it at length. If you ask somebody in the music world about this I think their opinion will most likely be that these emotive associations are programmed into our brains.

Now, does this vary among cultures? Yes and no. Yes because not all cultures even use the western modes or pitch system, and no because [I believe] any human can naturally hear these associations. Our modes are based on the harmonic series, which is a naturally occurring series of pitches that are created through vibration. If I play a ""C"" on a cello, you are not just hearing the note ""C"" you are hearing a 5th above C, an octave above C, a 4th above C, a 3rd above C etc. Eventually the differences in pitch become too small to notice the difference between notes. This is how the pitches were ""picked out"" in western music, and in a lot of other cultural music around the world. It's a very natural and instinctive way to organize pitches. However, a lot of cultures employ pitches that are closer together than in western music. In middle eastern music or indian ragas, intervals smaller than a semitone are very common. Our western ears may not hear the difference between these semitones, but to those musicians/cultures/people the subtle differences in pitch are noticable and deeply expressive. In eastern music the pentatonic scale, which only has 5 notes, is of great importance. Some cultures don't even focus on pitch. Gamelon music in indonesia is just hitting different kinds of metallophones (xylophones, steel drums etc) and there isn't any kind of true harmonic relationship between any of the notes, but ""pitch"" isn't a structural pillar in that music. Nor is it in a lot of african music, which focuses a lot more on rhythm and the intertwining of of different beats over an ostinato. Basically, not only is ""pitch"" in music not a all-inclusive definition, but it's not even important in a lot of music in the world. I think though, if a non-western person heard a major or minor scale, they would be able to pick out which one is ""happy"" and which one is ""sad"", especially since pop music is all over the world now and is based in the western tonal system. And even if that person REALLY had not heard western music before, I still think they would be able to. 

that's my take. I hope it makes a little bit of sense, I'm very hungover. I also brushed over a lot of musical terms, if you want any clarification feel free to message me :D",AskReddit

Me and this kid in the neighborhood were friends when I was about 7. Now that I think about it, he was more or less using me for my pool. Anyways, he told me one day we could make money going door-to-door selling Yuogioh cards. At the time I thought it was an awesome plan, but in retrospect I lived in the wrong neighborhood to do any of this shit, especially at age 7.

We had been to about 15 houses at this point, and nobody so far wanted to buy any. However, this one guy decides he wants to buy a set of 50. He seemed like a normal guy, but I got this weird vibe from him. My 7 year old brain didn't care though; I just wanted the money.

The man told us that he didn't have the money and would have to go to the bank. He deeply insisted that we go with him despite our resistance. At that point, my aunt had come speeding down the road and stopped on a dime. She told us both to get in the car, and we did so because we were afraid that we'll get in trouble. She takes the other guy home and I got a deep scolding. My mom was about to file a police report because I was gone for around 8 hours and forgot to mention that I was leaving. Luckily my aunt found me though.

I learned when I was older that the man was a registered sex offender and that we evaded a possible kidnapping. Apparently the police questioned the guy, but he didn't get charged as he did nothing illegal. The guy moved months later.",AskReddit

10001,"The Knicks continue to stall a trade from happening, the worst they will come out of this. 

First off, they are in this situation because of their own doing. They gave Melo his NTC and trade kicker. They spent the last year or so completely trashing Melo in the media, trying tempt him to waive his NTC. They were the ones saying that they are ""motivated"" to move Melo and now they are chickening out. 

Even though most of the trashing of Melo was Phil's doing, the Knicks' higher ups and Dolan did not do anything to stop it or even show Melo some support. 

Now as they continue to stall in a trade, they are stuck because Melo still has his NTC that he is only willing to waive for 2 teams and his trade value is only going to decrease at this point. 

Holding on to Melo is something that they can do but they'll look even more pathetic around the league, especially if Melo continues to voice his displeasure. Melo is still one of the most connected/well liked players in the league with almost every big name star and agent close with him. The message of how incompetent the Knicks are treating their star player won't go unnoticed in this league. 

Having Melo there for even a season will cause a constant distraction for the Knicks that no team wants. 

The Knicks are hoping Melo will opt out next year but that's no guarantee.  As a 34 year old, he could go the D-Wade route and opt in. He'll have almost 28M reasons to opt in.  Do they really want to waste 2 seasons of this?  

Finally, they are risking alienating their franchise cornerstone to be, Porzingis. He didn't go to his exit meeting in support of Melo and it looks like he is avoiding the Knicks at all cost this offseason, even after the firing of Phil. That's definitely not a good look and very telling that he will probably bounce the first chance he gets unless something changes. 

I get the Knicks want at least something good in return for Melo but they have completely fumbled this whole situation and are looking even more incompetent with each passing day.  People around the NBA are taking note. Not saying the should straight up trade Melo for Anderson but if there's a deal on the table that they can feel at least a little bit tolerable, they need to jump on it and finish this correctly. The longer they wait, the less likely they'll get anything tolerable. ",nba

During the second fight, the DPS were taking Scythes to the face CONSTANTLY and then blaming me for not healing faster. Helya was a problem when two DPS took the barrage to the face in the first phase, and then on a second attempt, one DPS took the barrage again, leaving us 4 manning it. In the end, the DH tank soloed 2.5% of Helya's HP (which is a lot).

""Twist and Shout"", with John Lennon on lead vocals, was the last song recorded; producer George Martin knew Lennon's voice would suffer from the performance, so he left it until last, with only 15 minutes of scheduled recording time remaining.

&gt;Lennon was suffering from a cold, and was drinking milk and sucking on cough drops to soothe his throat. His coughing is audible on the album, as is the cold's effect on his voice. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker. He later said his voice was not the same for a long time afterward, and that ""every time [he] swallowed, it felt like sandpaper"".[11]

&gt;A second take was attempted, but Lennon had nothing left and it was abandoned.[12] George Martin said, ""I did try a second take ... but John's voice had gone.""[13]

It would be an incredible twist, but an entirely possible one nonetheless. It would be easy to do, too: have Dany lose a few battles, and decide to torch King's Landing with her dragons as the only way to get the throne.

Her visions in season 2 had her at a barren, snow covered iron throne, there's been multiple glimpses of a dragon flying over king's landing, multiple references to 'ruling the ashes'. There's no way to reconcile the fact that the Dothraki only value strength through rape and pillage.
At the very least we're going to come to a point where Dany realizes she can't have her cake and eat it too. Whatever she does from that point will dictate how the series ends.

I think it's far more likely Cersei sets off the rest of the Wildfire, leaving nothing left for Dany to rule, hence her vision and in it her walking away from the throne to join the fight at the wall. ",gameofthrones

There's nothing about you that is an underdog, and you deserve every painful loss you get.  You signed an old Buick we drove for over a decade with roughly 800,000 miles on him to a half-decade contract, then when he was your worst player in the playoffs, your GM backed him, exposed his partner, and kept him in the roster.

You got cucked by a Russian who dangled the possibility of leaving unless you gave him what he wanted.  You folded immediately and even admitted you got bent over!  I'm sure McClellan will be fine with cleaning up after.

10384,"The first issue is that old zones feel dated and no longer jive with the current lore. In addition, leveling has been trivialized and no longer feels rewarding. I think Blizz should have had a smaller ""cleanup"" team from the start who go through zone by zone and bring it up to the current standard after an expac has ended. Unfortunately they never instituted such a thing and by now there is too much content to clean it all up in any reasonable amount of time. The team that handled the Cata revamp did a great job on quest quality and flow, but they admitted that they spent too much time and effort on content that few people now appreciate. They seem to be set in the mindset that outdated content is not ""worth it"" to revamp, I wish they would reconsider, I like leveling through old zones and experiencing the story. 

Another related issue is that (some) people want legacy servers, if for nothing other than to experience Vanilla as it was before BC. I actually wish they would do this as part of the effort for preserving lore and letting people experience the older gameplay mechanics. This has been criticized though with claims that not enough people would want to play legacy versions of the game ""because they dont change"". If handled correctly however, I think it would be a boon to player retention and game value. 

My proposed solution to these issues is to have a dedicated team go through all the old zones and update them to a current ""after the fact"" state. Nothing fancy but a simplified questline through each zone that eventually leads up to the current expac. If zone scaling and/or world quests work in this environment, institute that too. Simultaneously release Legacy Servers for each expansion in the state it was before the last pre-patch. All the quests, raids and events are preserved on each server for its expansion. If you want to experience Legacy content, you must play on the Legacy Server, and you must start with Vanilla. Once you get to max level on that Legacy Server, you have the option to transfer that toon to the next Legacy Server in the chronology, so after Vanilla would be Burning Crusade, all the way up to the last outdated expansion. To provide additional incentives, certain achievements and rewards should be given, for example for defeating Ragnaros at level 60, or getting Vanilla Loremaster, etc. In this way you could level ""easily"" on the primary servers with no lore contradictions, or you could do it the ""hard"" way on legacy servers and get a special prize at the end. I would have only one server for each legacy expansion to keep population high, but I am sure some people would also keep toons on each legacy server for raiding and min/maxing or for PVP. 

This would take a lot of work by Blizzard so I doubt they will ever do something like this, but honestly at this point it should be trivial to institute Legacy Servers. That coupled with a revamp of all the older zones would really propel the game into a more logical state. I also would like to see access to all of the above covered with the same sub we already pay. The goal would to bring more people back who would spend time on the legacy servers while retaining people who would rather level. ",wow

10393,"First; I believe part of the problem lies within the integration process of the country, but the blame is put on the opposite side by both parties. Ethnic Norwegians and immigrants.

Whereas Immigrants need to understand the behavior and cultural social norms of their past are needed to be, not necessarily disposed but conformed to their new society. That they cant expect their ideology to be forced onto others in the same sense ans others forcing onto them. 

While Norwegian ethnics need to understand that generalization of a general term of immigrants that overlap a vast majority of cultures and religions does not help in any form the possibilities of successful assimilations into said society.

Immigrants come to this country and receive instant denial, overbearing rejection, mockery of their whole identity by a society that should be open and more socially intellectual. The mass medias over hyped, sensationalized reporting of events that point out INDIVIDUALS within communities, that are radical and against the norm, to portray them as the general voice of said community, is a contributor to increased fear mongering and generalization on the subject of immigration and immigrants which results in further segregation of the two parties. There is evident failure of assimilation and integration, grønland is the perfect example of such failure, whereas foreign cultures have completely taken over the area to allow a society that does not need interaction with any Norwegian norms to continue to function. The segregation has caused a paranoia within immigrants that ethnic Norwegians have no desire to associate themselves with immigrants, they fear if they leave their cultural safe houses they will be met with further stigmatization and racism that would enclose what ever form of social activities they have now.

From Norwegian ethnics viewpoint, They see most immigrants as not members of their community but as foreigners who come to gain the benefits without having to integrate or assimilate towards their norms and force their own ideals upon the ethnic Norwegians. For them their viewpoint of the segregation shows that lack of desire to assimilate into the Norwegian society and adhere to the Norwegian laws, so they seek to confine themselves to safety by minimizing any interaction with immigrants at all. They also receive berating comments and harassment at times from younger generation of immigrants who in my mind lash out because of a young idealistic mindset of being already considered beasts they might as well behave as such.

**As for the case of rapes, per wikipedias numbers, todays immigrants in Oslo are about 25%, out of the 86 cases of rape , lets divide that number by 5 so ; 18 cases of rape per year on average. SO should those 18 people, be spokespersons for 150 000 Immigrants living in Oslo today?  We also have to take into consideration the subject upon which this data is presented, rape which is a subject females do not easily report for personal reasons. So i don't want to confirm to the statistics that 100% of all rapes are committed by immigrants. **

**But again this comes down to improper assimilation and integration of immigrants into Norwegian society, i believe these people should be extradited back to their home countries for committing such crimes, because the  Norwegian prison system is a luxury for them rather than a punishment. With concise strict extradition laws on any major crimes within the first 5 years for immigrants, would help to downplay the potential repeats of such behavior. BUT it doesn't rule out the problem that these individuals are using their ideology or religion as excuses to act out on these urges, it would be like saying people who are not religious never commit rapes, there will always exist deranged delusional people who enjoy committing evil acts, the possibility of becoming such person is greater when they come from backgrounds that have such instability and insecurity that many of these immigrants come from.** 

**But this doesn't mean all immigrants will become like this, it would be equal to say all right wing Norwegians can become like this madman. With proper assimilation, just basic understanding and respect. We can bridge the gap that allows such behavior to be even considered accepted before it even occurs**


The only way to ensure a better Norway is through proper educational process and assimilation programs, integration of immigrants without having to lose cultural values and beliefs is a much more likely result. Whereas todays lack of follow through, greater segregation between the groups, and greater generalized paranoia about ""potential risks"" create a almsot impossible scenario of successful integration and assimilation of immigrants.

European Catholicism was definitely not culturally similar to Protestant America. There was a great cultural divide between the two. Hence years of discrimination and isolation in ethnic neighborhoods. That lasted for a long time.

So what? Conservative Catholicism in the 19th century would have culturally more in common with conservative Islam than liberal Protestantism in the US.

Europe is hugely diverse and has a ton of ethnicities and cultures. Lumping them together makes no sense. There are cultures in Europe that would find more in common With the middle East than they would another part of Europe.


&gt;Those are some massive differences you've chosen to just ignore for the sake of convenience my dude

A few Things I found right off the bat:


&gt; ""Overwatch's short list of prospective agents included two members of the soldier enhancement program: Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, a senior officer. ""

Morrison and Reyes happened to be one of multiple enhanced soldiers Genji, for example, I thought he was just a normal guy who had some fancy omnic running boots made from the skins of his vanquished robotic enemies. Guess Mcree really is the only cool *normal* dude living off his own skills.


&gt;""Leadership of Overwatch fell to Reyes, but Morrison would have a greater impact on the group in the long term. He brought out the best in the people around him and helped mold Overwatch's diverse (and sometimes conflicting) agents into a cohesive fighting force""  ""The UN rewarded Morrison for his contributions by making him Overwatch's first official commander. Reyes was passed over in the process, and it created a rift between the two men that would lead to tragic consequences.""

**Here's the juicy bit,** Reyes was seemingly less fond of Morrison than I had believed, and several other instances praise Morrison, with anecdotal references of any accomplishments by Reyes. Imagine entering the military, only for the new guy, however likable he may be, to steal all the glory and  fame after you've been working hard and devoting your entire self to hard work and getting better. I would resent nearly anyone for that, and it wouldn't matter whether I was friendly with them, because at the core I would despise them for being everything I'm not.

&gt;""Two decades after Overwatch ended the Omnic Crisis and saved humanity, it was brought to its knees by a series of shocking allegations: negligence resulting in high-profile mission failures; corruption and mismanagement; weapons proliferation; human rights abuses; and more.""

&gt;""A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims.""

&gt;""As the UN investigation proceeded, Overwatch's Swiss headquarters was destroyed in an apparent accident. Among the casualties were Morrison and Reyes.""

&gt;""After Morrison's promotion to strike commander, his relationship with Reyes changed,"" Dr. Angela Ziegler, medical director of Overwatch, stated during a UN committee hearing. ""The tension became more pronounced as time went on. I tried to mend things. We all did. Sometimes when the closest bonds break, all you can do is pray you stay out of the cross fire.""

So we were both right! There was certainly foul play, and they had ""the closest bonds"". Now that I've reread that all, I wish there were more instances of interaction between the two, as they are an excellent pair and deserve more fleshing out of their current feelings and beliefs. Guess I'll just have to wait for blizzard though. And after seeing the differences between their methods, with Reyes believing OverWatch and Blackwatch to be outside the law, and Morrison defending the image of Overwatch *Being* law (or at least an example of order, peace and general good).

Glad I could think out loud to force myself to analyze that as well as I could with the subtext of ""This isn't just for me"", and thanks for putting up with my mediocre summary of what is a great world building article.",Overwatch

However, harder drugs are way too low imho, it doesn't take long to be able to go through 1 gram of heroin or 2 grams of cocaine in a couple days with habitual use, much less 10-days.

That is not a lot to work with unless we go into visions/dream territory that GoT completely reserved for Bran.

Maybe just show him drowning in the black ocean or even hit the ocean floor softly then cut away. Then later wash him up on a beach, apparently dead, suddenly choking back to life. 

Then either let him act erratic/ extremely determined or surround him with heaps of visual symbols, cues and omens that this is the working of the drowned god.

10889,"&gt; I say circumcision because that is the procedure people mean they use male genital mutilation.

Sure, and yet you use the term female circumcision when talking about any form of it, even the ones that are less harmful or equally harmful.

At least I'm honest, I call both of them circumcision.

&gt;When articles like this is posted and people think of FGM I doubt the procedure they're talking about is a pinprick on the clitoris like some people like to bring up. It's the removal of the clitoris, the labia, or sewing up of the vaginal opening.

No, they're not thinking about a symbolic pricking. But I repeat, **all of it is illegal**. But male circumcision isn't. See the problem?

&gt;Compare it to circumcision where there is research that it reduces HIV transmission, phimosis, etc. Seeing it as acceptable is justified in Western standards and allowed here because there is a belief of health benefits. If there was zero research and the only reason they have was that they want men to be pure and not enjoy sex, I doubt it could be justified here.

Except the research is all post-hoc bullshit done to justify circumcision, not the other way around.

Phimosis is a non-issue, as infants cannot even retract the foreskin anyway. Phimosis cannot be diagnosed in an infant, and it's not a major problem anyway. 

For HIV, you only get the ""benefit"" of having a *slightly* lower risk of transmission **when having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive person**. 

Again, this is clearly not a good enough reason to justify circumcision. All of it is post-hoc done by Americans to justify it, which is why [almost every medical association](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zsd8c/one_of_you_has_repeatedly_posted_a_fantastic/c67h34g/) other than American ones condemn circumcision.

E.g.

&gt;[Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) (2010)](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf)
The KNMG states “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” It regards the non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors as a violation of physical integrity, and argues that boys should be able to make their own decisions about circumcision.

&gt;And your entire quotation is essentially complications of botched circumcisions.

No, it isn't. What it was talking about is what's happening to boys and men in Africa. 

Do you think that boys and men in African villages are being circumcised by a doctor in a sterile hospital? No.

Which is why it's dishonest to compare female circumcision done in Africa to male circumcision done in Canada.

Morgan ran home with the sole intention of running over the Marlins catcher. Morgan was out, and the catchers season was over.

10904,"&gt; The fact is that there was admittedly some actual freefall that occurred, and the rest of the building fell at near free fall speed.

Logically, that is untrue. The building *overall* took 40% longer to collapse than a true free-fall. That is not ""near"" to free-fall at all, especially when you consider that a large portion of that time it was free-falling, so therefore the time when it wasn't must have been significantly slower than 40%.

The explanation - that the initial collapse occurred in the lower section and started 'slowly', and then the upper section collapsed without resistance into the empty space left behind after Stage 1 - is plausible. 

That debris from the Twin Towers set it aflame in multiple places is plausible.

That the fire went unchecked because emergency services were already overwhelmed and water supply cut-off is plausible.

That the outer frame of the building collapsed 'symmetrically' because the inside support widely failed first (because of unchecked fires) leaving it as a relatively stronger shell which collapsed suddenly and totally is plausible, to me.

All these things are more plausible than lasers, or nukes, or somehow rigging the building for a demolition with nobody noticing. Scientifically, logically.

&gt; Out of curiosity, where does your resistance to this theory come from?

I appraise each theory on its own merits, and place more weight on those which are strongest logically. Given the vast amount of mutually exclusive 'truths' flying around out there IMO the 'official' story simply ticks more boxes than any of the others, and requires less leaps of faith for validity. 

I certainly don't assume the US gov is innocent in all things, my flavour of conspiracies just trends toward the more mundane, something like Iran/Contra or CIA drug smuggling (I dabble in JFK conspiracies too), or wars based on blatant deceptions by TPTB.

I just need a good reason to think something is so; sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Most Truthers start at 'inside job' and work backwards from there (and boy does it get whacky sometimes). That's not rational thinking, it's fantasizing.

Controlled demos fall faster than WTC7, but then someone will say: 'well they would try to make it look that way', you might then beg the question: 'well why then make look like a demo at all? (if in fact it truly looks like a demo)'; or, you might not bother and leave the kooks to their earthquake machines and space lasers.

They do this by using the information that lenders provide to them. However they also rate those very same lenders.... so if a lender doesn't like their own rating they may stop giving the rating agency information making the rating agency less useful. Thus rating agencies have an incentive to always rate large lenders high. 

Individuals are also rated by the agencies but are not as big a priority. Often times information on individuals is left out or not accurate and the agencies don't really care unless the  businesses that pay them complain about it. I have on countless occasions done credit checks on businesses that appear to be clean.... only to see them declare bankruptcy within the next year.

&gt; Yelle is a trio formed in Saint-Brieuc, France in 2005, of lead singer Julie Budet (aka Yelle) and Jean-François Perrier (aka GrandMarnier), with Tanguy Destable (aka Tepr) joining prior to their début album.

&gt; Budet rose to fame on MySpace when she posted a song titled ""Short Dick Cuizi"", dissing Cuizinier, a member of the Parisian hip-hop group TTC.

&gt; With producer and close friend GrandMarnier, Budet has recorded a début album Pop-Up, after her hit single ""Je veux te voir"" (a finalised version of ""Short Dick Cuizi""). The song, which samples the bassline from 20 Fingers' 1994 club hit Short Dick Man, received heavy airplay on MTV. She was also featured on Fatal Bazooka's song ""Parle à ma main"" in 2007. In February 2008 she performed the track ""À cause des Garçons"" on the BBC Three series ""Lily Allen and Friends"". The series claimed that this was her first appearance on UK television. She was MTV's 'Artist of the Week' for the week of 24th March-30th March 2008, appearing during adverts.

&gt; Yelle's second single ""A cause des garçons/ACDG"" is a cover song from an homonym 80's French band. A remixed version of the track by Riot in Belgium was featured on the soundtrack of Electronic Arts' computer game; Need for Speed: ProStreet. The song was also used as the opening song for the Moschino Spring Summer 2008 runway show

&gt; As of 2008, it is also featured in an advert being broadcast in Quebec for Telus, a Canadian telecommucations company and the 24th March episode of 'The Hills'. Her single ""Je veux te voir"" was featured on the series 4 final episode of Entourage, in the opening scene when the gang arrives in Cannes, and her single ""Ce jeu"" was played on Gap's and H &amp; M's shop soundtrack in summer 2008.

&gt; The DJ Tepr has been touring with her and already remixed three Yelle's songs ""A cause des garçons/ACDG"" , ""Je veux te Voir/Short Dick Cuizi"" and ""Ce Jeu"".

11196,"It is a combination of the  glass and the ceramic together.

""Safety Glass"" is designed to fracture into small, non jagged polygons.  It does this by having a high surface tension layer relative to the rest of the glass.  A similar (or at least analogous), ""macro"" version of this is what happens with [dried lake beds](http://i.imgur.com/4l3xgUG.jpg) but instead of at an atomic scale, and instantly, like glass... it is at a relatively massive scale, and very slowly.  Safety Glass also has a property called ""Hardness"" (as defined by a material's resistance to scratching) which is sometimes measured using ""Mohs Hardness Scale""... a score from 1 - 10 (higher is more hard, pure diamond is the hardest with a score of 10).  Safety Glass in side windows is ~7.

These ""Ninja Rocks"" as they are sometimes called are made from Aluminum Oxide which has a Mohs score of 9... so almost diamond level hardness.  That means when it fractures, the edges and points are extremely durable to impact.  Just like a knife is better at cutting meat than a flat bar made of the same steel, those points can, with a minimal amount of energy, penetrate the less hard glass surface, thereby releasing the tension inherent in the glass and ""popping"" it like a balloon.

So while density (mass to volume) is a way of putting more energy into impact (depleted uranium rounds for example), that isn't the most important factor here.  [Here is a dramatic demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=44&amp;v=h_QeBqyWuDE) of where ""more energy"" is trumped by ""sharp and hard"".

As long as the government stays in denial about Brexit’s drawbacks, the country is on course for disaster

Jul 22nd 2017

CRISIS? What crisis? So many have been triggered in Britain by the vote a year ago to leave the European Union that it is hard to keep track. Just last month Theresa May was reduced from unassailable iron lady to just-about-managing minority prime minister. Her cabinet is engaged in open warfare as rivals position themselves to replace her. The Labour Party, which has been taken over by a hard-left admirer of Hugo Chávez, is ahead in the polls. Meanwhile a neurotic pro-Brexit press shrieks that anyone who voices doubts about the country’s direction is an unpatriotic traitor. Britain is having a very public nervous breakdown.

The chaos at the heart of government hardly bodes well for the exit negotiations with the EU, which turned to detailed matters this week and need to conclude in autumn 2018. But the day-to-day disorder masks a bigger problem. Despite the frantic political activity in Westminster—the briefing, back-stabbing and plotting—the country has made remarkably little progress since the referendum in deciding what form Brexit should take. All versions, however “hard” or “soft”, have drawbacks (see article). Yet Britain’s leaders have scarcely acknowledged that exit will involve compromises, let alone how damaging they are likely to be. The longer they fail to face up to Brexit’s painful trade-offs, the more brutal will be the eventual reckoning with reality.

**Winging it**  
In the 13 months since the referendum, the awesome complexity of ending a 44-year political and economic union has become clear. Britain’s position on everything from mackerel stocks to nuclear waste is being worked out by a civil service whose headcount has fallen by nearly a quarter in the past decade and which has not negotiated a trade deal of its own in a generation. Responsibility for Brexit is shared—or, rather, fought over and sometimes dropped—by several different departments. Initially Britain’s decision not to publish a detailed negotiating position, as the EU had, was put down to its desire to avoid giving away its hand. It now seems that Britain triggered exit talks before working out where it stood. The head of its public-spending watchdog said recently that when he asked ministers for their plan he was given only “vague” assurances; he fears the whole thing could fall apart “at the first tap”.

As the scale of the task has become apparent, so has the difficulty of Britain’s position. Before the referendum Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer in the cabinet, predicted that, “The day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards.” It is not turning out like that. So far, where there has been disagreement Britain has given way. The talks will be sequenced along the lines suggested by the EU. Britain has conceded that it will pay an exit bill, contrary to its foreign secretary’s suggestion only a week ago that Eurocrats could “go whistle” for their money.

The hobbled Mrs May has appealed to other parties to come forward with ideas on how to make Brexit work. Labour, which can hardly believe that it is within sight of installing a radical socialist prime minister in 10 Downing Street, is unsurprisingly more interested in provoking an election. But cross-party gangs of Remainer MPs are planning to add amendments to legislation, forcing the government to try to maintain membership of Euratom, for instance, which governs the transit of radioactive material in Europe. Even within the government, the prime minister’s lack of grip means that cabinet ministers have started openly disagreeing about what shape Brexit should take. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been sniped at because he supports a long transition period to make Brexit go smoothly—a sensible idea which is viewed with suspicion by some Brexiteers, who fear the transition stage could become permanent.

The reopening of the debate is welcome, since the hard exit proposed in Mrs May’s rejected manifesto would have been needlessly damaging. But there is a lack of realism on all sides about what Britain’s limited options involve. There are many ways to leave the EU, and none is free of problems. The more Britain aims to preserve its economic relationship with the continent, the more it will have to follow rules set by foreign politicians and enforced by foreign judges (including on the sensitive issue of freedom of movement). The more control it demands over its borders and laws, the harder it will find it to do business with its biggest market. It is not unpatriotic to be frank about these trade-offs. Indeed, it is more unpatriotic to kid voters into thinking that Brexit has no drawbacks at all.

The government has not published any estimates of the impact of the various types of Brexit since the referendum, but academic studies suggest that even the “softest” option—Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Area—would cut trade by at least 20% over ten years, whereas the “hardest” exit, reverting to trade on the World Trade Organisation’s terms, would reduce trade by 40% and cut annual income per person by 2.6%. As the economy weakens, these concerns will weigh more heavily. Britain’s economy is growing more slowly than that of any other member of the EU. The election showed that its voters are sick of austerity. Our own polling finds that, when forced to choose, a majority now favours a soft Brexit, inside the single market (see article). 

**Back in play**  
A febrile mood in the country, and the power vacuum in Downing Street, mean that all options are back on the table. This is panicking people on both sides of the debate. Some hardline Brexiteers are agitating again for Britain to walk away from the negotiations with no deal, before voters have a change of heart. Some Remainers are stepping up calls for a second referendum, to give the country a route out of the deepening mess. As the negotiations blunder on and the deadline draws nearer, such talk will become only more fevered.

So it is all the more crucial that all sides face up to the real and painful trade-offs that Brexit entails. The longer Britain keeps its head in the sand, the more likely it is to end up with no deal, and no preparations for the consequences. That would bring a crisis of a new order of magnitude.

It's a coil and a ferrous element, and in the case of a high end specimen, insanely sensitive to all sorts of distortions.

It literally generates a signal from magnetic relationships between the two, where in this case, the coil moves as a result of the stylus and cantilever traveling the surface of the record.

Local neighboring distortions have a measurable impact - and often an audible one. Simply pick up a turntable and move it near your amps power supply.

Now imagine, if you will, that 'noise floor' isn't a single frequency, but many - and at many different amplitudes. Now overlay them and realize that they are conjunctive.

A room being filled with other forms of magnetic radiation does not necessarily reduce, or render opaque, another source that is infinitely closer (think 1/16th of an inch, depending on VTA and suspension).

What is shown in this sample group of one, is that there is an impact in an audible range.

Also, it's germane to this discussion that the presence of distortion from wiring, lights, the amplifier and so on doesn't have the same influence at varying distances, and isn't acting to cancel or obfuscate the input of other variable or similar distortions.

If anything, the article linked was provided as a counter-example to the 'closed case' that this is all just a load of BS. The case isn't closed, and I haven't seen evidence supplied by you or anyone else that supports that the distortion being addressed here is beneath the signal level, or at odds with common household distortions. Yet here we are... 

On the other hand, I have a test that is flawed and published in an industry magazine that may not be impartial, in response to swath of skeptics, where they failed to succeed in disproving the products stated effect after setting their own test guidelines.

Neither thing proves or disproves anything we are going to discuss today, here, on the internet - to a conclusive end.

All we have here are two opinions, one article that uses a sample group of one to prove an audible effect and... well...

I was a little crazy as a youth (15 years old) and I got sent away to be evaluated at a hospital and they would up drugging me and I woke up in some ward and they kept me there for 3 weeks.
Then I was able to go home for the first time. 
I went down to my room, which was in the basement and I was stuck there as a bunch of adults sat upstairs.
I knew that I had some weed, somewhere, even if it was only rez. Then I realized that I had nothing, no papers, no lighter...nothing.
Feeling like shit, I decided to search everywhere and I eventually stumbled upon a CD case with a pack of rolling papers in it.
Minutes later I found a lighter.
It was a little frustrating because I now knew that I had everything in the making except for the weed. I had no escape from the basement, but the basement had windows. All I needed was some herb, even if I just found a roach, I could empty it into the new paper. I had been nearly a month without smoking, I knew that shit would get me high.

So I am digging through all my drawers and I began to notice small accumulations here and there and I start to put them together. This may be the smallest joint ever, but it *will be* a joint.

So I began to realize how hard it is going to be to roll this thing. But I have nothing but time on my side. I figured I could really take my time and produce a perfect little pin-joint that will probably burn to ash within 2 hits. But I *would* get two hits.

Fuck. This is going to take a while. I should put on some music. I press the CD-tray eject to put in a CD but nothing happens. WTF? I begin to try everything, from sticking a knife into the ejector to banging the top of the player. Nothing works.

O' Hell No. You can take my weed God, but you wont take my music too. Not today. I unplug the CD player and begin to go nuts trying to get the ejector to open. Now that it is unplugged, I really cram the knife into the slit and I begin to work that shit. Remember, this was back in the 90's where the CD went on a little tray that sucked in and out of the machine.

So I get it to budge and I grab the tip of the CD tray. I am pulling but it feels like something is stuck. As I yank, I realize that there *is* something stuck inside the CD player.

I then get a flashback to the last 15 minutes before being sent away, my parents bugging out, me thinking I needed to find a place to hide my stash. A place that nobody would ever find it. I was also at a solid [10] while planning this out, because I knew that they may try to keep me at the hospital for more than a night, I knew my parents tricks.

As I finally get the CD tray to come out, what do I see? A huge quarter of bud in a plastic bag that is nearly ripped to shit. 

Looking back at it, 13 years later, I know that I really needed that humongous joint that I ended up smoking. Saved my life really.",trees

&gt; The Replacements are an alternative rock group that formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979. The band originally started off as a hardcore punk outfit but began to incorporate folk and power pop influences in their sound. They become one of the leaders of the early alt-folk set and one of the flagship bands of the American 80s post-punk scene, being as well a major influence on 90s indie rock.  

&gt; The band's best known lineup consisted of Paul Westerberg (vocals, guitar), Bob Stinson  (guitar), Tommy Stinson (bass) and  Chris Mars (drums). They were infamous for their abrasive, hard drinking lifestyles and their ragged stage performances, notorious for coming to some shows too drunk to play very well at all. Sometimes, they just performed entire sets of covers, their picks showing their debt to 70s hard rock outfits.

&gt; The sound of this band showed off what their many fans saw as the very best of independent rock n' roll. More than possibly any other band since The Rolling Stones and the the Ramones, the Replacements embodied the spirit of rock, from their raucous performances, drug addictions, charismatic and romantic frontman, and wild, sometimes basic and sometimes powerfully confessional songs. At any given time, almost any list of 'The Best Rock Albums Of All Time' will include either the album 'Let It Be' or 'Tim', sometimes both.

&gt; Their sound started off as a classic rock influenced shade of punk, mutating to a melodic hardcore sound reminiscent of local buddies Hüsker Dü. They also progressed into a relatively straightforward but heartfelt rock style, with a number of highly soulful ballads from the heart of Westerberg to round out the mix. 

&gt; The band broke up in 1991. Bob Stinson, who was fired from the band in 1986 (and was subsequently replaced by Slim Dunlap), died in 1995. Westerberg and Mars both have solo careers, and Tommy Stinson formed several bands, like Perfect and Bash and Pop, and now plays bass for Guns and Roses and Soul Asylum. 

&gt; In 2012, Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson reformed the Replacements and recorded an EP, ""Songs for Slim"" as a benefit for former member Slim Dunlap, who had suffered a stroke. The band played their first show since 1991 on August 24, 2013 at RiotFest in Toronto, and has since played at several festivals since. The band also currently includes Josh Freese on drums and Dave Minehan on guitar. The band played its final show in June 2015. Read more on Last.fm.

11451,"&gt;  In 2016, Micah Zenko and Amelia Mae Wolf of the Council on Foreign Relations reported that “The Obama administration’s assumption that drones cause less collateral damage than piloted aircraft is simply untrue. According to the best publicly available evidence, drone strikes in non-battlefield settings — Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia — **result in 35 times more civilian fatalities** than airstrikes by manned weapons systems in conventional battlefields, such as Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.”

...

&gt;But the United States found a solution to the problem of “collateral damage.” The Obama administration defined the problem out of existence by **assuming that any male of military age in a war zone is a militant and worthy of execution** in a “signature” strike. In most of these strikes, the U.S. has no way of knowing whether those targeted were terrorists.

Top logic. How do they identify the age of possible militants I wonder?


&gt;Per international humanitarian law, drones can only be used with bombs in an active armed conflict and even then with certain restrictions including military necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality. Only combatants or civilians who are directly participating in hostilities may be targeted. **Targeting of other civilians is prohibited and may constitute a war crime.** How much the US government is respecting these principles, Lisa, using drones both as surveillance and bombs?

I'm sure the U.S. military would never suppress any footage of possible war crimes! Never!


&gt; Trump, on the other hand, has given carte blanche to his generals. **He says he “trusts” his generals to make military decisions and leaves it up to them. As a result, the number of drone strikes has actually risen dramatically since Trump took office.**

&gt;**As a result, the number of civilian deaths has skyrocketed.** Whereas Obama had sharply limited CIA involvement in drone warfare, Trump has expanded the CIA’s role.

Personally I find it ridiculous to believe that there are not differences between how genders are treated between different countries. Just because they currently do not have difficulties with sexual harassment in the military, does not mean that you won't have that problem. The Gender Gap index is hardly a good measure for how ready one's military is to handle a large number of women serving there.

In the last two years he is better in just standard CORSI and FENWICK despite being on a much much worse team (one of the worst two years ago, wild card team this year vs Stanley cup winners). 

As for PPG Letang is probably slightly better offensively but keep in mind that Letang was playing on the best offensive team in the league and was starting on the 3rd best poweplay in the league vs Hamilton who is on a bottom half offensive team and is on the second PP unit (Calgary plays 4 forwards +Giordano on the top line) of a 10th ranked pp team (worst in the league the year before) ",hockey

This is a matter covered in [Bill C-45](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-45/first-reading) as it falls under the criminal code for possession of a substance. Of course this won't be the final version of the bill, but it's what we have to work with right now. To reference the relevant part:

&gt; **8** **(1)** Unless authorized under this Act, it is prohibited

&gt; **(a)** for an individual who is 18 years of age or older to possess, in a public place, cannabis of one or more classes of cannabis the total amount of which, as determined in accordance with Schedule 3, is equivalent to more than 30 g of dried cannabis;

So as the bill is now you'll be able to possess up to 30g of dried cannabis in public if you're 18 or older.

&gt; What should the legal limit be before it's considered over?

This will also be covered by the federal legislation as it would be pertaining to the criminal code. The legal limit for Colorado, for example, is 5 nanograms per ml of blood which is likely along the lines of what we can expect the limit to be in Canada as well. We'll have to wait and see what they decide to set it as.

&gt; How do we do roadside tests? What are the protocols? Are there more than one tests?

An approved screening device (ASD) is what officers use to determine the level of alcohol impairment in one's body (breathalyzer). The ASD to identify the presence of drugs in one's body has yet to be chosen, but when it is the ASD will be able to screen for the following drugs: cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines. The ASD will likely be included in part of Bill C-46 as all ASDs *must* be legislated for officers to use. The police powers will be granted through Bill C-46 which contains the amendments which will allow for officers to go straight for the ASD sample regardless of reasonable probable grounds. This includes going straight to breathalyzer or drug ASD for both alcohol or drug-impaired driving. 

Provincial sanctions may also be expanded upon when it comes time for the provinces to decide how they wish to manage the cannabis legislation. This could take the form of increased penalties and fines for operating under the influence of a drug or 24-hour licence suspensions. Provincial sanctions are already in place for all provinces and territories which give officers the ability to give you a 24-hour licence suspension if they have reason to believe that you are unable to operate your motor vehicle for *any* reason, this does not necessarily have to be alcohol or drug related. We'll have to wait and see what the provinces and territories decide to do.

Criminal stuff will be handled by the federal government where as the framework for distribution etc. will be handled by the provincial government.

The body scanners have gone up detect anything that you might be trying to take with you.  Federal Reserve Notes have at the minimum have enough iron in the ink to be detectable in larger quantities, perhaps even just thousands of dollars.  Being able to detect colored diamonds is the dream.  When you head off with less than $10k on your person you will likely be detected and your money will at some point be separated from you.  Your money will be in one room and you will be in another room.  Questions will be asked and at this moment you are no longer in control of your wealth.

11694,"&gt;so your defense here is that you're ignorant to NFL contracts and for some reason believe that if a player has no guaranteed money left on their contract they're not under contract?

No I live here in the real world where we know that a contract with no guaranteed money means nothing for a player and they have no negotiating power.

He could have asked for his release which the team would have certainly granted him. He could have said I will not play for less etc. He didn't, he negotiated with the team all the way up until they realized they could not make a fair agreement and they cut him.

It is not the teams responsibility to pay someone more than they are worth just because the two sides are negotiating. You are acting as if Harris was asking to be released and the Jets refused. Also don't put words in my mouth to try and make your crappy argument. I didn't say he was asking for more money. I said he was asking to be overpaid. Than he went and signed for less that 50 cents on the dollar somewhere else.

He than went and signed somewhere else for the money the Jets were offering him. As I said that is fine but don't cry that the Jets screwed you because they didn't overpay you.

&gt;There is absolutely no reason Harris should have reworked that contract and took whatever change the Jets threw at him. He's still a good player. He was picked up by the best team in the league and paid more than the Jets were offering to pay him. That alone shows he had no reason to bend a knee and kiss the proverbial ring of the Jets.

Stop making things up. I don't care if he wanted to leave, that is fine. What I said is don't cry that the team screwed you over and act like they tossed you aside. 

The Jets made him a fair offer, he refused. He than took that same offer somewhere else. As I said that is fine but don't cry about it. He could have stayed if he wanted.

That is the other bullshit thing about what you are saying. You are acting as if the Jets were lowballing him when you paid him the same thing the Jets were offering him. Yet somehow the Jets offer was screwing him and the Pats offer was a fair deal?

What the fuck is your point? Your claim was that they can get the money, and then misuse it without being able to be cut off from future funds. That was the claim made in your previous post.

That is factually incorrect. If they misuse the money in any given year, we can cut them off of funds the next year.

&gt;Plus every payment is final for that year.

No shit. If they want to cut themselves off of a massive sum of money over the span of 2 decades just to misuse a pittance of funding for just one year, they can go right ahead.

Personally, I don't consider Nashor's a core on anybody. It's a horribly expensive item... you can consider it as a last luxury item, but rushing it just isn't worth it. 

There's 2 build orders that I like to build, depending on the lane match-up (Kayle can easily take a solo lane, and she should do so, in order to maximize her farm... putting her bottom with an AD carry is such a sin)

**#1:**
If I'm laning versus a ranged champion I like getting a philo stone+boots ASAP and then rush a Sheen, because, chances are, your enemy will have a snare/slow/stun and you really want to do some damage to him, either to try and zone him out, or lower his HP so he can be ganked more easily, and this is what Sheen helps with, it gives you a bit of burst in 1-2 attacks. After the Sheen I build a Deathcap, and then try to farm for a lichbane. The core items here are Sheen+Deathcap, it gives you great burst damage, and a good heal.

**#2:**
The second build is for when I lane against a melee champion. Core items are Rageblade+Shen. Cheaper core build, very effective against melee champions cause you'll want to trade blows with them more often than not and Sheen+Deathcap just doesn't give you that. I'm still sort of experimenting on her builds, and I'm trying to find a place for the Gunblade somewhere in it.... Rageblade+Cutlass+Sheen might be worth a try.

&gt; Groove Armada is an electronic music group from Cambridge, United Kingdom, composed of two members, Andy Cato (real name Andrew Cocup) and Tom Findlay. They first came to fame with a 1997 limited single release, At the River (made famous after being used in various Marks &amp; Spencer advertisements), which sampled ""Old Cape Cod"" by Patti Page. The song has since made its way onto numerous chill-out compilations.

&gt; Their most famous work is the 2000 international hit I See You Baby, remixed by Fatboy Slim in the Big Beat style -- with the repeated chorus line ""Shakin' that ass,"" as heard in Renault Mégane advertisements. Vocals were provided by Ibiza-based DJ Gram'Ma Funk. Incidentally, this track was also recorded with the chorus line ""Shakin' that thang"" as a radio edit. While this is their most famous work, they have also produced less mainstream songs which are often featured in television adverts.

&gt; In the early part-of 2008 after parting company with Sony BMG, Groove Armada signed an ""all encompassing deal"" with the Bacardi rum brand that allows them to use GA's tracks for adverts.  For more information, read Bands turn to brands in new deals

&gt;     * Groove Armada's Suntoucher was sampled by Jay-Z for the song ""What More Can I Say"" on his Black Album.

&gt;     * The track Hands of Time is featured in the movie Collateral, and is referred to by one of the characters as a ""classic song."" It is also featured in the television series Cold Case; it was played as the ending song in the episode entitled Street Money, from the show's sixth season.

&gt;     * Groove Armada's debut album was Northern Star, released in 1998.

&gt;     * In 1999, Groove Armada released Vertigo, which had a more polished, mainstream sound. This album includes ""At The River,"" which was re-released as a single (#23 UK).

&gt;     * In 2001, Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub was released, with the title suggesting their new album was more upbeat and less geared toward chilling out -- as demonstrated by the single ""Superstylin'"" (#5 UK).

&gt;     * In 2002, they released the DJ mix album Another Late Night: Groove Armada, part of the Another Late Night series on Azuli Records.

&gt;     * In 2002, less than a year after Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub, Groove Armada produced Lovebox, which incorporated a variety of genres. Some tracks, such as ""Madder,"" featured a rock element, while others, such as ""Lovebox"" and ""Remember,"" were closer to traditional house. ""Remember"" has vocals made up entirely of samples of Sandy Denny singing at Fairport.

&gt;     * In 2004, Groove Armada released a best-of album, which included hits and new productions (#6 UK).

&gt;     * In May 2007 Soundboy Rock was released, featuring the track Get Down. Guest appearances include M.A.D., Red Rat and Mutya Buena (see: Sugababes). The album was released on CD, Vinyl, and also as a limited CD package with 2 bonus tracks.

&gt;  * In March 2010 Black Light, their 6th studio album, was released.

he's put up stupid good numbers and been a force in every other finals, even in his run against the spurs when he was the driving force all on his own on the cavs

even despite it being lebron james, and his 'super teams'.. they're only super because of him, and lebron has actually been the underdog in finals more often than not going by vegas odds

i would argue the warriors have always been a better team then the cavs, so it's not really that super

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I also concede that Lacazette and Icarus are in the conversation as well. I really like Lukaku he's one of my favorite players to watch and I hope he does well at Man Utd.

I also agree that Griezmann and Dybala are not number 9's, just like Muller. While they can play there, that is not their best positions. And while they are all better overall players than Lukaku, he is absolutely a better number 9 than them. Really I was just refuting your claim that 16 goals was shit.",soccer

This is the same cancer that has been eating away at the right, and while it's always existed to some degree in the left, the Russian saga has brought it mainstream. There IS a Russia story and it's a damn serious one. I don't understand why people can't be content following the facts which are quickly developing without piling on fantasies. 

This ~half page article tells is that a man who once claimed he tried to get info from the Russians was found to have commit suicide and in his note stated it was not foul play. Okay those are the only facts of the article. The hot headline is supposed to get people like you all fired up thinking that this was a Russian assassination - gasp! Outrage! Pitch forks! 

This is also a man who made his Russian hacker contact attempts public, inference - attention seeker. Could this also explain his note - yes. Could it also be that he thought suspicion would be cast on his death and the sentiment in his note was a genuine attempt at clearing things up - yes. Is it logical - Not really, but how clear and logical should we really expect someone to be if they are of a state of mind to carry out suicide (even if it was for supposedly calculated financial purposes)? Is it more likely that he was assassinated by a foreign agent than it is that he was depressed and/or desperate for money? 

There are approximately 121 suicides in the US per day, excuse me if I think it's inappropriate to assume he was murdered by a foreign agent. This is exactly where this becomes Fox News/Breitbart style conspiracy thinking. The burden of proof is not on the rest of the world to convince you that it WAS'T an assassination. It's on you to prove that it is. And the article makes no effort to do so as there are no actual supporting facts.

Yes. Just like I would do if someone said that the Patriots didn't suck. Religion gets no special pass.

If they were sitting against a wall with a sign that said, ""Am I fat, please comment,"" then, if I chose to do so, fuck yes.

&gt;Would you walk up to them while they're eating a cheeseburger and tell them what they're doing wrong with their life?

No. But this analogy does not apply to this situation of someone posting something on reddit public space. Shit. That's the whole point of reddit. Is it supposed to be a big agreement-fest? No one comments on nothing at all? This is bizarre.

&gt;If someone is forcing their beliefs on you (politicians and unknown meddling fucktards), I'm all for taking a stand.

Me, too.

&gt;However, the redditors probably aren't doing that 

They are. People argue on everything here. Anyone who doesn't realize that needs to get educated real fast.

&gt;if you've paid enough attention in the religious subreddits, most of the redditors are for separation of church and state. They realize that forcing their beliefs on someone who doesn't believe the same is fucking idiotic.

Why do people get so butt-hurt when one intellectually violently disagrees on something like politics, but religion thinks it gets a free pass, and should never be commented on, even when they say something patently false? This happens on reddit all the time.

&gt;I'm sorry, but when I see your posts, the majority of the time I see arguments that are comparable to questions like ""OMG You don't believe in God? How could you not believe in God? You know you're going to Hell, right?""

Um, just go look at my last few posts. They are nothing like that.  I'm talking Kant, process theology, continental theology, Salk vaccine, or Watson/Crick,  Noyce, North-Whitehead.

I don't think that this compares to ""OMG You don't believe in God? How could you not believe in God? You know you're going to Hell, right?"":

12524,"When we get to watch the games live on TV (if we are lucky enough to have both TV providers broadcasting them) we have two different things happen:

Since I watch ESPN Amercia in the Netherlands on cable, I get all the commercials and studio talks from the horses mouth, figuratively. At the same time these are on, my friend in the UK gets a different experience: 

Since my friend watched last years playoffs on Channel 5 UK, channel 5 filtered over the commercial breaks with their own and their own half time show, this in my opinion is understandable for a commercial channel in the UK, but it was damn irritating for him. My friend gets to watch the actual Superbowl on the BBC though, which means it gets a similar treatment but I believe all commercials are cut completely since BBC1 is commercial-free. 

On a side note, Channel 5 couldn't afford to license the games after the playoffs so thats why we had to switch to watching together via makeshift DVDs. 

All in all we aren't too bothered by the commercial breaks. It gives us a chance to take a toilet break and talk a bit more casually about other things we have interests in (i.e gaming, zombies etc). 

Since we moved to watching DVD-based games the commercials and halftime shows are cut out completely in order to fit the games onto the DVD without too much downscaling to fit. More recently (as of this week) I've managed to help my friend get a USB stick solution which he downloads the games off of me directly so no more lossy DVD and postage costs :)

It simply increases the odds of hitting the other missile greatly and is well within our expertise and experience and technology right now.  ",worldnews

This account would have a special flair that would use some CSS tricks and hide upper comment. You could click on comment and see it. You should just reply to every rule breaker with this account.

Statistically the DTaP is one of the most dangerous vaccines on the market, in a leaked pharma memo, a pharmaceutical essentially admits that bad batches of this vaccine cause SIDS and then recommends to split the batches up so as you don't get a cluster of deaths in the same area which can easily be traced to the vaccine.  i.e. instead of fixing the vaccine, he was happy to continue sending out the dangerous vaccine as long as they don't be caught.

[Full Story - Proof that Big Pharma Doesn’t Care About Vaccine Harm ](http://gaia-health.com/conventional-medicine/pharmaceuticals/proof-big-pharma-doesnt-care-vaccine-harm/)

The so-called 'anti-vaccine' side gets misrepresented by the mainstream media, they are constantly setting up an 'anti-vaccine' strawman and then knocking it down with industry marketing and propaganda disguised as science.  

I've been involved in this for many years, going deep into the research and the debate, the major problems are that vaccines aren't being tested properly, nor is the schedule, unvaccinated people aren't being studied, vaccines are being studied one at a time, not using real controls in safety studies, not looking long-term.  In 2017 vaccines are a shot in the dark!

The only way to work out what's going on is to do the research for yourself, as the system and media has been setup by Big Pharma.  That means going to the independent experts, not Big Pharma vaccine patent holder (i.e. making millions from vaccines) 'experts' like Paul Offit who the mainstream media go to.  I've posted up presentations from the independent experts below, anyone who watches those all the way through will never vaccinate again.

Alternatively if you don't have time for the presentations below, here's an [award-winning documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU32Ojf8-rA) which allows a fair debate, rather than a one-sided strawman.  The media cannot be trusted, they have been compromised, and unfortunately vaccine science has also been compromised, as the doctors below will confirm for you.

The moment she is shot the gentle smile still lingers on her face, the hit man coldly try to keep her in place as they re load even fumbling with the shells. She heads out of the bedroom to hug her cat. This small gesture says a lot about the character. It instantly humanises her, giving her a maternal side, someone that appreciates life and is able to love. We begin to empathise with her, although we realise it's too late.

12775,"Yes, the entire human species does not pass on actual models of human beings nor the Universe to its children. Some attempt, but everyone would seem to have their limits when it comes to objectivity, and giving their child the fullest perspective. Of course, the ""lies of ommission"" here will be vast, but I'm sure we can find an explicit lie in almost every human being, and it must be almost because we can find silly cases like someone who doesn't communicate having a child because of rape or some such, and then ""that person doesn't tell lies"" and so on. My claim makes sense insofar as it applies to sensible people, but it's impossible to agree on a definition there. This is all if you want to get technical. I never know if people can just *see* these details or not.

And I can even make a technical definition, which says a correct definition. Here's what's actually going on:

Our environment is nothing more than ""configurations of matter subject to forces, which change the configurations of matter"". That's basically the simplest explanation of reality that I can give. Note that the environment includes human beings as well, so we are to be thought of as configurations of matter subject to forces as well. Then we have consciousness which somehow correlates with these configurations in what I conjecture is a ""1-to-1 correspondence or some other possibility that represents a definite mapping of matter to 'consciousness field'"", which is just a placeholder term for whatever consciousness is.

The point is to say that, if my arguments apply to the brain in terms of its ""matter configuration"", then they apply to consciousness somehow because of the matter-consciousness correspondence, correlation, dependence, or what-have-you.

Now, the only reason you ""understand"" what's going on in the environment, which includes models of the self, is because the patterns of the environment must somehow become ""maps"" or ""similar patterns"" or ""representations with 'sufficient' information"" in the mind. This means there are literally matter-to-matter maps from the environment to subset of that very environment, which is your mind.

I like Richard Feynman talking about ""matter jiggling around"". That's basically all there is - matter juggling around. And rather than there being nothing but chaos, the Universe has order, and we are part of this order, and we are a part of the order that reflects some of the order giving rise to the reflecting order in question. Just matter jiggling other matter is all this is, with consciousness ""along for the ride"" I conjecture.

Now parents pass on models to their children that do not reflect the actual order of things. The trivial thing to see is indoctrination. Are Nation States ""real""? They only exist as tribal mentality and facilitate conflict. That's why we have ""the pledge of allegiance"" and ""flags"" and so on. Are children told that being raised this way is the same as being raised in a small warring tribe at war with the small tribe across the river? It is - it's the exact same thing, only the necessity of war isn't apparent in such sheltered first-world environments, so the indoctrination is necessary, since ""the enemy"" can't be seen first hand.

This is how the human ape programs itself. It lies. It's also suicidal. And it's suicidal to program your child with anything but global citizen mentality, but then show how the world currently resists it. That's the only sensible thing for the human species to do. But it's impossible for this to happen. So what must the human species be doing in it's place? Lying.

But the real point is that we can consider the sum total knowledge we have in human minds and computers as to how the world actually works. And we can compare this entire bank of information, how it's networked together, and how information flows through and alters the nodes, how the network changes, and so on. We can consider our ""total mind"" and consider how well it reflects reality.

The answer is terribly, and the evidence is the state the world is in right now, and I don't want to write the list of examples, because it's lengthy, but climate change and ocean acidification are the big ones, and my main concerns are food shortages from extreme whether, water scarcity, and mass migration over the century. I can't see how this can lead to anything other than world war. Growing antibiotic resistance in the context of rapidly changing disease doesn't have me thrilled either.

So why are we maintaining this suicide machine? It can only be through lies. ",worldnews

Uhh yeah, no.  A simple look at the stats should be enough to tell you it isn't a subset.  Hell, they don't even draw from the same dataset, and you probably shouldn't go around talking shit on people's understanding of stats if you don't know that.  Besides from the fact they have completely different weighting, PER draws from a *subset dataset* of BPM (BPM has minute adjustments and opponent performance adjustments), while BPM makes a metric fuckton of additional estimations by drawing from advanced stats.  Does adding more stats make BPM a better stat?  No, of course not.  I can run a regression on what the player ate for breakfast a day ago, two days ago, three, etc. and add arbitrary values to food items and see what sticks.

I know this is a poorly received opinion, but casual players were promised No Limits would stick around when they decided to change QP. I didn't believe it then so I wasn't surprised when it went away, but it isn't right nor is it fair that the game a lot of us bought originally doesn't exist outside of the whims of the developers or Custom Games.

Edit: Despite how I started this comment, there is no hostility towards the OP at all, just disappointment with how the game has evolved.

I wish you guys would remember that competitive is only a small part of the game and that the casual scene suffering affects us all. Your downvotes don't bother me, but the idea that the downvotes are coming from a place of disdain for casual players or casual game modes is discouraging. QP should've stayed how it was and a different mode should've been made for Competitive Practice. Everyone would've won that way, but that isn't what happened. I still hope that it will be that way one day soon and, although misguided as it may be, I hope that the community will be less hostile towards each other as a result.

A lot of the trolls in games come from the displacement that occurred with the changes early on in the game's life. People who played for fun could no longer do so until Custom Games came about and, even then, it was largely just a Band-Aid for what many people originally loved about QP.

Unilateral decisions like the one of the German chancellor Merkel who welcomed all refugees without limits, or closing the borders by some countries only exacerbated the crisis. It's partly due to the fact that EU hasn't had worked out solutions for such a problem. 

Poland on it's own should show solidarity and declare willingness to take in refugees. I don't demand the Polish government to actually force people to come and stay here, but to recognize the problem and openly offer to help these people. And to cooperate with the EU on this issue.

The land of Dravos has been torn apart by civil war. Four factions, each led by a powerful female warlord, vie for total domination. However, none have managed to gain an advantage over the other for many years, and the war it seems will never end.

From parts unknown come two very different travelers, both masters of mystical martial arts. One is Zen-Xing, a pacifist monk who is drawn to Dravos by a spiritual calling to bring peace. Finding himself in the court of the battle-hungry Lexivus, Zen-Xing begins the long road to taming her from her bloodlust. The other arrival is his brother Khan Korsav, a cunning and ruthless warlock who has been hired by the warlord Averion to train her younger sister, the meek and compassionate Tarabeth, to be a capable warrior and successor to her clan.",anime

- terrible roads, or infrastructure in general. Gov. blames the topography and the climate. But it's really just very bad planning, decades of neglect in maintenance. And they always make terrible compromises when building new roads. This is especially bad if you consider that we pay 100-300% in taxes on new cars.

- People are kind of introvert, which is bad for me as an introvert myself, difficult to meet new people and make friends. Even after years living here i still find it easier to get to know people in my old home country. 

- The way refugees are treated by our UDI. I don't see why children who where born and grew up here, speak perfect Norwegian, who's parents where almost still children when the came here should be send to exile, to a country that is completely foreign to them, because their grandparents made a mistake when filling out some forms over 20 years ago.

&gt; Louis William Tomlinson, born 24 December 1991, is from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England and is a member of English-Irish four-piece boyband One Direction. Tomlinson first started performing as a sixth form student in his school's musical productions. He starred as Danny Zuko in an adaptation of the Grease musical. In 2010 he auditioned as a solo artist for the British TV show The X Factor. He got accepted to  boot camp, but failed to advance further. He was then one of the five eliminated solo singers that were to form a boyband, as decided by the judges, and continue the competition in the bands category. He, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and former member Zayn Malik formed One Direction and together finished third in the competition. Simon Cowell of The X Factor did not hesitate to sign them to his label SYCO. Tomlinson and his bandmates’ first single release “What Makes You Beautiful” made it straight to number 1 in the Irish and UK charts. Read more on Last.fm.

13127,"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police say ...

Six Nations has their own Native police service, funded by the province and the feds. Can someone explain why taxpayers are paying for redundant police services? 

I see this every time there's a **real** crime on a rez. The newspapers will always report that the Native police service attended the scene ""accompanied by OPP"".

There are 9 Native police services in Ontario alone. And they are accountable to no one.

And can someone explain what the criteria is for OPP entering a reserve, or do they just make this shit up on the fly? Stolen vehicles? Not our problem. Missing Native? We're on it.

""Jordan drove around a while and couldn’t see any OPP, so Ms. Munroe called the dispatch. She “was told that the officers did not enter the reserve as it was too dangerous.”

Conservative political strategists and the GOP leadership, who know that they can point to illegal immigrants in order rile up support from voters such as yourself who are tangibly harmed by their policies.

&gt;My first ever job, back when I was 19 and trying to pay for college was lost because the owner of a chicken processing plant dumped me and about 40 other guys and replaced us with illegals. I was actively hurt by immigration. My father has been massively hurt as someone in landscaping. You can't even get a landscaping job now for even decent money in most places because it's overrun with illegals who are paid straight cash under the table.

I get it, and for the record no one is arguing that illegal immigration is completely free of negative effects like the one you outlined, just that the far more effective way of managing those problems is by punishing business owners like the ones who fired you for hiring illegal immigrants. I totally understand that it feels viscerally satisfying to see illegal immigrants being aggressively prosecuted, everyone can grasp that emotional draw, but *what about the businesses who hire them*? Is it not far more efficient to monitor those businesses than millions of disparate people living off the grid? Wouldn't it make more financial sense to find those companies, fine them, and punish those *american citizens who are breaking our laws* than to spend billions building a wall? 

And, to tie that into the first question you asked, who do you think the owner of that chicken farm donates to? Which political party do they support? Who do you think the GOP listens to, the chicken farmer who has scratch to donate or the broke, displaced workers? 

&gt;Im voting in my own self interest and the interest of those I love. You keep voting how the big wigs in NYC and LA tell you to though. They love that cheap labor and driving down your salary. I have a lot of friends who are democrats, but it is sad to see how you all vote to stifle and suppress your own wages.

This is just factually incorrect, and a perfect example of conservative interests pushing a bullshit narrative that you're too eager to believe. There is only one party which is pushing for worker protections, a livable wage, decreasing the wage gap, and that's backed up by their voting record. The last Senate vote on increasing the minimum wage? [All but one Republican senator voted against it whereas all but one Dem voted for it.](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/113/senate/2/117). 

Name a single workers rights issue that is important to you, and I can guarantee the GOP has either voted against it or passed legislation limiting it.

Objectively, this is a non-issue. Speaking from publishing experience, ANN did the bare minimum and retracted the insensitive bit, and they actually didn't have to since this was a review, which is usually taken as an opinion column. Although if it's their own staff doing the review, they have to stand behind his/her perspective even though it isn't the entire editorial board's opinion (unless it's an editorial), so that's probably a factor as well.

That said, I'm fairly sure if no one died they would never have bothered with getting rid of the snark in the first place. Kinda hints that it may be time to review quality standards on what gets published.

Lol, please do not compare guerrilla warfare insurgencies where the militants hide in civilian clothing to a proper war. 

And to answer your question. Gulf War.


&gt;You can actually argue that the USs involvement in wars in the Middle East is what led to modern terrorism and the creation of ISIS.
The Iranian revolution from the 70s, that led to the creation of Islamist extremist states, was sponsored and supported by the US.

13385,"The studies that attempt to show that rape is a vastly underreported crime often rely on bullshit, or are very old.  For instance, the [1 in 4 college women are raped guilt trip](http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html).  *""she doesn't think she was raped, but we say it was rape""* Words mean things.  Rape is unwanted sex through gained through force or serious threats.  Some feminists attempt to define rape as essentially sex which makes a women feel bad.  But that doesn't make it rape.

So, honestly, fuck off with the guilt trip stats stuff.  If you rape someone and hurt them, you'll go to jail.  ""Men"" are not rapists.  Those who choose to rape are rapists, and there are penalties.

As for underreported things, lets talk about prison rape.  I've seen some studies that show that when you account for prison rape, the per capita stats for rape equalize.  It's not just a woman's concern.

Also, fuck off with the *only so recently, women had it soooo bad!*.  So did men -- they died in terrible working conditions, wars, and other crappy situations trying to defend and provide for those women.  Male and female feminists everywhere are fond of holding up the *rich, executive white guy* as somehow being the good comparison to show how bad women had it.  

It's a big social movement focusing on a non-problem, because it's an issue that is *already being dealt with*.

The only reason more people don't say what I'm saying in polite company is because socially (and perhaps instinctually) we see upsetting women as being a bad idea.  That's why society puts up with stupid things like the Slut Walk.  Immature, dumb faux-activism which probably has a lot to do with it being a socially acceptable way for unattractive or sex-nervous women to try and objectify themselves *because objectification is part of sex for everyone!*  Even if you don't want to think of it that way.

13395,"Depends on what ships they got from Dorne and from Highgarden. I'd assume a larger warship with possible multiple decks you could potentially fit that many horses on a ship. I'm pretty sure that when Varys showed up in Dorne, part of what we didn't see was explaining to them specifically what Dany needed. He had the measure of the ships that were already available to her, and I'm sure at some point his little birds told him about Theon and Yara popping up and joining forces too. The biggest roadblock for Dany at that point was having ships that could accommodate horses. I think between Highgarden and Dorne, Highgarden had the trees that could be felled to make the larger ships to carry horses.

Of course when I rewatched the last scene of Season 6, episode 10 it looks like they just accommodated the horses by doing a slight modification in the holds of a standard ship. Looks like the holds are basically open, with some cross beams going across the opening so you can sort of balance across and walk from one side of the deck to the other instead of going around the open holds. I was thinking they'd pack them into a larger ship like the Spanish did when they'd transport ponies and horses over to the Americas (and probably what they were thinking with their calculations) but the Dothraki revere and respect their horses much more than the Conquistadors did so of course, they'd not pack them in really tight and also give them access to fresh air.

He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.

&gt;The global system, TAMI, can hone in on a compatible mind and instantly be able to manipulate it to some varying degree dependent upon many factors. The offense practices their trade by influencing people near a targeted individual to convey information only pertinent to them, for spy games. These people are everyday citizens unfamiliar with this high technology. The effects are so subtle without lots of training to detect, nobody would be the wiser. They would at most just question why they did that or felt the need to say that.

13471,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I'm on your side in this though. If you give something to someone it's reasonable to assume, unless explicitly told, they're going to share it, or at the very least just not protect it to your standards. Having a contract you signed stating I will loan you this chair under the agreement you won't share it is one thing, just giving you a chair with no verbal or written agreement over what you're allowed to do with it is another. Should these boys know better? yeah. Does it mean they were being malicious? no, I doubt the thought ever crossed their minds about intentionally causing harm to someone. They negligent at worst.

The rankings were removing positional bias (as much as possible), and the fact is that, yes, 5 other players in the entire league played their position at a similar level to Tom Brady, and weren't suspended for 4 games. Any advantage that the QB position should give Brady is at least negated by his shortened season.

You can't understand the world today (world news) without understanding the history. If the Germans don't want nukes on their soil they first have to cancel NATO treaties like nuclear sharing. Currently the US would provide Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey with nuclear weapons in case of a war. The treaty was signed so those countries don't need to develop their own nuclear weapon capabilities but still felt safe against a Soviet attack. Yes, it's probably unnecessary today. But it's not like its up to the US to simply withdraw their nukes. If the Germans don't want the nukes their politicians have to get active first.",worldnews

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/aa0a3d88689e4e6dad01e1ba71449658.png)  

&gt; Sabaton is a symphonic power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts. In April 2012, four members left the band and formed another, whilst vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members.

&gt; Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.

&gt; In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.

&gt; The band returned for a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.

&gt; Their third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like ""Back in Control"" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), ""Attero Dominatus"" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and ""Angels Calling"" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.

&gt; In March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song ""Birds of War"".

&gt; As a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles ""Cliffs of Gallipoli"" and ""Ghost Division"".

&gt; In September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.

&gt; The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War ""White Death"". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.

&gt; On March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found, Sabaton used digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.

&gt; Following the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage, ""Carolus Rex,"" the first single for the album of the same name (Carolus Rex), was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world tour headlined as ""The Swedish Empire Tour"". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.

&gt; ""Carolus Rex"" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album was made available in both Swedish and English versions.

&gt; Regarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented: ""It appears to be sudden, but it had actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...""

&gt; The former members of Sabaton have since formed a new band called ""Civil War"", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.

&gt; In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. With Snowy Shaw replacing him as touring drummer.

&gt; In November 2013, it was announced that Sabaton would be touring North America with Iced Earth for six weeks in the spring of 2014. Robban Bäck has also left the band and been replaced with Hannes van Dahl of Evergrey.

&gt; In January 2014, the band announced the cover of their new album called ""Heroes,"" due to be released on May 16 2014. The album proved to be a hit and made #1 on the official Swedish album chart. On 27 January the band was announced to play Download Festival in June.

&gt; Thobbe Englund left Sabaton as guitarist with release of their new album ""The Last Stand"" on 19th August 2016 to ""expand his own creativeness in combination with a somewhat stiller life, where he will not tour all year round at the speed of light"" as he said himself.

According to a USAID spokesman,&amp;quot;the 170 breakthrough innovations&amp;quot; funded by DIV &amp;quot;have reached 13 million people in poverty and resulted in $5 in additional funding from outside investors for every tax dollar spend.

Nope, he didn't cheat. The mechanic of restriction and vow is explained quite thoroughly, and he doesn't get a free pass. Even so, Kurapika becoming the 'hunter' of the Spiders allows us to see the human side of the Spiders: how they really feel about their boss and the team, how they react to being hunted, etc. We wouldn't have gotten that without Kurapika being the aggressor.

Plus, Togashi didn't take the easy route out and have Kurapika slaughter all of the Spiders. He only killed Uvogin, which allows for us to see how the Spiders react. We also see how strong the Spiders are against everyone other than Kurapika, and they are anything but pushovers. Watch the Chrollo vs Zoldycks fight again.

While the Conclave does choose the Seneschal, they do so by drawing lots. However, the current Seneschal, Archmaester Theobald, volunteered after the senile Archmaester Walgrave was chosen.

&gt;Grand Maester Pycelle

Part of the reason Pycelle has been Grand Maester for so long is that about half a dozen Grand Maesters died in as many years immediately before his appointment, the last dying of a cold before reaching King's Landing. The Conclave then chose an unusually young Pycelle to try to prevent another quick appointment.

I understand your point about the implementation of such a system being 'easier' in Norway, or rather, any country that isn't the United States.


In that the United States holds 25% of the world's prison population, while being 5% of the worlds total population. And it would be extremely difficult for *any* country in the world to implement under those conditions.


I understand your acknowledgement of the complexity of the issues in the US prison system, specifically in the question of 'who' and 'how.'


Then I responded to the question you didn't acknowledge; 'why?'

Why does the country that thinks it's number one in freedom have such an astoundingly huge skew of prison population. In my mind at least, those two concepts can't exist side by side. What could these people possibly have done to deserve that?

I find the United States attitude towards incarceration very scary. Prison isn't a healthy place to be, nor is it an easy place to come out of, and integrate into society again. It can cause long term damage to a persons psyche and mental health. A negative effect that will be with that person for the rest of their lives, and the lives of people around them.

&gt; The reality is the world is moving closer together as such the need to work together and pool in sovereignty through international agreements becomes more important.

The world can work together without being ruled by a foreign court or having a foreign law supersede your own law.

&gt; Even countries like China and Japan aren't authorities to themselves.

Japan's foreign diplomacy is largely dictated to by the Americans, but China is an independent nation and no other nation can tell China how to govern her people.

&gt; Also the ECSC/EEC/EU was always a political project, whose membership was approved by the legal process of the United Kingdom. The EEC was completely honest about this at the time, if you are going to blame anyone, blame British politicians at the time for it.

It was always a political project, but the British people were promised they would retain their sovereignty and right to self-governance. Needless to say we were lied to.

&gt; ""There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty"" - Edward Heath, Government White Paper, July 1971. 

&gt; I fail to understand why having as much sovereignty as possible is a good thing. It seems to be a way for dictates to abuse their people.

Because I want Britain to be ruled by British people who live in Britain and are impacted by our laws, not a foreign court. Britain is Britain. Europe is Europe. If you prefer to be ruled by a German-ruled court, then so be it, but I'd prefer to maintain our independence.

13780,"&gt;Surely you can agree that we're likely to be our own undoing?

How so? 

We were likely to be our own undoing according to Erhlich in his ""Population Bomb"". He is famous for having been wrong about every single prediction he ever made. And not in a small way.

During that period, almost all ways of measuring human existence have improved. 

Doomsday predictions have existed since crops experienced rain during harvest and a guy blamed it on another guy who had a wife that was too hot. They have never come true. Killing the guy and fucking his wife did nothing to improve the likelihood that rain wouldn't fall during the next harvest.

If you want to have a discussion on a conspiracy sub about our march towards human degradation, perhaps you may want to discuss people like the Rockefeller and their affiliated groups who all push their hundred trillion dollar climate change scheme and how people could instead be empowered to determine their destiny instead of being lead by power obsessed psychopaths.

Sometimes during really bad days, we would have an employee sit up there to separate the film with cotton-gloved fingers as it rolled off the reel. So many times where it dumped on the floor, tangled, melted or caused headaches for everyone.

To visualize how much of a tide turner that siege was, just two years after the siege, Roman armies were marching into Armenia and their navies are reported as raiding cities in the Levant and even Egypt.

Well if you want to that, then you should get rid of the institution of marriage and the nuclear family since typically it is family members who rape and molest children, mostly and often. 

Also there are a lot of broken people out there who have never received help for the trauma the live and deal with on a daily basis. Because our culture rarely gives a fuck about victims, and on certain level, blames people for their abuse or dismisses their claims outright. You see this repeatedly on reddit. 

Frankly, this isn't a question of supply and demand which is what you're trying to make it about. It is about a persistent and overweening rape culture that has more sympathy for rapists and would be rapists than victims. It is a culture you choose to participate in if you ever watch porn, go to strip club, or pay for prostitution.

Many of the victims of childhood sexual abuse in up as so-called ""sex workers"" because any semblance of having a normal life has been taken from them. Mainly because the PTSD from sexual abuse is hard to handle and recover from (that comes from my own experience by the way).

Just remember, when you get a lap dance, there is a significant probability that the woman doing so was at some point sexually assaulted as child. And your pleasure in the moment is a direct consequence of that past. You are complicit in the culture of abuse that creates ""disposable"" humans that are used up for the short-term pleasures of other human beings (typically men).

Again I am dude and was born a dude. Someone with pedo urges that claims they can't control is full of shit. If that is so true and so real, then they should castrate themselves, go live in the mountains, go be a deep sea fishermen, or actively make a plan to not ever be around children. It's not hard to do. It's only hard for them because they think it is everyone else's responsibility to help them, which is the typical abuser's mentality.  ",conspiracy

13974,"&gt; Our country would be taken over immediately if everyone just grew gardens and hung out with each other and we didn't have soldiers. 

Your statement is logically false.  There would be circumstances that would have to be necessary for a country that didn't have a standing army to be vulnerable to an organized on-scale attack against itself.  Such as having an opponent who had that capacity and a willing populace.  And having no internal checks against external/internal exploitation.  And having no ability to raise an army.  There's a whole list of criteria that would have to be met.  

Also, the question of having capacity is completely different from the question of using it externally against somebody else for no good reason.  Which is the current situation with the US.

And what good has it done for you, having this army?  Do you think you are safer now?  Do you think you are more secure?  I don't think any of that is true.  I think you're worse off than before all the needless war started.    

There are Nash equilibriums that exist where countries can live together non-violently.  There are ways to manifest that equilibrium.  We're just not doing them.  And the reality of the existence of such a balance is found anywhere you have large groups of people who don't engage in conflict with each other.  When was the last time Chicago invaded Texas?

The problem is that a lot of his points are poorly internally reconciled. Some of them are fine.

That 'Curse of Cassandra' (seeing what will happen, but being helpless to change it) aspect is one of the hardest parts about parenting.

That being said: Progress isn't a religion. A religion has at its core a ""transcendental ethic"", a rule that is more important to follow (for believers) than the rule of normal ethics, such as protecting the rights of others, for the purposes of a ""transcendental reward"". This is why the religious feel comfortable firebombing planned parenthood clinics, for example. Progress, broadly defined, is the state of moving society as a *whole* to a state where mundane ethics, not transcendental ethics, are more respected.

The ""pussy and money"" thing is vacuous. First of all, money isn't an end in itself. People USE money for things, mostly, the satisfaction of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. *Those* are ends. But, this means that if there were an alternate means to satisfy them other than money, than it would no longer be part of this faulty duality.

Extreme ideologies are religions... sure.
