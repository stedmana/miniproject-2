You have it too, given your claim that immigration improves GDP. The neutral claim in this case would be that immigration doesn't affect GDP growth.

&gt;Why do you keep repeating this nonsense?

Because it isn't. Learn some economics. Asia went from being just Australia and New Zealand's fledgling economies to a powerful economic region on par with Europe. It would be absolutely retarded to not want to tap into it. To do so you need to be able to trade in that Ocean, and Vancouver is the best town to do so.

&gt;From where in Canada was the vast majority of the population of the city going to come from?

Well, let's see... anywhere where they felt the advantages of moving to a large growing town outweighed staying where they are. Internal migration does occur, it's not like people literally never move once their family lives in an area.

&gt;Do you have evidence that large percentage of the population of the city is directly involved in primary or even secondary import and export activities?

http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/employment-labour/labour-market-statistics

&gt;Does it seem odd to you that every other major port on the north American Pacific coast has a massive immigrant population?

Such towns do, because they're easily accessible and have a large number of low skill and high paying jobs for them to work because of the shipping yards, so there's incentive to stay there or move there once they arrive. Yeah, that pre-existing business sure does draw in people...

&gt;Assertion isn't a substitute for good reasoning.

True, which is why I've linked evidence and posted conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence.

&gt;Why stop at Vancouver? Why allow any immigration after confederation?

I never said all immigration was bad, just excessive immigration. The dose makes the poison, don't you know. We need a small amount of iron in our diet to make red blood cells, but too much can make us ill or even kill us. In case you aren't catching on, this is a metaphor for immigration using a real world example. In small numbers, targeting qualified individuals we don't have currently in the country as a stop gap measure while we train our own is a good way of doing immigration.",canada

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/1905e40de5ae4d80b37a4ed66f234818.png)  

&gt; Amos Lee (born 1978 as Ryan Anthony Massaro) is an American singer-songwriter whose musical style encompasses folk, rock and soul. His self-titled debut album is full of folk and soul, with a jazz twist.  The Flower Songfacts state that his fourth album, Mission Bell, which was released on January 25, 2011 debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 40,000 copies sold in its first week; these sales were the lowest for a #1 debut in the Nielsen SoundScan era.

&gt; Lee grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA. He has been quoted as saying that he is fortunate to have seen different sides of life in America. Lee enrolled at the University of South Carolina in 1995. He began to play guitar and write songs seriously while he studied English. After graduating with an English degree, Lee moved back to Philadelphia to teach elementary school. He later made the tough decision to stop teaching in order to pursue a career in music. Shortly thereafter, he released a self-produced EP that featured five of his original songs, which did extremely well in Philadelphia and created a buzz. Norah Jones was the person who finally gave Lee his big breakthrough when she asked him to open for her 2004 tour. Lee then went on to produce his self-titled debut album. In March and April of 2005 Lee opened for the tour that Merle Haggard and Bob Dylan were both embarking on, all 3 performers were extremely well received by critics as the tour went by, with Dylan receiving some of his strongest reviews in years. On October 3, 2006, Lee released his second album, ""Supply &amp; Demand"" to critical and commercial acclaim.

&gt; At the age of only 27, Amos Lee has enjoyed notable success with his debut album and looks to have a promising future in the music business. His favorite artists and sources of inspiration include Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, John Prine, Bill Withers, and James Taylor. Read more on Last.fm.

They also needed a lot of luck with the few truly dangerous chances that spain created and pollersbeck (the discovery of the torunament imo) managed to perfectly stay on his toes despite not even having to save anything for the vast majority of the game because the german defenders blocked a ridiculous amount of shots.

But all that wouldn't have been enough if Spain fully found their way into the game. Instead, they were shifting their momentum a lot (being passive for 25 minutes, pressing for 15 minutes) to confuse our defence when it really just made it harder for them to get into their flow.

And even with all that accounted for; Kimmich's header was anything but a 100% chance and if that one missed and it ended 0-0 at the 90th minute I just cannot imagine how the german team could possibly hold the same amount of intensity for another 30 minutes.

158,"&gt;The American population DOES have access to each of the things you just listed. They're not widely owned because they're prohibitively expensive to purchase and maintain.

Yes and no. You can definitely buy heavier firepower, and you can even buy old tanks, fighter jets, etc. but not only are most of the current models absolutely inaccessible to civilians, we also lack the infrastructure and materials to maintain and supply them in any kind of extended combat setting. I guess really my point is just that it's odd to hear people argue that they need these guns to defend themselves against the government when those guns wouldn't even begin to prepare them for a plausible defense against the military. At this point, it might not even be enough to fend off the police force. It just seems like asking for a pocket knife in case a rhino attacks you. Sure, by all means take the knife, but if you're genuinely concerned about preparing for a rhino attack, it doesn't seem like a pocket knife will really make that much of a difference.

&gt;Secondly, very few 2A advocates call for the ""distribution"" of these items to the general populace; they merely advocate for access to these items for those who wish to possess them.

You're absolutely right. I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

I completely agree on your last point too. If there was any kind of civil war like that I highly doubt 100% of the military would come down on one side of the issue, so who knows which factions would have which chunks of military and public support. ",conspiracy

That's not ignoring the fact that there are people out there that think muslim immigrants are playing ""the long game"".

Spotify is actually backed (and partly owned/funded) by the major record companies. It's easily the biggest database of of music available for streaming, and it does so in 384 kbps Ogg Vorbis, which is pretty fucking close to FLAC/WAV/AIFF.

Furthermore, the application itself is clean, easy, intuitive and fast. It's one of the best applications released in the last few years. It does exactly what it's supposed to, it never crashes (I actually haven't had it crash on me once, and I've had it since early beta), it's fast, no bloat, and additions are always small and welcome.

Grooveshark isn't really comparable (in my opinion). It's not even in the ballpark. The selection is rubbish, and it's mostly uploaded in horrible quality by people without spelling abilities whatsoever. Spotify is high bitrate Ogg Vorbis all around, and it's uploaded by the actual content providers, which means it's usually 100% correct. When a new album is released, it's usually already on Spotify. In near CD quality.

Also, as others noted (and I mentioned in brief), Spotify is a project backed by the industry. The artists get money out of it (however small the sum). Right now there are issues (because of the transition from the free model to the payment model), artists aren't paid enough, but in the future, this will be the officially (or one of the officially) backed service(s); and it will be a legitimate way for artists to make real money.",Music

examples of strategies used by some European countries, the Green Party of Canada has come to the
conclusion that it is time to legalize the adult use of marijuana. Furthermore, the Greens believe that drug
addictions should be treated as a health problem, not as criminal offences.
Green Party MPs will:
• Legalize marijuana by removing marijuana from the drug schedule.
• Create a regulatory framework for the safe production of marijuana by small,
independent growers.
• Develop a taxation rate for marijuana similar to that of tobacco.

&gt; Village People is a Disco band that formed New York City, New York, United States in 1977. The group is well known for their outrageous on-stage costumes (the members dressing up as a police officer, an American Indian chief, a construction worker, a soldier, a leatherman (biker) and a cowboy) as for their catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics.

&gt; The band was assembled in 1977 and managed by two French musicians, Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, specifically to showcase and perform their disco music creations. Much like Frank Farian's Boney M. or Spice Girls, the group was manufactured. Despite the French song writers, the songs were all in English.

&gt; The band's name references a well-known gay area of New York City, Greenwich Village. Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo got the inspiration for creating an assembly of American man archetypes based on the gay men of the Village who frequently dressed in various fantasy ways. The police officer character is said to have been inspired by an actual Sacramento County (California) Sheriff's Deputy - David Orth.

&gt; The United States Navy considered using the Village People hit ""In the Navy"" in a recruiting advertising campaign on television and radio. They contacted Belolo, who decided to give the rights for free on the condition that the Navy help them shoot the music video. Less than a month later, Village People arrived at the San Diego Naval base. The Navy provided them with a war ship, several airplanes, and hundreds of Navy men. When the video started showing and the Navy started the planned ad campaign, some newspapers protested using taxpayer money to fund music videos (especially for a group considered by some to be ""morally dubious""). The Navy quickly cancelled the campaign. The scandal tremendously boosted the popularity of the song.

&gt; Other hits include their trademark ""Macho Man"", ""Go West"", and ""YMCA"". More than twenty years later, a dance that involves forming the latter four letters with the dancer's arms and legs is still popular at summer camps, office functions, wedding receptions, school dances, sporting events and B'nai Mitzvahs. In the middle of the seventh inning of each baseball game at Yankee Stadium, the grounds crew take an on-field break from grooming the infield to dance as ""YMCA"" is played, typically to enthusiastic cheers from the fans.

&gt; An interesting fact about the Village People recordings is that all of the background vocals for their best known recordings where provided by 2 session musicians who went on to front notable bands; Bill Champlin from Chicago, and Richard Page (musician) from Mr. Mister.

&gt; The group also appeared in their 1980 feature film Can't Stop the Music, directed by Nancy Walker, written by Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, music and lyrics by Jacques Morali and starring Steve Guttenberg, Valerie Perrine, Bruce Jenner, and Village People. The movie ""won"" the Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay prizes at the 1980 Golden Raspberry Awards in March 1981 and was nominated in almost all the other categories.

&gt; In 1981, with the popularity of disco waning and New Wave music on the rise, Village People replaced their on-stage costumes with a new look inspired by the New Romantic movement, and released the New Wave album Renaissance; it was not a commercial success.Victor Willis returned to the group briefly in late 1981 for the album Fox on the Box, which was released in 1982 only in Europe but did have limited release in the United States in 1983 under the title In the Street. Miles Jaye had briefly taken over for Ray Simpson as lead singer by 1983 and contributed an extra track to In the Street. Mark Lee replaced David Hodo in 1982.

&gt; Their last album containing new material, the 1985 dance/Hi-NRG release Sex Over the Phone, was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than their Renaissance album. The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the BBC because of its content - credit card dirty phone calls. The Sex album featured yet another new lead singer, Ray Stephens (of The Great Space Coaster fame). Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985.

&gt; In 1985, the group took a hiatus but reunited in 1987 with the line-up of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley and Ray Simpson.

&gt; Since 1988, the group has managed itself under the name Sixuvus Ltd.

&gt; In 1994, the Village People joined the German national soccer team to sing its official World Cup '94 theme, ""Far Away in America.""

&gt; Starting in 2004, Village People performed as the opening act for Cher in her Farewell Tour until it ended in April 2005.

&gt; From July 18th to July 20th, 2004, Village People performed in Berlin for three shows as an opening act for the German punk band Die Ärzte.
On May 8, 2012, Victor Willis wins a landmark ruling in the first case heard regarding the Copyright Act of 1976 which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing rights initially granted to record companies and publishers after 35 years.

&gt; In April 2013, Village People recorded ""Let's Go Back To The Dance Floor"" -- a song written by Harry Wayne Casey (KC &amp; The Sunshine Band) and produced by DJ Julian Marsh.   Read more on Last.fm.

491,"Some of the more ""Japanese"" shows honestly feel like completely different shows between English and Japanese. 

Because of my learning process, I actually don't know what its like to watch anime as a learner, I only have the experience of watching it with almost no Japanese experience and watching it as a fluent speaker. 

I'm digging through my MAL now to see if there's anything that stands out.

1) Evangelion. Shinji's character and relationship with his father are much closer to home for a lot of Japanese families. Also, a lot of the lines have double meanings (I think most people remember the double meaning when Asuka says ""I feel sick"" at the end, but that line has like 4-5 possible interpretations in Japanese, ranging from ""I feel like I'm going to vomit"" to ""You're a piece of shit, Shinji.""

2) FLCL: Again, this plays really heavily on Japanese family dynamics. Also the show sounds really dirty when you watch it with your eyes closed (intentionally, of course). That can't really carry over into the subtitles and the dub tries, but only captures some of it. 

3) Azumanga Daioh: Osaka's character (and Osakan characters in general) make way more sense when you're familiar with the dialect. A lot of the puns as well just don't carry over. Fortunately since it trends towards the absurd, the physical humor stays the same. One bit I remember in particular is the mamechishiki bit, where Osaka (iirc) is sharing mamechishiki, which in Japanese is like little weird facts (this is where mameshiba comes from), but instead keeps sharing facts about beans, which can be read as mame no chishiki. I think the subtitles make it ""grains of truth"" versus ""truth about grains"" but it's not nearly as funny because it doesn't feel as natural.

4) Samurai Champloo. I think Jin's Japanese VA plays the character better, but the English Mugen is waaaay better. With a bit of a background in Okinawa you start to see why that's the case, since Mugen is supposed to be from Okinawa. There's also the whole bit about Mugen learning to write that makes much more sense in the Japanese (Mugen writes a sideways eight on the building, mugen means ""infinite."")

If you get placed in &gt;gold 4 than you should watching videos about economy, nades, holding angles, the a little bit more advanced things as it seems you got the basics.

From there you can start practicing your AIM, but not the hardcore way, just a little bit of DM here and there but mainly stick to Matchmaking as for lower ranks this is IMO the best way to improve.

&gt; Jason Desrouleaux (born September 21, 1989 in Miami, Florida, United States), known more simply as Jason Derülo, is a Haitian-American singer-songwriter, dancer, choreographer, producer and actor signed to JR Rotem’s label Beluga Heights. He has been writing hit singles for acts such as Lil Wayne, Pleasure P, Pitbull, Stat Quo, Iyaz and Birdman since 2007, and he released his eponymous self-titled debut album in March 2010. His debut single from the album, ""Whatcha Say"", was released to radio in June 2009, it sampled the Imogen Heap song ""Hide and Seek"" and became a huge digital hit, selling over 2 million records, gaining an RIAA certification of 2x platinum, and reaching #1 in the US and several other countries. The album also spawned two further US top ten singles including ""In My Head"", which peaked at #5, and ""Ridin' Solo"", which peaked at #9.

&gt; In 2011, he announced the release of his sophomore album, 'Future History'. ""Don't Wanna Go Home"" was released as the album's lead single in May 2011. As reported by the Undefeated Songfacts, on January 6, 2012, while Derülo was rehearsing for his Future History Tour, he broke one of his neck vertebrae. When he debuted ""Undefeated"" during the May 22, 2012 finale of the TV show 'American Idol', it was the singer’s first post-neck injury television performance. Read more on Last.fm.

606,"Sure, I know it's someone's job, and I also know that the lore is absolutely, 100% secondary to things that actually exist in the game. It's why there can be two Tracers in a game. It's why enemies in the lore save each other in-game, and allies kill each other. It *doesn't matter*. It's just officially-sanctioned fanfic. It's backstory for the people, like you presumably, who should really be reading a book instead.

The ""style and atmosphere"" has *way* more to do with the in-game art design and how well everything is animated than some auxiliary comics Blizzard has released. The personality and interactions between the characters are nice, I'll give you that, but nothing that actually becomes part of the experience you have while playing the game should be *subservient* to the lore. They're making it up as they go, it does not dictate the direction of the game. Want Doomfist to be voiced by Terry Crews? Keep literally all the lore the same and add a sentence at the end that says ""Also he's kind of wacky"". Bam. Done.

I think it's fine, he sounds pretty good. It's kind of a letdown. Maybe it would have worn thin after a while. I'd love if there was some event where he had different voicelines, you could even say it's set in the past before some traumatic event made him much more serious to satiate the people perturbed by the lack of continuity in the arcs of characters who capture the same point tens of thousands of times a night. Or a legendary skin with some rare voice lines. Whatever.

But, yeah, the takeaway is that lore is bullshit, and they could have made it what they needed it to be to fit whatever personality Doomfist ended up being by editing a paragraph for about five minutes. This is not a story-based game. It's fun backstory for people who care but it should never dictate what can and can't happen, it will always be a tertiary concern, if that.",Overwatch

Plus concern for new government regulations on fuel costs, that all impacts the price of gasoline. His budget proposal last month cut 46.2 billion on subsidies to the fuel industry in the next decade to stimulate investment in alternative energy sources. There are other factors that have caused the gas price to rise as well, but the administration's actions have deliberately contributed to this rise. He specifically said in 2008 before he was elected, that high gas prices aren't a problem, that Americans are mad only because they rose so high so quickly. He would prefer a gradual price increase. The administration has refused to permit increased energy production domestically.

The administration is doing this even though the average American commutes approximately 33 miles to work and back daily via automobile.

746,"Film was not essentially filmed theatre back in the 50s and 60s. It was a very well established medium with its own conventions, even before sound was introduced, to an extent, and definitely by the end of the 1930s at the least. There were certainly periods of time in different national cinemas where it was popular to emulate theatre (and other forms of art/entertainment). Think film's relation to vaudeville in the US in the first 10-15 years after it was introduced here. Or the distinct influence that literature had on early Russian cinema. Film wasn't really respected as an art form for awhile, so outside influences and wild experimentation were rampant (which made the silent era really exciting) and the lack of conventions or an established filmic language really let those influences take over. For example, when the Lumière brothers started shooting moving pictures, there wasn't much to go off of other than what they knew because nobody had done this before. So when you look at their work, you can really see their influences from photography come through. The same can be said with Méliès and his background as a magician. This wasn't really the case by the 20s and 30s (there was the introduction of sound and that was obviously a drastic change, but it would be unnecessarily dismissive of the silent era to claim that it hadn't become an established medium with its own conventions).

Sound plays an important part in this question though, because I think we as modern viewers are so used to great video and sound technology and that almost everything we watch is perfectly synced and comparable to what we experience in real time. It was a real pain in the ass to develop sync sound and it is expensive and difficult to shoot. Directors like Godard and Fellini would dub some of their films after shooting and they were not alone (although there were other reasons for this too, like shouting directions and lines). That said, everything isn't as obvious as something like *8 1/2*, but I would argue that there was often just enough of a disconnect for a modern viewer to think that something might be ""off"" even if they can't pinpoint it. This gets covered up a bit with films in a language you don't understand, but even in Hollywood productions that had access to better technology something might still feel off because the sound technology wasn't as good or as reliable as it is today. And even today, sound is one of the hardest technical aspects of filmmaking to get right. So while sound isn't the only reason, I'd argue that it's part of the explanation for it and I definitely disagree with the claim that films and the acting in them were just filmed theatre, especially as late as the 50s and 60s.",movies

It's not like there's ever a solo Mercy or Ana being suplimented by a Soldier or Sombra. Because you can't DPS and heal at the same time, especially soldier, it's far too distracting to drop that biotic field when other teammates are around. It's much more effective for soldier to run behind cover and save all the heals for just himself.

And Sombra builds ult much more quickly when you don't hack health packs near your team and just focus on damage.

No one would ever run 3 tanks, what would we ever call that... triple tank, no that sounds stupid.

I just [read](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlar_xava) what's that (didn't knew). And well I would call it ""Catalan language annihilation"" xD I'm all for the Catalan standardization/purification, avoiding *[barbarismes](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarisme)*/*castellanismes* and similars. I believe the Catalan we speak now is better than the one people spoke here 40 years ago (the Dictatorship damaged a lot Catalan language). My grandmother still says incorrectly ""*abogado*"" (lawyer) instead of the correct Catalan word ""*advocat*"". Even my father makes that mistake (not now, after I insisted him about it). People from my generation will always say ""*advocat*"", since we already assimilated that's the correct word. There are many examples of words where we use the incorrect Spanish word instead of the Catalan one: ""*berberecho*"" (escopinya), ""*jabalí*"" (porc senglar), etc.

I believe we have to keep working on that direction, to preserve the Catalan language; instead of devaluating it into some kind of Spanish.

&gt; I love expressions like ""el passadis está tancado""

I hate this xD I mean, that's not Catalan. Not Spanish neither. A mix from both languages. People don't usually talk like this here: you chose a language, either Catalan or Spanish. But talking both at the same time in the same sentence... well, at least I have not seen it. And I don't like it all hahaha

""Of all the pieces, I felt ‘Meistersinger’ was difficult for me to deal with because of the nature of the investigation of German culture and German identity and the history of the piece,' he said. The work’s finale is a monologue delivered by the opera’s hero, the cobbler Hans Sachs, that is a rousing defense of “holy German art,” and a warning that it must be safeguarded against foreign incursions.""

------
Ok so what is going on here? 

German Culture/Heritage is a bad thing? And since German= bad it's necessary to boycott 200 year old opera . And if you deride and censor you get rewarded with positive publicity and a worldwide audience, being led by the article into the idea Wagner, German Heritage, culture is terrible and evil and should be ignored and shamed. 

Why is it ok to malign entire cultures and nations like that, and not get challenged? Why is it socially acceptable to exclusively denigrate European heritage, art, and history?


This Opera dude who is the subject in the article later decided to do Wagner after all, once he figured out how to subvert it to his vision. 


2017. Being openly racist and hateful to European heritage is socially acceptable to the point that you earn a featured article in the NYT.  Imagine taking statements like these and applying them to any other racial group. 

If he despises Wagner so much why not use a celebrated opera composer who shares his heritage?  

The answer is opera was not an artistic medium in the rest of the world. 

Why make a career out of a medium that is entirely based and formed out of a heritage and history he hates?

I just state my opinion on matters. right or wrong is all subjective. 

&gt; But I also think that we could have given him a fair trial, and a just sentence for his crimes against our country and our greatest ally.

But we didn't have control of him. He was under the Control of the United States who had their own rules and they were playing by them.

&gt;Instead, our government, and its agents, were complicit in the denial of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that are fundamental to our country, 

That do not apply when you country has no Jurisdiction. 

&gt;We don't get to pick and choose when to deny someone's rights under the Charter

By your logic since charter applies on foreign soil. We should allow any Americans living in Canada the right to own weapons? because I mean we're denying them their charter rights.

Of qualified starters, only Clayton Kershaw and Robbie Ray have done better this year. With runners in scoring position, batters have managed only a .128 AVG. This is the best mark in baseball. The next closest this year are Keuchel and Kershaw, respectively .143 and .145 averages against with runners in scoring position. Since 2002 (that's as far back as FanGraphs' splits will take you) no qualified starting pitcher has has this dominant an AVG against with RISP. If you believe in clutch pitching, Gio has mastered it.

.128 w/RISP in 2017 (.186 BABIP in those ABs)

.333 w/RISP in 2016 (.393 BABIP in those ABs)

.272 w/RISP in 2015 (.311 BABIP in those ABs)

I'd put the chances that at age 31 he has all of a sudden mastered ""clutch pitching"" at about 0%. There's just no reason to think he has when looking at these numbers, and his other numbers. It's only 85 ABs w/RISP. It's a very small sample size.

Perhaps, Jon began to suspect something peculiar and that's what lead him to the book that records all the births of noble houses.

Littlefinger plays the long con. Always several steps ahead.  Suppose Jon was sterile... Littlefinger to the rescue!  He gives Lysa an Arryn heir that is his son. This keeps Lysa in his pocket for as long as he needs. And makes it easy to convince her to murder her husband.  Because then she murders Jon Arryn to protect herself, LF, and their son, Robin.

1581,"So this was the first MCU movie I'd see since Avengers 1. I like Spider-Man a lot so I was pretty hyped. 

It was alright. I thought that Holland, RDJ, and Keaton were very good. The scene in Washington was awesome, and I appreciated the fact that we got to see Spidey in new and unique places for the character. No Manhattan, just the suburbs, warehouses, Queens, etc. That was cool. 

I was really perplexed by the ""nerdiness"" of Peter, more than I was in any of the Spider-Man films. He's an attractive, smart kid, and he seems to keep to himself. There is no way this kid would get picked on at the rate he does, it's just ludicrous. It's middle school stuff. And did we ever see why Liz likes him? She likes Spider-Man, sure, but Peter is a total flake to her time and time again. I get that he's smart and handsome (as said earlier) but it seems they just made them a thing for the reveal that Vulture was her dad (which was cool). And I hope that this is not the new MJ. She was a fun enough character but I could do without yet another quirky, witty person. Couldn't there be a regular love interest? Liz was better for that. 

The lack of stakes is annoying as well. I think that one character in this entire movie died, and there was a weird quip right after. 

Good movie overall, I'd give it a 5-6/10 but I'd rather that we'd gotten an adult Peter Parker in Raimi's Spider-Man 4. ",movies

Yes but the key is the fineprint here. You can only apply asly if you enter Germany, you need to hit the ground, if the close the border and refuse your entry you can't. Thats the point.

Another way is to use transit zone like at the airports (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_zone ), you can not leave them until the agree (e.g. until you have a all papers) that is something Hungary uses and is under fire for it, another idea from the CSU.

There was a rulling in a other case: The court of Justice of the European Union confirmed that we don't need to grant a humanitarian visa via embassy: https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-03/cp170024en.pdf

No doubt that another law would get challenge in court up to the EU but the simple truth is, we could do way more then we do now but Merkel does the best she always do -&lt;&gt;- 

Could be a interesting year if Germany would refuse more entrys (~300.000k alone waiting for family asyl visa) and Italy refuses to let any kind of refugee ships to the harbours, now that would put the EU/Nations under pressure. We can still absorb the numbers but with all the shit that happens around us plus the climate change that will hit Africa and the Middle East like a sledgehammer, we better try to fix the problems now but we fail even with the ""little"" numbers we agree on to help Italy and Greece a few month ago.

Space is interconnected with areas of our own consciousness. The dream plane, and astral plane, and what they call 'space' are all synonymous as reflections of our own conscious Ness. That is the nature of reality.

Now, you may not believe this but the secret societies that have created this deception mockingly worship a satanic deity called Baal.

There is a true evil that has gained control of this country, and is trying to control the whole world into a false reality to maintain control over our awareness, as part of the illusion to use us as a corporate entity. Slaves. They want to keep us slaves and they hide our true reality from us and dangle some false expansion of reality in front of our faces as something to strive for.

But the real awakening is connecting your consciousness with the world around you. When you dream you go to a less dense area of consciousness. We reflect that area as Space. That's just the beginning. The ancients knew how to merge the dream plane with the physical plane. There is true spiritual power in each individual to knowingly alter their light body, and the light in the world around them. There is an interconnectedness between each of us that is always experienced on the dream plane. They want to keep this from happening. They want us divided, separated, and unknowing of our conscious reality.",conspiracy

1732,"I think part of the reason is that CGI is in the same place electronic music was in the 80s.

A whole world is newly opened to people and (to quote Jurrasic Park) the director and artists are making decisions bsed on what they *can* do not what they *should* do.

Despite it being held up as an example, I think the hallway scene clip (under 2. Room Scanning) is still a little in the uncanny valley. As the narrator says at 2:45 - ""with animation complete the director can design more compelling camera work for a scene"". But personally I think this is one of its main weaknesses. Just as *Polar Express* looked wrong back in the day because audiences instinctively know how humans move, we also know how *cameras* move and here they neither feel right nor emphasize what the action *means*. It's just ""interesting"" camera movement for its own sake. With all that's happening in an action scene - in the middle of watching, this could be missed but when focused on - it stands out.

Similarly, I think the claw swipe is week. - Sure it's a cool idea, but swiping through half a dozen lockers involves putting each claw through multiple layers of sheet metal that have different thicknesses and different angles at different moments through the swipe. The smoothness of the move contradicts physics principles audiences have experienced their whole lives and feels inauthentic. Much better to cut and show the swipe in a different way, possibly with more power for the audience.

“An employee’s use of medical marijuana under these circumstances is not facially unreasonable as an accommodation of her handicap.”

In other words, there are conceivable situations in which firing someone for using medical cannabis as part of doctor-approved treatment would indeed violate disabilities statues.

The dominant ones would pick on everyone and everyone would take out their aggression on the baboons lower down the pecking order than themselves. If you were at the bottom you had it the worst. The bottom-level baboons had all kinds of stress-induced illnesses that a lot of humans have too. 

Fun story: A restaurant near the baboon preserve had a dump out back and the baboons would forage around it for scraps. The dominant males took all the meat for themselves, of course, and left nothing for anyone else. Then they started dropping dead. _All_ the dominant males dropped dead. It turns out the meat was tainted with hepatitis. By being greedy fucks who cared nothing for anyone else they rather ironically saved the entire group from extinction.

What was amazing was the way the culture of the group changed after all the douche bags dropped dead. There were far fewer fights, less stress, more grooming behaviors. Everyone was a lot happier and a lot better off.

You are also talking about private, top-tier universities in America. I am not. I am talking about the average, huge college in the US compared to a university in Canada. Especially a province like Ontario. You need a minimum of a B average just to be looked at for any university in Toronto. You also need to know exactly what you want to do from the 11th grade. Pick a wrong course? Sorry, no program admittance. Good luck getting in University of Toronto for a difficult program with less then a 90 percent average. I also suggest looking up how our percentage based system compared to that in the US. A B average here is an A average there. Which is why international universities require LOWER grade average from students who transfer from Canada (like Ontario), then the states. 

Also, please don't link online schools. I am not talking about schools where your degree is irrelevant. Although if you get a degree from Arizona you are laughed off the face of the earth in America. That degree is still looked at fairly well abroad because they honestly don't know the difference between a party school and a legitimate one. 

How do I know all this? I have people I know who went to school in the states because they couldn't get into a university in Toronto. They spent two years down there and were accepted to transfer to York and UofT here. Once they got here the course work was significantly more difficult, but still graduated.

There are at least four primary threads of Freemasonry, not counting all of the look-alikes and pretenders (like the Chinese Freemasons and the crazy fly-by-night franchises of fake Masonry in urban America). Those four are:

* English Freemasonry (the largest single group, including many spin-offs that mutally reocgnized each other such as the major Grand Lodges in the US states, at least one Grand Lodge in each European nation, Australia and so on).
* ""Continental"" Freemasonry which started in France under the Grand Orient de France and has since spread to nearly every part of the globe under its primary auspices or related spinoffs like Le Droit Humain.
* Prince Hall Freemasonry in the United States which began under segregation as the ""black Lodges"" but are now a wholly distinct tradition, variously recognized or not by each state's mainstream Grand Lodge.
* Scandinavian Freemasonry is a hybrid of traditions that came out of France combined with the state Lutheran Churches of most Scandinavian countries. Very much a Christian-only spin on Freemasonry with a distinct look and allegorical basis. Recognized by the English Grand Lodges.

This doesn't count all of the side-orders and secondary groups like the Shriners, Scottish Rite, etc., all of which tend to be duplicated within each strain except for the Scandinavian traditions where they have a much more linear system of 10 degrees and few if any side-orders.

1865,"&gt;In Overwatch, whether your MMR goes up or down is contingent on winning or losing. But there are a number of factors that determine how much that rating goes up or down. For example, what map you’re playing on and whether you were attacking or defending is factored in. We know the win rates on attack/defend on all of the maps and we normalize accordingly. Not all wins and losses are equal. We also look at your individual performance on each of the heroes you played during the match. Everyone has better and worse heroes and we have tons of data showing us what performance levels should be like on those heroes. We also look at your opponents and whether or not their matchmaking rating is higher or lower than yours. These are just a few of the things that are considered when determining how your skill should go up or down. At no point in MMR calculations do we look at your win/loss ratio and win/loss ratio is never used to determine who to match you with or against. We are not trying to drive your win/loss percentage toward a certain number (although the fact that so many people are at 50% win rates makes us extremely happy). All the system does when it comes to matching on skill is attempt to match you with people of a similar number. 

&gt;

&gt;The system is of course deeper than this. There are penalties and handicaps added for things like not playing for a while or playing in groups of varying sizes. We also do special things for brand new players to (hopefully) keep them away from the general population. Players will often mistakenly look at player level and accuse the matchmaker of making unfair matches. One thing that I have mentioned before is that we were evaluating your skill during closed beta, open beta and the second stress test weekend. If you played in any of these (over 10 million players did), we had already determined a skill rating for you (most likely). This means that it’s not uncommon to see a level 1 matchmade against much higher level players.  In most of these cases, the Level 1 is a skilled player who played during the phases I mentioned but did not immediately play at launch.

&gt;

&gt;There are many factors that are beyond our control that add noise to the matchmaking system.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;•        Leavers are extremely disruptive

&gt;

&gt;•        Players vary wildly in their skill with different heroes. We have no clue which of the 21 heroes you are going to play during a match

&gt;

&gt;•        Groups form with wild variance in skill levels and ping. Contrary to popular belief there is not a “perfect match” for your unique snowflake group

&gt;

&gt;•       Sometimes your little brother plays on your account

&gt;

&gt;•       Sometimes the cat walks in front of the screen

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes your wireless mouse runs out of batteries. (Why do you use a wireless mouse btw?)

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes a highly skilled player buys a new copy of OW to “start fresh” on a new account

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes you have internet problems

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes you play drunk or tired… or both

&gt;

&gt;•        That first game of the night…

&gt;

&gt;•        …that last game of the night

&gt;

&gt;•        “Life”

&gt;

&gt;So this brings me to some thoughts I’ve been having about Overwatch. While this whole post has been mostly my personal thoughts – this next part is “especially” my thoughts and not reflective of the team or the company’s POV. 

&gt;

&gt;For better or for worse, we focused the design of the game on winning or losing as a team. OW is not a game where you ignore the map objectives and then look at your K/D ratio to determine how good you are. We want you to focus on winning or losing and as a result you do focus on winning or losing. We tried to make it so that losing isn’t the end of the world, but to a lot of people they expect to win far much more than they lose. I sometimes wonder if we were able to clone you 11 times and then put you in a match with and against yourself, would you be happy with the outcome? Even if you lost? Out of the 5 types of matches I described above, it is my belief that you would still experience types 1-4. Are those “stomps” still not acceptable? Because they will happen…

&gt;

&gt;And I believe OW is strange game in that regard. I spend a lot of time studying the matches that I am in because I am very focused on matchmaking. I’ve been in so many Control Point maps where my team got destroyed on the first point, the enemy team got destroyed on the second point and then we play the third point to a 99%/99% overtime. If you judged any of those single points on their own merits you could say you have two stomps (one in your favor, one against you) and one close match. Same players...no change in matchmaking. Or take a match that I was just in on Route 66, for example. My team was on attack and could barely push out past the train cars. Two members of our team swapped heroes and we proceeded to march the payload all the way to the end of the map practically uncontested. The match went from a stomp in one direction to a stomp in the other direction.

&gt;

&gt;So while it is possible for a mismatch to result in a stomp, not every stomp is a mismatch. If every time a team dominates another team it is viewed as “the matchmaker is broken”, the problem we have is with perception and expectations. Look across all pro sports. Even matches happen every night. Stomps happen every night. It’s a reality of any competitive game. Does that make being on the receiving end sting any less – probably not.

&gt;

&gt;We are constantly improving the matchmaker. We learn more each day. We have one of our best engineers and best designers full time dedicated to the system. Many of those “silent” patches that go out during the week are adjustments to the system. For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy – they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match. The worst part was, by the time he finally got a match, he had been waiting so long that the system had “opened up” to lower skill players. Now one of the best Widowmaker players was facing off against players at a lower skill level. As a result, we’ve disabled the Avoid system (the UI will go away in an upcoming patch). The system was designed with the best intent. But the results were pretty disastrous.

&gt;

&gt;We will always be working on our matchmaking system. We’re listening to feedback, we’re playing the game a ton ourselves and we’re looking at hard data to inform our decisions. This post wasn’t my way of saying everything is fine. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts as someone who has been evaluating the system itself very closely as well as monitoring the feedback. I want to put it out there that there is a lot of room for improvement but also suggest that there are forces in play that cause some fair matches to sway lopsided due to forces out of our control. The game is as much (if not more) art than it is science. We’ll keep working to make it better!

I didnt mention other players impacting your SR but its possible that they do... Its just that the more games you play, the less likely it is that they are to blame. The way the system is designed to work is that you will fluctuate between a range of SR. Its hard to say what your ""true"" SR is because when you win and lose your SR will obviously vary. I also think that the system aims to counterbalance the lack of ""perfect"" games with all of the horrible games you have. This isn't a perfect system mind you but I feel like in the long run you will eventually have your SR stop improving as much when your W/L is at around 50%.",Overwatch

&gt; Peter and Kerry began as an impulsive side-project. The two solo artists, who had become close friends following a years' worth of label-related activities, decided to make use of some spare time one weekend in the late-Summer. Having never fully-collaborated, the duo bravely embarked upon an uninterrupted writing and recording session which took place over several days at Peter's family home in Southampton.

&gt; They returned to London with a finished record. The release, entitled 'Clothes, Friends, Photos EP', has since gathered critical acclaim from blogs, magazines and radio stations worldwide; what began as a whimsical experiment has become an exciting new outlet. Read more on Last.fm.

-

LT1 -- Terron Armstead --
	Everyone knows the story by now, Armstead is a freak athlete of lineman when he is actually on the field but that is something that is becoming less and less frequent with each passing season. If Ramczyk performs well enough this season we could see another Jamal Brown/Jermon Bushrod situation that sees Armstead being traded at the end of the season. I would hate to see Armstead go but the team has proven again and again they can replace tackles fairly easy.

-

LG1 --  Andrus Peat --
	Peat has responded very well for the situation he has found himself in over the first 2 years of his career. After being bounced around every position except C over that time frame he has finally settled in as the starting LG. He has his ups and downs but hes a quality starter and will only get better as he matures.

-

C -- Max Unger--
	So Unger is a Top 10 C in the league, good at pass pro and run blocking... when he’s healthy. Hopefully, he will be available by the start of the season if not the team will be pushing out whomever looks the best by the end of TC in his stead.

-

RG1 -- Larry “War Daddy” Warford --
	A quality starter signed away from Detroit due to up and down play and injury. The Saints value guards more than most teams because of the way Brees has to move in the pocket to avoid pressure and clear his throwing lanes.  Peat and Warford should pair nicely to keep Brees clear from pressure up the middle.

-

RT1 -- Zach “Old Man” Strief --
	Strief continues to perform at an above average level despite the fact he will be 34 in September. I've always been a big fan of him and he was rewarded with a bit of a raise this offseason. He is a respected locker room presence and one of the handful of players over the age of 30 on the team. His age is the only limiting factor here and Ramczyk will be the starter sooner rather than later

-

OT -- Ryan Ramczyk -- What was going to be a potential training camp battle between Strief and Ramczyk has been put on hold for the time being as Ramczyk will be called on to start in the injured Armsteads place. He has the so called ""mass and ass"" that Sean Payton apparently looks for in a man and he looks like a good technician in the tape I've seen on him. He was ranked as the top OT in the draft by multiple picks and I really liked him at 32.

-

OT -- Bryce Harris (probable cut) -- Harris has been around the league as a spot tackle filling in for injury and bouncing off practice squads. He has appeared in a few regular season games as the Saints swing tackle. If he has a solid camp he could stick on as depth, especially considering the Saints penchant for injuries but I think he gets replaced by one of the younger linemen at this point

-

OT -- Khalif Barnes -- (probable cut, re-signed, and cut again) I cant help but respect Barnes as being a consummate professional last year. He was re-signed or cut 8 total times by the team last year.  He, Strief and Unger are the veterans of the O-line playing over 300 games combined, that is a lot of experience in the film room and on game day. Barnes will probably rotate in all season again due to injury or specific game plans, something he seems to have no problem with at this point in his career.

-

OT/G/C -- Senio Kelemete -- Senio has filled in all over the Saints line and I do mean every where. He will make the team barring injury, he is simply too versatile to not make it. He will probably be the front runner to fill in for Unger if he cant make it back in to for the start of the season.

-

OG -- Landon Turner -- A good young Guard who signed with the team as a UDFA last season. He impressed enough in TC/PS to make the roster and played in 7 games and started 1. I think he will continue to improve and be a quality backup going forward.

-

OG -- John Fullington (Probable Cut) -- Another lineman that has bounced around various practices squads in the league. I expect that to continue here, I dont see him having a legitimate chance to even show he's capable of beating out someone for their job.

-

OG -- Josh LeRibeus (Probable Cut) -- The same can be said of LeRibeus that can be said of Fullington, a journeyman OL whose been around for a few years. These spots are used by teams to evaluate and add players to their ""short list"" to sign mid-season if/when injuries dictate they need to fill a spot.

-

C -- Jack Allen (Practice Squad Candidate) -- Another UDFA signing from last year. He was on the PS for most of the year but made an active roster appearance in December. He will get the chance to compete for the backup position behind Unger.

-

C -- Chris Watt (Possible Cut) -- A player signed in FA after the Unger news broke. Watt had previously started for the Chargers before getting hurt and waived last season. The Saints were impressed enough to sign him and he will be the main challenge to Kelemete for starting in Unger's stead...if he's healthy

-

C -- Tom Cameron (Possible Practice Squad Candidate) -- The last center on the roster. A UDFA out of Southern Miss. I doubt he will seriously threaten anyone's job this year but he might find a home on the PS

1979,"Hi.  Applied Physics grad student here.

My opinion of Green Party tinfoilness aside, this is a really misleading and inaccurate analysis.  

When comparing two sources of EM radiation, you can't just compare the total power of the two.  The reason is that the vast vast majority of the Sun's power output comes from frequencies far higher than WiFi frequencies (which is in the GHz range, typically 2.4 GHz).  In fact to get an exact look, check out the [solar spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png).  To find out exactly how the sun's output changes with frequency, check out [blackbody radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation).  You'll find the intensity of the sun's rays drop off quickly as you move away from the visible spectrum.  You can even calculate exactly how much power the earth recieves from the sun around the 2.4 GHz that WiFi operates at.  I won't do the integral because it's 10:30 and I'm a little drunk.  But suffice to say it won't be anywhere close to the '6 orders of magnitude greater' you quoted.

Now obviously we've evolved in such a way that the total 1700 W/m^2 of solar irratidation doesn't kill us, but that doesn't mean that a lesser total amount of radiation focused at one specific frequency won't be harmful.  That being said, any high school physics student can tell you that E=hv, meaning the higher frequency the EM radiation hitting you the more likely it is to fuck you up.  The bulk of the photons coming from the sun are have 1000 times as much energy as those from WiFi, not to mention they are way more populus.

So Tl;dr: Is WiFi going to give us cancer?  No, probably not.  That being said, don't use shit science to combat shit science.",canada

&gt; I don't know much about his earlier career,

And I've been following his career since he was drafted. I own a Bradford jersey. I'm not the one looking in a vacuum here, I'm looking at the full body of work.

&gt; he was also statistically above average in almost every category.

Not turning the ball over and completing a lot of passes will go a long way towards those efficiency stats. But the reality is, he was average at best. That's why context matters. Comp% and YPA are directly related. The better one's comp%, the better their YPA. Sam Bradford broke the single season comp% record and had a below average YPA. That's a huge red flag.

Passer Rating and AY/A are very similar stats. They use the same base stats. One gives more weight to TD/INT ratio and puts out an arbitrary number. The other gives more weight to yards and converts TDs and INTs to yards for a yards per attempt average. In most cases, the ranking of these two stats should be very similar. Bradford was 6th in Passer Rating and 14th in AY/A. Again, a huge red flag.

That's great that Bradford doesn't turn the ball over. It's why he still has a job. But he doesn't do anything else with the ball either. Doesn't score much. Doesn't throw more than a few yards beyond the LoS much. You might as well run the ball 3 times.  I would rather have a guy with a INT% in the low 2's(Bradford's was 0.9), that actually throws the ball down field and crates plays.

Like Andrew Luck for example. And for the record, I'm not a huge Luck fan. I think he's a pretty overrated QB at this point in his career. Anyway...In 15 games for each, you lose 8% in comp% and he had a 1.5% drop in INT%. As a result, the passer rating is down a couple points as well. Who thinks Sam Bradford is a better QB than Andrew Luck? Anyone? Because for those 'flaws,' Luck had 11 more TDs(+2.1 TD%), almost 400 more yards, and half a yard more per attempt. And to show for it, he had a winning record vs Bradford's losing record. He did this behind a shitty line, only one good receiver, a shitty run game, and a shitty defense. So a pretty similar team to the Vikings, except instead of a top 5 defense, it was bottom 5. So toss that supporting cast argument right out the window.

Good QBs make their teams better.

Bradford doesn't directly lose games, but the team loses because he doesn't go out an win them either. He's a good stopgap QB, that's about it. He's the first name on the list below the Dalton line. He's the new Ryan Fitzpatrick. He's good enough to keep a job, but you're always looking for his replacement. He may put up some good stats from time to time because the potential was there, but he'll never do it consistently. You will win some games with him, but you're not going to win meaningful games.",nfl

PG that can drive and kick, decent 3 shooter off the ball and finish at the rim. 

3 and D wings that can guard 1-4 on switches.

Stretch 4, preferably quick feet and can switch on D.

Athletic 5 that can protect the rim, rebound and run the floor.

Heat-check 6th man, someone who can score and handle (Lou Will, Eric Gordon etc.)

Decent role player bench guys, each with high energy and one really good skill for certain matchups.

Obviously though for a ""perfect team"", you'd need some superstar talent in there somehow, I'd favor a great wing that can handle the ball and score (LeBron/KD/Kawhi etc.)

Edit - Rough idea for team would be one of these options for each position....

PG - Conley / Dragic

SG - Middleton / Bradley

SF - Ariza / Crowder / Covington

PF - Markieff / Porzingis / H. Barnes

C - Gobert / Turner / C. Zeller

6M - Lou Will/Gordon/Will Barton

Bench - Guys like Delly, Snell, Z-Bo, Teletovic, T. Booker etc. can do something well.

38. [Mogwai - Friend Of The Night - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_3alnTE9g)

Not the greatest Mogwai song, but definetely their greatest video. Art made out of everyday objects, connections being made between feelings and inanimate objects. Such a bold move on the behalf of the director, to try to really find common grounds between the abstract of feeling and the touchable material realm. The sentiment, enclosed in the most absolute subjectivity and uncertainty, not ever knowing if what you call happiness or sadness is universal when you express them verbally to another person, these are themes that are depicted in this amazing video. The music has no words, and the director uses fantastic images and objects to reproduce the mood of the song, chasing a chaotic trail of thought. A journey worth loosing yourself into.

37. [Titiyo - Stumble to fall - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkbh0_juEGg)

You might want to watch this with your significant other, but not necesarily. An amazing song, fantastic voice and instrumental, with scenes of what's basically, people making sweet love. As the case with Parov Stelar's ""Powder"", this song can go both ways, depending on what you feel, or what you maybe want to feel. Clean, simple video and huge, passionate sound make this video go above average because of the haunting calm it resonates. Enjoy, miss or wish for - now, in the past or in the future. These are six out of the eight facets of a geometrical shape made out of time and feeling, with it's bases being the two lovers. This is what you'd expect to find yourself pondering about when watching this video. 

36. [Benga and Coki - Night - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNStVlJWy88)

Got something for all you dubstep lovers out there as well, a gift for the love of bass that I began to feel once I heard my first proper dubstep track. For all the skeptics, there really IS good dubstep out there if you're patient enough to find it. This is a legendary tune, a stepping stone for what would be the great commercial coming out party for dubstep, with a video that matches it's simplicity but imagination-provoking capabilities. As a special treat, for all of you who love dubstep, you should not miss [THIS ONE](http://www.mixcloud.com/erwtenpeller/a-dubstep-version-of-war-of-the-worlds/). Erwtenpeller's War of the Worlds dubstep remix is a piece of art. Couldn't put this on the list, for it has no video. Unfortunately, dubstep and drum and bass videos are scarce and of poor quality, so many will not make the list, but if there are requests, I can make a top 10 or top 20 dubstep/dnb list. 

35. [Ghost in the Shell: Innocence - Original theme remastered - Fan Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YhFhbrgrH8)

Don't quite know if this will make the cut, in the end, but it seems to have made it this night, we'll see about it when I finish the list. Just a great anime, with a huge soundtrack, I promised a little something for every taste, so this is my personal favorite anime video. Almost like a battle shout, this song makes hair grow on your chest, man or woman, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that at the end of it, you'll feel prepared for pretty much anything. Epic war drums along with haunting antique vocals almost lamenting for war, teach you that discipline is key. Your eyes will probably develop diabetes from this one.

34. [Gabriel Rios - Broad Day Light - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Dy79bXK9I)

Man, I just love a good wake and bake! And this, is the perfect song to do it to. The vocal's just light and smooth, the video somewhat crazy, and the instrumental jumpy and energetic. The kids' voices really bring out the optimism and hope in someone. What could possibly go wrong on a sunny Saturday, waking up with a strong black coffee, some nice dank and this song playing in the background? Whoa, LET'S DO SHIT! Cheese omlette, orange juice, quick shower, and the world is yours. Maybe you need to clean the house up a bit, or maybe it's too nice to stay indoors and should go outside, in the park, everything's a journey from now on!*Lloyd who's got them Polaroids*

33. [Various - Hater - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA1DuuJ6ymc)

Another awesome equalizer-video created by ""Kandle Design"", that goes perfect with the song. The graphics are just amazing, the creator focusing mainly on shape and dynamics rather than color and depth. The complexity of this is mind blowing, and so is probably the number of hours put into this awesome 3D video. A treat for the eyes, but for the ears as well, this will surely take you on it's shoulders and show you what sometimes the Earth looks like to all of us. The phrase ""this means the world to me"" will get a whole new dimension for you from now on, because sometimes, an object, a person, or an activity will get your full attention and it will literally be your sole purpose.

32. [65daysofstatic - Radio Protector - Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cjbA1rGb2k)

A strange and tricky band to listen, 65dos are performing their song, Radio Protector, flawlessly. Not really much to say about the video, except for some really cool close-ups of the guys, helping you see the dedication and concentration on their faces. The song is just huge and powerful, intense would be the word I'd use if I only had one to describe this song. Also, the lights. It's a purple haze, guys.

31.[Queens Of The Stone Age - Go With The Flow - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcHKOC64KnE)

Man when I first saw this one on MTV2 in 2003 or 2004 I was blown away. Not only was the song unbelievable awesome, but the video was just great. Rendered in black, white and red, it's dynamic, fast and full of adrenaline. The high school boy that I was would never be the same after experiencing this video blazed-as-fuck on a hot summer Friday night, munching on caramels and drinking cold home-made ice coffee, enjoying the few moments of comfortable silence I had back when living with my parents. The song's wiki page says the video has been filmed in England, which is totally surprising. It gave me the impression of a long interstate desert road from the States. The symbols, sound and band starring this clip are the epitome of epic bad assery. This video is, if I dare say it, cool! Yes, I said it, gonna go out and buy myself one of those hats with a tiny fan on it now.

30. [Dirty Three - Some Summers They Drop Like Flies - Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbWTUtScWa4)

You really have to be patient with this one, it has a slow start, and the audio is kind of bad to begin with anyway, so when I first found this I was quite skeptical to be honest, but I really enjoyed what I stumbled upon. Dirty Three is an Australian band, creating some entrancing, gorgeous, romantic, lustful, optimistically melancholic instrumental music there to sooth your ears if you are in the right mood for it. Really great music to fall asleep to, but also to get lost into.",trees

For example they didn't follow the whole drop (effectively increasing the gap) because they perceived higher risk in the increasing amount of lending at lower rates.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/7cff105128ec4962ab163236504d9e63.png)  

&gt; Whitney Houston (born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey, death announced February 11, 2012 in Los Angeles, California) was a Grammy and Emmy Award winning American R&amp;B/pop singer, actress, former fashion model, record and movie producer. Whitney Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with more than 200 million combined albums, singles, and videos sold worldwide. She was known for her soulful dramatic mezzo-soprano voice, vocal power, range and melismatic skill.  She was labeled the ""Queen of Songs"" by Arsenio Hall, who described her as ""the first lady of song"". She was also known to millions as ""The Voice"", a nickname given to her by Oprah Winfrey. Also known as the ""Queen of Pop/Soul"", or soulful-pop music. 

&gt; Whitney's debut album was released in 1985 to critical and commercial international success, and she went on to release seven consecutive number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of a handful of African-American artists who received heavy-rotation on MTV during the network's early years in the 1980s.

&gt; Houston continued her success into the 1990s with the release of several films and their corresponding soundtrack albums, the most popular of which was The Bodyguard (1992), which produced the worldwide number-one hit single I Will Always Love You. According to the  I Will Always Love You Songfacts, it stayed at US #1 for 14 weeks, which was a record at the time and for a while was second to ""We Are The World"" as the biggest-selling single ever. Houston's albums in the 2000s have been less successful.

&gt; Her personal life became the subject of controversy because of allegations of drug abuse, especially after repeated cancellations of public appearances and erratic behaviour. 

&gt; In mid 2009, Houston released her seventh and final studio album, ""I Look To You."" The album debut at #1 on the Billboard 200. It became another Platinum seller. It was state in the UK Newspaper ""The Mirror"" that Houston is thinking about recording her eighth studio album.

&gt; Her death was announced by her publicist on February 11, 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

2155,"Okay, my previous answer was not the most serious one, and that's my fault, I'm sorry. I'll try to explain my reasoning and object your criticisment on some points.

&gt;And that's an easy way of saying that the medium is already laughed at by the majority of people, what is another awful, weird, perverted piece of trash to the already negative stigma.

That's not the only reason anime is still stigmatized today. It's a combination of the previous generation not understanding that hand-drawn animation can show a complex and mature story, and the general ""japanese are weird because I automatically believe that their weirdest shit is common amongst them"" mentality. Hentai didn't help either in creating a positive picture about anime. Compared to these, trashy harem shows don't contribute as much to the stigma as you think. Most people who hold up this stigma don't even know these shows exists.

&gt;You didn't call them stupid, but you somehow implied that when it became about incest it is somehow worse than the already inherently sexist bullshit that is harem.

I did not want to imply that it became worse. Probably something has gone missing in translation (English is not my first language). I wanted to express my distaste of having an acceptable background story and setup sinked in order to give more ground to the siblings', at the very least, questionable relationship. As for the harem genre: I do not find the setup bullshit. I find it something well within in the borders of disbelief - I know it's unrealistic and 99% of the time it's a power fantasy intended for the audience, but it's not impossible in terms of reality. This is why I can't really describe it as a sexist genre, either: it's blatantly obvious that these girls (or guys, let's not forget about reverse harems) don't exist in real life and they are not intended to be a example to be followed, but they still don't break my suspension of disbelief, and I do believe that it's the same for the majority of the watchers of the show.

&gt;However, there are plenty of series out there that do what Eromanga does but better, maybe not a lot better, but better. At least those shows have a modicum of storytelling and character development that actually affects the flow of the narrative. Why not watch those? That way you are promoting entertainment that at least has some value to this looping industry.

It was not my intention to defend Eromanga-sensei over other shows even in the same genre. I was not promoting it either. I just said that I liked it. Look at this thread: the original theme is about shows that are popular on this subreddit, but the original posters of the show have a disagreement about this. That's where I wrote my shortened experience with the show. I did not recommend it, nor did I asked people to not watch it. Actually, I have another comment in this thread about Kuzu no Honkai and even when I have strong negative feelings about the show, I stayed neutral in it's recommendation. 

&gt;I don't look for different things in different pieces of entertainment. I look to be entertained. That's it. If i'm not entertained then I can analyse why.

That's perfectly fine, but...

&gt;However, genres really don't have much to do with that.

Yes they do. Genres have a different set of tropes which are to be used, discarded, subverted, etc., and as such give us the story. But you can't have the same valueing system for two different sets of tropes. That's like complaining about a marble statue not being colorful enough.

&gt;Studios really don't matter. They don't. Some have their signature trademark or directors and that's great and they can bring their own personal touches to otherwise over-done ideas.

Yeah, I should have said that studios don't really matter in a meaningful way, but since there is difference in experience staff and overall style between them, it's important to mention them as a factor, even as a small one. For example, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer from Trigger, the animation is lacking to say the least, but it's acceptable from Trigger, since it's their style. I wouldn't accept the same quality from Madhouse or KyoAni.

&gt;But once again, if those touches/ideas aren't inherently entertaining to the critic, why give leniency?

Because not every critic thinks like you or me. Their aim is to reach a majority of approvement among the critics. If this does not happen, then yes, it was a mistake from them, but if it happens, it'd hurt the industry to prevent them from continuing it.

&gt;It does to me. And since i'm only speaking for myself, then I have every right to say that it brings nothing to the table because it honestly doesn't to me, or to anyone who has a critical eye for anything.

And here we are again. Continuing from the previous point: Not everyone thinks the same, but you don't realize that. You think of yourself as an objective criticist, but you're really, really subjective. You think that only your opinion can be critically acclaimed, and that's inherently wrong.

&gt;You can fucking watch paint dry and gain some entertainment out of there somehow. Doesn't mean that it offers anything. It just means you found it entertaining, and just like anything, you might just not have any standards for anything.

I do have standards and preferences. Even if it does not look like it, I have them, just as every other person. I just have different levels of them for different subjects, as I have explained earlier and I think this is right for the abovementioned reasons.

&gt;But don't try pass that off as something people who do have a critical eye for entertainment or any standards whatsoever should try to understand.

Again, I did not do that, I just stated my opinion about the subject.

&gt;You can always pass something off as ""fun"" and that's where the conversation ends. Goodbye. It's fun. Great. Now if you want to talk or criticize something and when your own ideals get argued against and all you do is go fetal and repeat ""it's fun"" over and over again, a conversation doesn't happen and you come off as someone who's wildly insecure about their own tastes as well as completely disingenuous with your own criticisms of anything.

Of course I'm not going to defend Eromanga-sensei. Shit's not worth it. That's why you don't criticize wrestling for being fake, for example. Everyone who is connected to it knows it. Just as everyone knows that if you want to enjoy Eromanga-sensei, you have to lower your expectations. It's not worth more than ""fun things are fun"".

As I'm writing again, I just expressed my personal feelings about the show, and I didn't defend any of it's aspects in my original comments. I did defend the respective genres in my response to you. 

I am EXTREMELY insecure, good realization. Not about my tastes, though. I know what I like and I'm fine with it.

I did avoid having a proper conversation with you about it. I'm sorry, again. Hope this reply is good enough.

If QP was supposed to be a place to practice for Comp, then yeah, of course you'd want there to be the 1-hero limit. And that was probably part of the reason it was implemented. But it simply isn't a good place for that, so I'd rather them just remove the limit and add a proper Unranked mode where people can practice :)

2207,"**Training Camp Battles- Defense (Part II: LB, CB, S)**


**LB: Lerentee McCray vs. Josh McNary vs. Hayes Pullard**

Telvin Smith and Myles Jack are absolute locks to make the roster. Paul Posluszny will, in all likelihood, make the roster (though it’s not a guarantee, as he is no longer the middle linebacker, and is moving to the outside, which is a new position for him). Blair Brown, the fifth round pick out of Ohio that I really like despite his size, will likely make the roster. That leaves 1 or 2 spots left. What makes things interesting is that these linebackers are known for different things, but not all of them will make the roster.

We’ll start with what most Jags fans know, and that’s Hayes Pullard. He made the roster last year after a fantastic preseason, where he [caught a touchdown pass](https://youtu.be/wEWoajhsfoY?t=1m24s) that was negated, [returned an interception for a touchdown](http://www.espn.com/blog/jacksonville-jaguars/post/_/id/18692/jaguars-giving-lb-hayes-pullard-iii-a-long-look-against-falcons), and looked incredibly solid against the second stringers. While he wasn’t known for special teams, he was good on defense; he didn’t play a whole lot in the regular season (he only had 3 tackles on the season, and has 16 tackles in 2 seasons with the Jaguars), but he shined when he got his moment in the preseason.

The problem for him is that the two guys he’s competing against are special teams aces that just so happen to be linebackers. It wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t for the fact that Blair Brown got drafted; when you factor in all of these things, it’s going to be tough for Pullard to make the team. A camp and a preseason like the one he had last year might not even be enough. [Audie Cole](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/free-agency-jaguars-lb-audie-cole-wants-to-take-care-of-business-on-special-teams/422434048) was brought in specifically for special teams, [as was linebacker Lerentee McCray](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/free-agency-jaguars-have-signed-lb-lerentee-mccray/421234182) and linebacker Josh McNary. One of them will be guaranteed to make the roster, and based on how bad our special teams was last year, probably both of them will make the roster (I can’t put into words how bad our special teams looked towards the middle of last season; the Jaguars got burned for one big punt return a game).

What will the Jaguars do? Will they keep two special teams aces, or one special teams ace and one guy that can be plugged in at linebacker if necessary? Pullard is going to have an uphill battle to make the roster this year, but the fact that he’s on the bubble and not an automatic cut (like a guy like PJ Davis is) is saying something about how good he looked in the preseason last year.

**CB: Jalen Myrick vs. Josh Johnson vs. Taurean Nixon**

The Jaguars will likely enter the season with five cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey and AJ Bouye are guaranteed roster spots, and Aaron Colvin will make the roster in the final year of his contract. The final two spots, on the other hand, are up in the air. They could easily go to an UDFA or a camp body that I did not name, such as Ezra Robinson or Brian Dixon, but I doubt that any of those guys have a shot at making the roster. Then again, I didn’t think Josh Johnson had a chance in the world at making the roster last year when I made this post, and after an impressive preseason, he made (and deservedly so) the roster. Basically, when it comes to the backup cornerback battle, [listen to Kevin Garnett for advice on what could happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk).

There are three players fighting for two spots. One of them is Josh Johnson. This man literally had no chance at making the team, but put together one of the most impressive preseason performances I’ve ever seen out of a Jaguars defensive player, to the point where the team had no choice but to keep him. He was a 5’9” cornerback [that had little production in the CFL](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/after-two-years-in-canada-jaguars-cb-johnson-trying-to-make-the-most-of-his-nfl-second-chance/288445127), and he somehow finds his way onto the roster after making play after play in the preseason. So far in 2017, [he’s looked promising](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/josh-johnson-showing-improvement-while-jaguars-starting-cornerbacks-deal-with-injuries/449701303); granted, it’s been without pads, but it’s still a positive sign. He also made, quite possibly, [the best defensive play of the season for the team last year](https://youtu.be/j66Vg__hElk?t=2m49s) with his lone pass breakup of the season against the Colts (although why Andrew Luck didn’t run the ball there, I’m not sure; I’m just glad we won that game because if we didn’t, I would’ve come close to killing my non-football fan roommate… but that’s another story for another day).

His spot on the roster looks good, but you never know. It’s not safe yet, and I’m going to take him off of the bubble (because it’s tough to lock a guy on the roster who barely played once Aaron Colvin came back), but it’s looking promising for him. Jalen Myrick was the seventh round pick that the Jaguars chose this year out of Minnesota, who is lightning fast but is still pretty raw as a cornerback and not polished. At the very least, he’ll find a spot on the practice squad, although in all likelihood, I could see him making the roster as a possible gunner (because that’s a great use for his 4.29 speed).

The wild card in all of this is Taurean Nixon, who was claimed off of waivers almost immediately by the Jaguars after the Broncos cut him earlier in the offseason. The Broncos have a pretty deep secondary, so naturally, some good players are going to fall through the cracks. If a cornerback gets cut from the Broncos, they deserve more consideration than if they get cut from the Ottawa RedBlacks. Seeing as [the move to release Nixon was a surprise](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/14/broncos-waive-taurean-nixon-sign-chris-lewis-harris-in-cornerback-swap/), as he supposedly had an impressive offseason and even intercepted Paxton Lynch for a touchdown, this could be that sneaky pickup by the Jaguars that somehow makes it onto the roster. He’s 6’0”, and Myrick and Johnson are significantly under 6 feet (they’re both 5’9”), so it might help if the Jaguars keep on another tall cornerback.

If I had to make a prediction, Josh Johnson and Taurean Nixon make it onto the roster, with Jalen Myrick going unclaimed and making it onto the practice squad. It really comes down to Nixon against Myrick. Do the Jaguars choose the big, physical cornerback, or the small, raw cornerback with incredible speed?

**S: James Sample vs. Jarrod Wilson**

The two starting safeties are going to be Tashaun Gipson at free safety and Barry Church at strong safety. I’m expecting Peyton Thompson to make the roster as one of the backup safeties, simply because I’m not impressed by anyone else coming for the backup free safety job. Unless Charlie Miller can surprise everyone and actually look good, Thompson will make the roster, barring a waiver claim when final cuts are made. The other safety to make it (since the Jaguars will keep four safeties, and I’d be very surprised if it was any other number) is a bit trickier.

On one hand, you’ve got James Sample, the fourth round pick out of Louisville from 2015. He just can’t stay healthy. In two seasons, he’s only played four games. He suffered a [forearm injury in 2015](https://www.bigcatcountry.com/2015/6/9/8750583/jacksonville-jaguars-daily-rookie-james-sample-to-miss-10-12-weeks) that he tried to play through, but ended up getting placed on IR midway through the season, and in 2016, [he was placed on IR with a shoulder injury](http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/jaguars-james-sample-placed-on-ir/). Basically, he’s barely seen the field. He can’t stay healthy. He was born with glass bones and paper skin, and [every afternoon, he breaks his arms](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbp87aNhe51qbh3dno1_500.png). I can’t even say he’s looked good when he’s healthy, because he’s barely played. His sample size is not very big, pun absolutely intended.

On the other hand, you’ve got Jarrod Wilson. He didn’t exactly look impressive, but the UDFA out of Michigan managed to play all 16 games, so that has to count for something. If you’re an UDFA and you stay on the roster for all 16 games without bouncing down to the practice squad, that’s pretty good. I can’t recall anything specific that he did, but he was there.

Let’s assume that James Sample can stay healthy. Let’s assume that he’s actually able to compete for a spot on the roster this year instead of riding the injured reserve. Who wins the battle? This could be a real toss-up. If everyone stays healthy, then Sample probably wins and gets a legitimate chance to prove himself, with Wilson winding up on the practice squad if he doesn’t get claimed. But in actuality, I’m expecting Wilson to win the battle by default because Sample suffers another injury. I just can’t trust the man to stay healthy.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/1519345dbecf47d5bb76a4c5d7f15fc2.png)  

&gt; Ariel Pink (born Ariel Marcus Rosenberg on June 24, 1978) is a musician who is based in Los Angeles. Pink has been recording his music on tape since 1996 but it wasn't until after he passed a CD-R to the New York-based band Animal Collective that his commercial musical career took off. He attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. Later attending the School of Art at the California Institute of the Arts. 

&gt; Married to Alisa Daniels, July 2002 - they divorced in 2005. He lived with Geneva Jacuzzi for seven years until early 2011.

&gt; He has since caught the attention of various media sources, especially in the Los Angeles area. As most of his albums are self-made, many of them have never been heard by fans. The only albums which have been commercially released come from his ""Haunted Graffiti"" series and are thus the best known.

&gt; Pink produces and plays almost all of his own music, and is noted for creating drum sounds using primarily his mouth, and sometimes his armpits. His home recording technique gives his music a very lo-fi sound, to the point where new listeners may mistake the era of his music.

&gt; Pink cites R. Stevie Moore--friend, mentor, and ""father of home recording""--as one of his major influences. He is sometimes associated with the New Weird America movement, and could also be considered an embodiment of 'The New Sincerity'. Pink boasts a cult following and endorsements from more widely known artists such as fellow Paw Tracks artists Animal Collective.

&gt; Aside from his music, Pink also makes semi-abstract and surreal grotesque drawings, which can be purchased from his unofficial website, ARIEL PINK haunted house, for a hefty price. Read more on Last.fm.

**Aaron Donald** - one of the best players in the NFL and a key piece to our defense.

**Lamarcus Joyner** - started slow but came into his own last year at nickel CB/SAM. Moving to be a FS/Nickel hybrid this year and is a solid player for us. Good pick.

**Tre Mason** - Was a pretty good player, but it appears a mental health issue derailed his career. Was probably a good pick that didn't produce for us because of unfortunate circumstances. 

**Mo Alexander** - Took him a while, but he played very well last year as our starting FS, and should be even better moving to his natural position at SS. Good pick. 

**EJ Gaines** - He's been up and down in his career. Pretty solid rookie year, missed his sophomore season, and was plain bad last year. Trying to come back and play well again, competing for a starting spot with Kayvon Webster. He's an OK pick, can do much worse for a 6th. 

**Garrett Gilbert, Mitchell Van Dyk, Christian Bryant, Michael Sam, Demetrius Rhaney** - All didn't really do shit for us and were late rounder fliers. Didn't work out but 6th/7th rounders don't knock the class down much. 

Notable UDFA - **Ethan Westbrooks**. Competing for a starting DE spot this year and has been a productive player for us in rotation, playing both DE and DT.

Expecting anything less than his full commitment to win isn't what Odell is gonna give you. Odells reaction came from too much contact on both sides of a fiery matchup. He shouldn't done it but it probably wouldn't have happened if Norman had been penalized before it got out of hand. Odell has been the target of tons of contact and out of bound hits in order to rattle him and it pisses him off when those defenders get away with it.

As I said above, I don't think Lukaku was a bad purchase. I'm just of the opinion that some may be overlooking Morata because he had to settle for a ""super-sub"" role behind Benzema and Ronaldo. Personally I want him to stay, but at a certain price it'd be foolish not to accept.

Plus, it's not only tween/teen girls that listen to pop, and on top of that, those teen/tween girls are just starting to discover what music they ""enjoy"" around that age. If rappers can appeal to them at a young age, they can create long term fans.

I dont mean to group all rappers and pop musicians into one category, but a large percentage of these artists dont care about the music, they just do it for the money. Heck, a large percent of the mainstream pop music you hear wasnt even written by the artist it's released under. They buy music off of other songwriters and act as a channel of distribution.

Trolls also consider wisps to be loa, despite the fact that they're not actually loa: they're the ghosts of dead Night Elves.

Considering how Night Elf ghosts clearly haven't been around since the ordering of the world, and that there are also no records of any mortal dying and ascending to loa-hood (coining the term now), it seems to indicate that any return by Vol'jin would technically be a ghost/spirit and not a true loa, regardless of what the trolls call him.",wow

2416,"This was like 6-7 years ago, I was working in a 1$ store. We'd be assigned position for cashier and the 1st cashier would call us for back up in order when needed (so 2nd cashier was going to be there pretty much all day, and 4th cashier and below were going to spend most of their day restocking the alleys). 

I absolutely hated being cashier because my feet hurt a lot when I stand in one place for a long time, people were dicks, and time went by super slowly because the register literally put the time in my face. I much preferred restocking.

The manager was a bitch (she wasn't there when I started working at that place; the previous one was very chill). Like, a legitimate bitch. In the 6 months that I worked there with her as the boss, at least 7 employees quit. I'm talking about employees who, for the most part, had been working there 10+ years. 

When she learned that I preferred restocking to being a cashier, she'd always put me 3rd or 2nd cashier just to piss me off. One time she even put me there from 9 AM to 9 PM because she'd ask for people (who were willing to) to work double shift because the alleys were a mess. I'd volunteered thinking this meant little to no register that day... fucking bitch set me as 2nd cashier.

One day a key holder (supervisor but below the manager) asked me to take the cart where we put all the ""oh, don't want that anymore"" that people give us when they pay and put the stuff back where it belonged. I had been asked by the manager to finish a certain alley, so I told that to the supervisor and she said ""well, she (the manager) said to do this and you're the only one who isn't on a register"". So I did. 

The day after the manager yelled at me in her office because I had not finished restocking my alley. I said I had been told to replace the discarded items, and she said ""NOT BY ME!"". I went to the keyholder (who liked me very much), she went ballistic on the manager lol.

One day I got called to the register. I was at the very back of the store, bringing back empty boxes. I thought I'd just drop the boxes then go to my register. Unfortunately for me she was at the front, and while I was making my way there she called me on the mic to my register. When I got there she berated me for not coming as soon as I got called, I told her I was in the backstore. 1 hour later she made me come to her office to give me a written warning for that (3 of those and you were fired).

Some weeks later I was scheduled to go for lunch a 11 AM. My shift ended at 6 PM that day instead of 5 PM because I had agreed to help, one employee for the evening shift would come in at 6 instead of 5. I asked another employee if she'd be willing to shift lunch hours, because she was going at 1 PM. She said it didn't bother her. So when the manager came to the front to take the money deposits I asked her if I could switch with that other employee, saying that she'd agreed to it. She flat out said no (it didn't change shit who went to eat when as long as there were enough people on the floor...). I asked ""but I'm staying until 6 PM, do you remember? It's going to feel very long"" she said ""I am the boss, I make the schedule"". 

Few hours later the assistant manager came to take my register stating that the manager wanted to see me in her office. I thought ""what again"" and went. She gave me another written warning for ""insulting her"" in front of customers. I said ""I didn't insult you, I asked you a simple question"" and she replied ""You do not get to question my authority or my decision in front of people, I am your boss"". I signed but I was so furious I went to the bathroom and cried out of sheer anger for half an hour. 

When my day ended and I told the story to my boyfriend I cried in his arms for HOURS because I was pissed BEYOND BELIEF that someone would be so mean just for the sake of being mean. He told me ""I know you wanted to keep the job until we move (we were moving to another city 3-4 weeks later) but this isn't worth it"".

So the morning after I came in a bit earlier, went to the back, put my apron on her desk and said ""I quit. Now."" She said ""you can't do that"" and I said ""I can, and I am. Yell 'I am the boss' long enough and you won't have anyone to boss around anymore."" She said ""YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU GOTTA SIGN PAPERS"" (Umbridge, is that you?). I said ""Well get them out of your ass quickly because I'm leaving as soon as my locker is empty"" (we had small lockers and I had a few papers to collect and shit to throw away). 

The paper I had to sign was to certify that I was resigning and whatnot. There was a question asking basically ""why"". I put the pen on that question, looked at her and said ""do I need to?"" ""n-no this question is not mandatory"" ""thought so"". My personal satisfaction is that another employee had left that week so she had to redo the schedule for the 3rd time in 2 days.

She was a downright awful human being and I don't say that about many people. She fired a part time girl because she ""didn't show up to her shifts"" for a week. The girl was in Cuba with her family and had gotten the approval (verbal only, big mistake) from the boss.

Edit 1: she also liked to reschedule people when they would not see it (say you have 2 days off she'd change it when you had those) so people would either show up for nothing or not show up/show up late and she'd give them hell for it.

Edit 2: she also changed my schedule from 40 hours to 15 one week because I said no to working the night shift she made for 2 weeks (I had just finished 2 weeks of doing 5 AM - 2 PM... thought I'd done my share). The irony is that 2 days later we got the letter that I was now to be considered a full time employee (having worked a certain number of weeks for 30+ hours in a row) so she was under obligation to redo the schedule and give me 30h/week minimum.

The thing that killed Tony's chances was partly on him.  Dude was a stat machine, but he cold throw only like 12 picks in a season, but 3 of them were deadly.  He lacked the guy who could get open for him within 5 yards and this had Tony making some questionable throws downfield which here and there lead directly to a loss.  

I think he had some good enough D's, I think he was missing a complimenting WR to his game and not having that guy forced Tony's hand.

&gt; Vampire Weekend is an indie rock band which formed in February 2006 in New York City, New York, United States. The band consists of Ezra Koenig (vocals, guitar), Chris Baio (bass) and Christopher Tomson (drums). Rostam Batmanglij has left the band in early 2016 to begin solo career, but will continue to collaborate with Ezra. The band has released three albums: ""Vampire Weekend"" (2008), ""Contra"" (2010)"", and ""Modern Vampires of the City"" (2013). The band has gained positive comparisons to such artists as Paul Simon, Haircut 100 and The Walkmen.

&gt; Vampire Weekend received much buzz from local blogs throughout 2007 during their rise to a record deal with indie label XL Recordings. Rolling Stone placed Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa at number 57 for the top 100 songs of 2007.

&gt; The band's debut album, ""Vampire Weekend"" was released on January 28. 2008. It was a surprise success, peaking at #17 on the Billboard 200. 

&gt; Their second album ""Contra"" was released on January 12, 2010. It contains the single ""Cousins"". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, only the 12th independently released and distributed album to achieve such a feat.

&gt; They are self-proclaimed ""specialists in the following styles: 'Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa', 'Upper West Side Soweto', 'Campus', and 'Oxford Comma Riddim.'""

&gt; The name ""Vampire Weekend"" comes from a movie that Ezra Koenig made in the summer of his freshman year at college.  You can watch the trailer on Youtube, here.

&gt; Burzum is the black metal solo project of Varg Vikernes (born Kristian Larsson Vikernes, AKA Greven Grishnackh/Count Grishnackh, currently legally named Louis Cachet). Burzum played a vital role, along with other Norwegian black metal bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Emperor and Immortal, in the development of black metal as a musical genre and ideology. In particular, the ambient black metal and depressive black metal subgenres owe much to Burzum's sound.

&gt; From his 1992 debut, Burzum, until his (for the time being) final black metal album, 1996's Filosofem, Burzum went from playing raw, primitive black metal to playing ambient, exclusively synthesizer-based music. His two albums, 1997's Dauði Baldrs and 1999's Hliðskjálf, are purely dark ambient works recorded whilst in prison. However, they do not represent a complete departure from Burzum's previous works, as his albums always contained keyboard elements, and there were keyboard-only pieces on every album except Aske. Throughout his career, Varg has managed to create and maintain a very distinct sound unique to Burzum.

&gt; Despite Norwegian black metal scene being associated with anti-Christianity and anti-religion in general, Burzum's lyrics have been dealing largely with Tolkien world and general mysticism. Varg has totally distanced himself from the satanism usually associated with black metal.

&gt; Due to his imprisonment for several church arsons and the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem, Vikernes has become one of the most notorious figures within the Norwegian black metal scene. Vikernes maintains that he killed Euronymous in an act of self-defense, and denies participation in the burning of three Norwegian stave churches.

&gt; To read what Varg has to say about the origins of Burzum, '92/'93, and his own ideology as well as other matters concerning Burzum and Varg Vikernes, read his series of articles (A Burzum Story) at http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/, provided at the current official Burzum and Varg Vikernes website.

&gt; After 2012's Umskiptar, Varg said he is done with metal and now only produces ambient music albums under Burzum name. Read more on Last.fm.

Never said it was, it's just not under discussion at the moment. 

&gt; Telling someone they can't wear something is the same as telling someone they can't wear anything as far as I am concerned

Well, then you are wrong. Forcing someone to do something is quite different from telling people they cannot *choose* do it. It's all about letting them exercise free choice. Both are forms of human rights but they are still different things. 

&gt; Wearing a veil provides absolutely no protection against crashes. 

It offers ""protection"" against prying eyes for those who feel that way. Who are you to determine the value/validity of that belief? 

&gt; you shouldn't conceal your face any more than is legally required for safety purposes; blowtorches etc.

Why? Who are you to tell me what I can and cannot do? If I want to walk down the high street in a spiderman costume (hiding even more than a burka) then why should the government say I cannot? 

Governments exist to manage our taxes, provide public services and promote the international interests of nations. They are not our rulers.  

&gt; My grandmother never used to cover her hair? 

She sure as hell did. Try and find a pre-WW2 picture of her hatless in a public street. Those who did not wear hat's were called ""hairies"", the insult is still used in Scotland today to describe ""crazy women"". Originally it meant either ""poor"", ""uncivilised"" or ""unkempt"". A muslim woman in a conservative middle east country today would get the exact same response as was once common in the UK. 

Shit, people used to attack you in the USA for wearing a straw hat past a culturally observed date, there were gangs of people roaming around the cities looking for those who did not conform. I think I recall reading the same happening to those who ""wore white past labour day"".

I suspect if you knew more of this sad history then you would be less enthusiastic about your position on legislating clothing. 


&gt; I've never heard of women being culturally inclined to hide their faces. 

That's not the point; if you are going to hate something, at least try to understand it. It's about being ""modest"", some people just take it WAY too far. It's not about ""hiding"" anything, consider an opposite force to those who wear makeup to make themselves stand out. 

&gt; I would bow as is culturally customary. Seems entirely nonsensical to move to another part of the world with an entirely different culture and still maintain a different one. 

That's pretty much a short summary of UK history, particularly the colonial times. Our place in the world was to go to those cultures, burn down all of their temples, steal all of their artifacts then to rebuild the nation in our own image. And you are upset about a Muslim chick wearing a cloth in the UK? For real? 

&gt; From say CCTV you could identify my face? 

There is no law saying that you need to be visible on CCTV. Otherwise hoodies and baseball caps would have been banned long ago. And that's the elephant in the room; these groups cause infinitely more destruction. Where are the people making your points about them? 

The move to deprive Muslims of their face coverings is nothing other than bigotry. People try to rationalise it but the simple fact is that the whole argument is inconsistent. It's claiming to fight a problem that does not exist. ",worldnews

Netflix thoroughly researches the types of shows they THINK people like and they try to emulate those shows. They research to the point where almost all creativity is gone. They use the data metrics off their site to try and guarantee a shows popularity before they even start filming. Example; Pacific Heat and Bojack Horseman exist because Archer, Futurama, and Family Guy are extremely popular shows on Netflix (though I hear Bojack is significantly better in its later seasons) 

Orange is the new Black is, IMHO, their most original and unique show. And I hear Narcos is quite good. Everything else in somewhere in the uncanny valley. Browsing Netflix is like walking though a foreign grocery store. It's like, it's not Doriotos, but it's a triangular corn chip with cheese dust, it's close enough to Doriotos.

2546,"Roadhog does not go out of his way to take damage from teammates either. He does not tempt people more than a genji would. He is just VERY vulnerable when out of position and good players like to abuse that. A good roadhog doesn't even show himself outside of peeking with the hook up, he probably takes less attention than genji even.

Any roadhog that ""goes out of his way to take damage for teammates"" is costing his team the game because that is not how you play him.

Again, 600 HP doesn't matter due to his hitbox and complete lack of defensive mechanisms. A tracer only has 150 HP but you usually have a really low accuracy against her. So she only takes 40 HP damage per second against a soldier, but the same soldier does 180 dps against roadhog because you can't miss him. Your actual time-to-kill against roadhog is not higher than against your average dps or support character, it is just that if you kill him you get rewarded 3 times the ult charge for the same work.",Overwatch

Nick Tahou Hots is a Rochester, New York, restaurant featuring a trademarked dish called the Garbage Plate. The restaurant was founded in 1918 by Alex Tahou, the grandfather of the 21st-century owner (also named Alex Tahou), and named for Nick Tahou, the founder's son, who operated the establishment until his death in 1997. While there are other Upstate New York variants, Nick Tahou's is the originator of the trademarked Garbage Plate.

A nation in NK's position doesn't survive this long by being stupid and not having a plan. The only way for them to survive is to make a military attack on them more consequential than it's worth.

So NK starts developing nukes, the only thing capable of making the US think twice. It puts them in US cross hairs, but Saddam didn't develop nukes and look what it got him. Nukes are the only way to ensure the long term survival of the nation.

You've also got to make it absolutely clear that you're crazy and have your nukes on a hair trigger. You see posessing nukes doesn't make you untouchable; MAD is weak to a technique called 'slicing'. This is where one nation makes very small aggressive moves; a tiny slice of territory here, funding insurgents there, none of which warrant a nuclear response on their own but add up over time. So you make people think you'll launch a nuke at the slightest provocation.

So why doesn't the US sweep in before they've developed ICBMs? Because it would rightly cost them pretty much all of their influence in the area. Because a second Korea war would be immensely damaging to South Korea and surrounding nations, and this war with all its woe would be be undeniably undertaken for the sole benefit of preventing America, and only America, from ever being under any real threat. In response to such a blatantly self serving war, from China to Australia the US would be diplomatically shut out from the region, denying them the opportunity to tranquilise the rise of Asia and ensure continued US hegemony in the future.

If NK actually fires a nuke at the US, they've thrown away the whole reason not to attack them.",worldnews

Your relationship sounds really nice. I am happy you have a nice relationship. Your gf could literally be God and give you Heaven on Earth and you would still be paying in the time you spent with her. You are trading your time and energy for whatever happens with her. She is also trading her time and energy for whatever happens with you. You keep talking about how you're happy to do so - that's the point!!

You keep talking about what you get in return or how sometimes you and her both give to each other...that's completely irrelevant and I've said it so many time already.

I don't know how to be clearer. Here is another example:

In the relationship you and I have, we write comments to each other on the internet. I am paying with my life (about 10 minutes so far) to write to you. Regardless of what I get in return, that 10 minutes is spent. I could've spent it doing absolutely anything else in the world but I spent it here. This applies to you as well, obviously you've spent some time on me as well. (Notice there is not sex involved here).

2705,"I ranked them with a completely non-scientific equation of upside/readiness. 


1. Miro Heiskanen - projected as an elite two way defenseman in the mold of Duncan Keith/ Scott Niedermeyer/ Nick Lidstrom. His skating is amazing and he has great defensive vision. He transitions between zones extremely smoothly and is able to elude forecheckers better than anyone in our system except for maybe Honka. His biggest area of growth is offensive vision - while a good passer and shooter, he gets a bit more hesitant with the puck in the offensive zone and needs to make quicker more precise decisions. Played heavy minutes and put up 10 points as a 17 year old in the SM Liiga, and had great underlying numbers.

2. Julius Honka - I put him as two instead of one only because he'll probably slot behind John Klingberg, but many believe he will be even better. The Klingberg comparisons really end at European, right handed, offensive - minded dman. Where Klingberg uses elite vision to break out and create offense, Julius Honka uses elite skating, speed, and a heavy shot. While he has  great first pass out of the zone and exceptional vision with passing, he is an even bigger threat to escape the zone and open up space using his skating. 

3. Denis Gurianov - Probably the most offensively gifted player in the Stars' system, Gurianov had a tough Draft + 1 year where he was stuck way down on the depth chart of Lada Togliatti, the worst offensive team in the KHL. He still managed to put up a few points playing only a few minutes a night. He transitioned to the AHL last year where he put up 27 points. Those numbers don't pop at first glance, but he was absolutely buried on the 4th line and only started seeing PP and top line minutes in the last few weeks of the season as many other prospects were called up to the NHL. Gurianov has turned into a two-way force, earning time on the PK and in tough defensive minutes. The offense is there and growing, and he projects to have an awesome season in the AHL in the top 6 with skilled, scoring linemates. 

4. Roope Hintz - Drafted in the second round as a kind of 'Faksa-Lite', Hintz exploded on the scene two years ago during the Liiga finals, scoring a few very pretty goals. He went on to have a solid season in the Liiga this year - after missing the beginning of the season with injury, he put up 30 points in 44 games with HIFK, then went on to lead the Liiga in playoff scoring. Hintz has exceptional speed and is a very explosive player, he manufactures offense by creating rushes and opening up space using his skating, and he has a good shot and decent ability to finish in tight. He's a big body and can get in on the forecheck and cause a lot of havoc for defenders. He's also great in his own zone and can be trusted on the PK. 

5. Jason Dickinson - Dickinson was sidelined for the first quarter of last year when the mysterious injury virus hit the whole organization. Because of that, he took a step back offensively after coming back to the AHL, but started coming on strong towards the end, earning a call-up and scoring a nice goal in the NHL along the way. He'll start in the AHL again next year to really get his scoring back, and likely stick in the NHL by the end of the year. He's a big C/RW who has great playmaking ability and hands as well as a good scoring touch, and plays a very good two way game. Think Nick Bonino. 

6. Jake Oettinger - The top rated goaltender in this year's draft, Oettinger had a great year as the starter at Boston University, and basically singlehandedly beat UND in the NCAA tournament. He's big, yet mobile, and plays a very calm, mistake-free game. He doesn't give up big rebounds and doesn't scramble himself out of position. He projects to be a very good starter in the NHL, but that will take 3-5 more years. I put him this high on the list because his upside is tremendous, but goalies are voodoo.

7. John Nyberg - Smooth skating, young defenseman who plays for Frolunda in the SHL. Playing more and more minutes as he gets more experience and should be a big factor in Frolunda's upcoming season. We don't know a ton about him over here, but he's got crazy good vision, skating, and passing, so if he develops correctly he could be big for the Stars in the future.

8. Jason Robertson - Big frame and very good finishing skills in tight. He carried Kingston's offense last year in the OHL, putting up 81 points as really their only offensive threat. His first steps could use some work as he's not super explosive, but once he gets going he's a good skater. He has a great shot and knows how to make space for himself in the offensive zone.

9. Gavin Bayreuther - College FA signing after putting up 29 points in 30 games for St. Lawrence last year, he had 5 points in 15 AHL games in the spring. He's a smooth skating offensive dman who excels at moving the puck in the offensive zone and quarterbacking a powerplay. He should take on top 4 minutes and top PP minutes in the AHL next year and if he can round out his game and polish the offense a little bit, he could turn into a good contributor at the NHL level.

10. Niklas Hansson - Another smooth skating swedish offensive defenseman. In 2015 he was dubbed as one of the Stars' next hidden gems out of Europe, a potential Klingberg-Lite with good offensive instincts and silky moves. He got injured towards the beginning of last season (I think), and lost a lot of minutes when he came back into the lineup, only putting up 11 points in 46 games for HV71 Jonkoping of the SHL. However, he still has a lot of upside and a full healthy season getting 17-20 minutes per night should put him back on track to come over to the NHL in the next year or two.

2754,"I don't really disagree with you, and my personal belief is that any conservative Abrahamic teaching is detrimental to modern society. The problem is that the nationalist/far-right parties often start with rallying people against Islam, but they actually are for conservative Christianity, actual racism, homophobia/misogyny or less democratic political systems. Case in point, FN in France wants to reverse gay marriage rule. A leader of AfD in Germany said ""you don't want Boateng (a Ghana-German footballer) as your neighbor"" and Boateng is *Christian*. Recently Polish right-wing governing party want to make jurisdiction no longer independent from other branches of government. Also, being against Islam does not equal oppressing Muslims for their beliefs. You can prosecute them for what they *do* that is illegal/harmful, but if you discriminate based on belief it's a slippery slope (thoughtcrime). History showed that oppression never ends with one minority.

Edit: one kind of people that I despise most is those who say ""free speech!"" for conservative Christians/nationalists advocating genocide or extreme discrimination, but want to jail any Muslim who preaches similar hate. At least be consistent.

Edit 2: The ""left"" criticize only ""radical Islam"". The ""right"" criticize the entire ""Islam"". I'd say we need to criticize ""conservative Islam"". i.e. try to make Muslims less conservative, prosecute those who are dangerous to the society. I believe in rule of law, and the constitution is the most important law in countries who have it. Any policy must be within the frame of constitution and legal due process.

Edit 3: Some mentions that I am doing ""whataboutism"" when I say ""all conservative Abrahamic"" because I mentioned Jews and Christians which are not part of the topic. Let's think it this way. Almost all terrorist attacks and other Muslim ""problems"" in the west are by Sunnis. By saying ""Islam"", do you also mention Shias and Ahmadiyyas who are also not part of the topic?

What you're talking about here is pretty much the reason why I ended up writing my competitive Overwatch guide a couple of months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5q9tlm/i_accidentally_ended_up_writing_an_introduction/

What later became section 5 actually started out as a reply to someone asking about compositions and meta. The point I was trying to make there was pretty much:

**Don't play heroes you're significantly worse at, just so that your team can adhere to the meta.**

Now, the best way to rise in ranks is probably to get good at a large number of heroes. Doing so both means that you can switch and counter most potential problems your team is having, as well as making it easier for you to identify exactly what the problem(s) is(/are).

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to get into the reason why this is the case, it pretty much boils down to the fact that people in general believe skills transfer to a higher extent than they do between heroes and classes. Yes, aim transfers to a certain extent (not fully though, since different heroes have different shooting and/or movement mechanics), and yes, having played against a hero a lot does give you some understanding of how it's played. However, a large part of getting good at a hero is learning the subtleties, as well as muscle memory, and you only get those by actually playing the hero a lot.",Overwatch

Because he's barely half viable as is. Animation cancels exist for a large portion of the cast to help them actually be playable, hell, animation cancels are what let genji ""one shot"" people at all.

In fact, one of the only two animations junkrat can't cancel is his reload, which is very long and provides more than enough time for a genji to left click-&gt;dash-&gt;180-&gt;right click and that would be more than enough to kill him.

You can also actually utillize genji's kit, particularly his deflect. He can deflect Junkrat's grenades and his mine. Genji's strength comes in getting the jump on his opponents, and aggressively controlling the situation of a 1v1.

**QB- Jameis Winston:** Jameis Winston exceeded expectations in his first two years, becoming the first player in NFL history to throw 4,000+ yards in his first two seasons. It hasn’t been without significant issues with turnovers, however. In 2016, Winston had the 2nd highest number of interceptions among active QB’s, with 18 picks (6 lost fumbles in addition), completing the ball to the defense in 11/16 games (four of which were multi-pick games). It didn’t help that Winston was limited by a sheer lack of weapons, narrow WR depth, and an offensive line who didn’t do him many favors. A lot of these roster deficiencies were addressed this offseason in signing D-Jax,  drafting Howard, and drafting Godwin. As his rapport continues to develop with his existing targets in Evans, Humphries, and Brate, I’m expecting a big leap in year three for him. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 4,353 yards, 61.3% completion percentage, 32 TD’s, 14 INT’s* ",nfl

The visualizer felt like it was almost coming at me and I was moving towards it, it was very enjoyable so I decided to take one more hit. The instant I opened the bathroom door after the hit, time froze and I felt as if I was barrel rolling at light's speed. At the same time I thought I was stuck in that moment of time for eternity, and kind've accepted it. I don't think I snapped out of it until my friend grabbed me and asked if I was alright. Even after I felt as though I was in a disney world for the next ten minutes, I specifically remember thinking the fairy god mother was with me leading me along. After I synced back with reality a little bit I got unbelievably cold and sat in my bed, crying over the thought of my dog that died a year earlier. TL;DR - Salvia was unbelievably beautiful at first, and chillingly depressing afterwards. I wouldn't recommend doing it unless you're in a relatively peaceful state of mind. ",trees

You can see how having this on your phone (with the ability to make music available for when you're offline) or your PC is pretty nifty.

We should audit every state and figure out how deep this goes. 3-5 Million illegal votes seems like a lot but with this single county representing thousands of people over the age of 100, it becomes far less likely to be untrue or impossible. 

Either way it comes down to the fact that we need to audit the voting commissions of each state to check for inaccuracies and discrepancies. It will also give valuable insight into how much Gerrymandering our country is subject to. ",conspiracy

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c8cfa0a250a26a361f26fed40b5aec45.png)  

&gt; Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a Grammy Award-Winning English singer-songwriter from Enfield, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. 

&gt; Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

&gt; Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&amp;R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.

&gt; Adele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an ""essential"" Blue Eyed Soul recording.

&gt; In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.

&gt; The much-anticipated third studio album ""25"" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, ""Hello"", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  

&gt; Grammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for ""Album of The Year"" and ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" for ""25"". and ""Song Of The Year"" and ""Best Pop Solo Performance"" for ""Hello"". Read more on Last.fm.

As if that wasn't enough, they made yet another installment in the series.  ""It will at least be good to atone for Grand Order and the fact they keep rehashing Fate, right?""  Well, A-1 Pictures is producing it.

I don't think I've ever rated anything from A-1 Pictres above a 7.  In fact, they've made a whopping 3 shows I actually enjoyed (Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, and I guess Magi).  A-1 is responsible for the vast majority of shit I just don't like:  SAO, Ao no Exorcist, Fairy Tail, Shineski Yori, Aldnoah Zero (lovely soundtrack though), Asterisk War, Eromanga-sensei, Occultic 9, Qualidea Code, etc.

So all the stars lined up quite nicely.  Fate is being rehashed, r/anime is excited for it, A-1 Pictures is producing it, I wanted to not be let down since I love Fate Zero and rated it 10/10, the poster looks bad, and supreme-waifu Saber was nowhere to be seen.

They are big-boned and massively muscled, with long arms, sloped foreheads, huge square teeth, heavy jaws and coarse black hair. Their broad, flat noses suggest snouts. Sothoryi women are said to be unable to breed with men from Essos or Westeros, only bringing forth stillbirths or malformed offspring.*

&gt; *The Sothoryi mostly known to the corsairs of the neighbouring Basilisk Isles are those who dwell closest to the sea on the Northern shore, who have learned the Trade Talk.

&gt; Counting Crows is an American rock band originating from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1991, the group gained fame in 1993 following the release of their debut album, titled 'August and Everything After', when track ""Mr. Jones"" became a big hit. Known for their melancholic yet melodic songwriting, the band started when singer Adam Duritz (previously of The Himalayans and Sordid Humor) teamed up with guitarist David Bryson (local producer and former member of the band Mr. Dog) in San Francisco, California in 1990. Counting Crows originally performed as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around the cities of Berkeley and San Francisco.

&gt; For the group's first album, Adam and David added bassist Matt Malley, multi-instrument talent Charlie Gillingham, and drummer Steve Bowman.  David Immergluck served as the second guitarist on the first album, but he did not officially join the band until 1999.  Guitarist Dan Vickery was added just as the band set out on their first tour. As stated before, 'August and Everything After' provided the band with a surprise yet very welcome success, garnering them critical praise. Released on September 14, 1993 through Geffen Records, the album hit #2 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, showing that their tunes had tapped into something.

&gt; Counting Crows, with their intimate and confessional yet smooth, often catchy musical approach, achieved a large fan base among melodic rock fans over the years. Their 90s acclaim reflected that a significant music scene looked for something different from the raging guitars of the Seattle-based grunge movement as well as from either boilerplate pop music or the budding electronic music subgenres. The group kept on releasing new songs into the new millennium.

&gt; The band's more recent successes include the 2004 hit song ""Accidentally In Love"", which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack (that has sold over 1,000,000 copies). That song has also garnered nominations for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. That same year, the band released their first ever best of set, which they titled 'Films about Ghosts'. That album features songs from every phase of the Counting Crows' recording career. To date, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. 

&gt; The group made the news when 'Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings' was released on March 25th, 2008. In addition, on January 16, 2008, the band released a digital EP as a free download on their official web site, consisting of the songs ""1492"" and ""When I Dream Of Michelangelo"". The lead single from the album was ""You Can't Count On Me"", which was released for radio play on February 4, 2008.

&gt; The album itself is thematically and stylistically divided into two parts: the first, more rock-influenced Saturday Nights, and the second, more country-influenced Sunday Mornings. Theme changes along with style; in the Sunday Mornings portion of the album, songs become more reflective. The iTunes release contains several bonus tracks, including a track-by-track interview with Duritz.

3304,"I argued at the beginning that this would be necessary at some point.

Eventually 50, then 100.  

Why? Two reasons.

First it cuts down on smurfing--a LOT.  It's one thing to smurf when you can hop in, play a few hours and hit 25, then blast your way up.  It's another to have to go through the *extended* tutorial and game sense modification experience that is qp for several *days* to get to 50 or 100.

Second, the player base is *FAR* more experienced than it used to be.  At launch, you had pretty much two groups: beta players and the metric crapton of new accounts.  Beta players were FAR outnumbered, so the *vast* majority of the population was new to the game.

But in a year, the game has evolved--and competitive and regular players are MUCH more experienced at this game.  Everything from having a good sense of map layouts to understanding various animation cancels, and then things like understanding principles of a good team.

These are all things that mean that a GOLD player today is actually likely BETTER than a GOLD player 1 year ago.

* http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37904703 - Toblerone reduces its size to save costs

* http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/08/anger-over-shrinking-of-terrys-chocolate-orange/ Terrys Chocolate Orange shrinks rather cynically from 175g to 157g (see what they did there?)

Pretty much everything has shrunk because of inflation, and because of industry standard health info on packaging. If a company doesn't want to exceed the RDA for, say, sugar, they have to reduce the size of their product to fall under the threshold.

&gt; As shoppers, it seems we need to better learn to shop using the price per ounce figure.

This is standard in the UK, where the price per kg is displayed on each label in major supermarkets. Is this not the standard in the US? I'd also guess the UK has stricter regulations on when you can call something a ""sale"", which causes people to buy more than they would've when the price has actually not decreased that much.",conspiracy

That's one thing Dansby has that no one can knock him on. Hustle. Dansby's Def. metrics are all also way better as an SS. Errors are garbage (I know you didn't mention them, just to note).

2. Much bigger sample size from Dansby this year than Camargo. Expect Camargo's to drop too the more he plays. He doesn't have any plate discipline, he's not all that fast and his BABIP is high. That's the worst recipe.

3. I agree. I've wanted Dansby in AAA for a week now. Just think it's funny they waited until he came in and went 2-4 and played better than Johan lol. They do this any time before today and it goes unquestioned.

4. You're right, I am being incredibly condescending. It's just frustration from reading every GDT and seeing the exaggeration put into Johan's play so far. Fool me once (Dansby), shame on you. Fool me twice (Camargo?). Well... y'know -- Anywho, I apologize. I will say the initial comment was in jest obviously.

3443,"Because radio is very formulaic now that it is controlled by clear channel aka iheart radio. Also why most genres have died in the mainstream as there is little exposure to new artists. Music on the radio are essentially advertisements for studios vanilla ""artisits"". Or they are decent artists forced to produce something generic for the radio.

This is because radio time is bought by the studios now, and so we then hear the same 7 songs on repeat for like half a year. Radio time among other things to sell their artist is pricey. This much investment means they cant take risks anymore and need a sure thing to turn a profit. Unlike the pre iheart radio years where there was vastly more variety and more artists or artists getting exposure. Also you had to EARN your spot to be on the radio. Criteria being unique and not awful and or amazing. Dj used to for example put something out there, because they acted as your gateway to music and were music heads, and ask listeners opinions of that song.

Tl;dr radio is all about money now. Everything sounds the same because it is. Go on soundcloud or youtube if you want the pre iheartradio experience. Radio time is bought not earned and artisits are peddled on the radio as brands for demographics. They are cookie cutter and sold like cookies, I.e. Products. Radio is no longer a means to expose you to the language of feeling.

Yes, of course, every place is unique. Not sure what's your point. There are plenty of places with as much history and beautiful architecture that get a lot fewer tourists, for various reasons. The hype that's translated into everyone's mind from childhood from all the books and movies is largely overblown, which you realize when you first visit Venice. True, part of that disillusionment is the sheer number of tourists getting in the way. You could say that's just my opinion and of course it is, but I haven't heard a very different one from anyone non-Italian yet.

&gt;If you're not going to acknowledge that you ran your mouth about EU costs at least have the elegance of dropping the topic silently, don't keep hammering on it like you didn't just prove you know nothing about it.

My dig/joke about the German taxpayer clearly got to you, which is funny to watch, but irrelevant to my original point. Which is, I'll remind you: tourism revenue is the only reason 5.5 billion euros ([the price tag on MOSE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSE_Project) after all the cost overruns, including of course the [corruption tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSE_Project#Controversies) we're all so familiar with in the less German parts of the world) is spent to prevent nature from taking its course. All the word-smithing about ""world heritage"" is at the end of the day all about that - tourism revenue. Plenty of world heritage of equal beauty and significance crumples away because there's no money in it. Without tourism, the environmental concerns would win over.

Though the only reasonable answer is, it's an MMO, it has social aspects written in the tag used to describe the genre. Join a good mythic raiding guild that takes socials and hope you get to prove yourself on maybe an alt run, or just ask in guildchat if people want to join you.

Which islands are you even talking about? Name them and let's see if they're more than 3nms away from the Turkish coast in which case article 16 applies.

In addition you claimed

&gt; These islands are within our frontier laid down by the treaty.

So i asked you to point to the exact article that hands over those islands to Turkey. If you just talk out of your ass just say it and don't waste my time.

&gt; From what i know, it did constitute a problem. The important thing here is that they broke the treaty.

No treaty is above the national security of Greece.

&gt; Too few of them compared to the Turkish side. And less important resources.

Doesn't matter. Treaties and human rights don't disappear under a certain density.

&gt; What i am saying is that Greece declares certain zones as their territorial waters and airspace and justifies it by saying it is near their island

All islands have their own territorial waters and airspace not just in Greece but anywhere in the world.

&gt; while disregarding the fact that those zones are either closer to the Turkish mainland, or at an equal distance.

That doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Also you conveniently forgot that those cleansings were started by Greece first, and we agreed because both sides wanted a homogenous population.

What are you talking about, ethnic cleansing is illegal. Greece never agreed to Turkey cleansing the Greeks of Constantinople, Imbros or Tenedos, their rights are secured in the treaty of Lausanne.

I saw someone in one of your posts mention Friends, and I think I'd have an easier time seeing ""predictive programming"" from that show. The whole tone is different. It's characters are actually characters, whereas Seinfeld is full of caricatures.

If goals and general ideology counts, I think a good (and for the future, inevitable) direction to go in is something like this:

Democracy similar to that of Germany (and thus what most democracies are like, at least not something as awful as America's political system) An unconditional basic income that allows living decently, above the poverty line. This compensates for increasing rationalization and the subsequent loss of jobs, it takes away the pressure from working environments, and people have the opportunity to follow their personal interests with much lower possibility for corruption, which allows for better science, art, and public discourse. This would be financed by, among other things, a strong tax progression on income. Not enough to make a high income not worthwhile(so there are still varying degrees if income because I do think that at least for the transition, and probably for a long time beyond that or possibly even forever, we need some capitalist aspects as motivation and because they're easier to implement(i.e. they're necessary)), but certainly more than in any current country on the world. The big challenge to those goals in the current world be that all companies (and subsequently most citizens) would just move to a country with less taxes to make more profit. This only really works with either a very well-educated society that believes in the fundamental good of humanity, or if every country changes to it at approximately the same time. In 1900, I think a system like this is probably impossible to do. In 2025, I think you can get fairly close. In 2200 something like this is probably universal - or I assume we live in a dystopia.

I think Germany has a fairly decent compromise with Hartz 4 right now, and perhaps something like that could be implemented in 1900, to a lesser extent.",anime

Usually pulls are the best for it because there is always the 10 second window when the boss is doing absolutely nothing and you can tunnel dps. 

In multitarget you want to use it when you have the agony extender high as possible (max 35 sec duration). 

You need to plan ahead before using sh to make sure you got reap stacks and 3-4 soul shard ready when it comes off cooldown. 

On mythic progress there are some exceptions when to use it. Top priority add coming up which will rekt the offtank if it doesnt die fast enough? Save SH for that target.

I use SH 100% of the time over sinqularity in progression because the dps difference is minimal and with SH you nuke down prio targets when needed.

If you are running DE talent (execute) then you obviously wanna make sure you have SH available when the target hits the &lt;35% hp range.

My basic opener for single target boss fight with bloodlust in pull:
Prepot 1 sec before pull
Cast corruption

Cast Agony

Use Soul Harvest and The medallion trinket active

Cast UA

3775,"**UGK - Int'l Players (feat. OutKast)**: I was familiar with OutKast, but only really Hey Ya/I Like the Way You Move/Ms. Jackson, then I heard the last song off Girl Talk's second album (#SuburbanWhiteKid) where he samples the end of Andre's verse (Keep your heart, 3 stacks, keep your heart...). I thought the line was great so I googled it to see what song it came from, then I downloaded it. That song is now possibly my favourite of all time and since hearing ATLiens/Aquemini I'd definitely call OK my favourite band. Everything they do is good.

**Kanye West - Stronger**: You could say that this song was my introduction to hip hop in general. I hated rap in seventh grade, then by eighth and ninth grade I tolerated it. I had a buddy in ninth grade who was big into rap and would occasionally send me songs and when this song first came out he sent me the video. It was dope, the Daft Punk sample was crazy. I downloaded the album as soon as it came out and listened to it at least once a day - usually more - for weeks. His sampling was mindblowing for me, my idea of rap was mostly based on music videos, school dances *The Eminem Show* and to me 'rap' was everything from R Kelly to Lil' Jon. I didn't know it could be this melodic and introspective. So I started listening to more rap, and now I'm a hip hop nerd to the fullest. I listened to that album way too much though, and there are only one or two songs off it that I can listen to now without wanting to blow my brains out.

**Lil' Wayne - It's Me Bitches (remix)**: Not the one off the Drought 3. The one with R Kelly on it. The same friend sent me this track during the same summer, and it also contributed to me getting into  rap. I loved the wordplay. ""He's so sweet, make me wanna lick the wrapper / so I let her lick the rapper"" (which he re-used in Lollipop, of course). I though Kells' line ""Makin' her moan, we're having sex to the song / after sex, I beat my chest like I'm King Kong"" was hilarious; I'd listen to the song just to hear that line. Eventually I realized that I'd memorized not only his whole verse, but the whole song, ad-libs and all.

3813,"&gt;I just think the label of genocide is wrong and is politicised to give a bad name to Serbs.

Not quite. I'd be interested if you can give a legal argument as to why Srebrenica doesn't classify as a genocide, but simply saying 'the numbers aren't big enough' doesn't qualify as a legal argument as the convention on genocide doesn't mention a numerical limit in order for something to qualify as a genocide. The key in the whole debate is that the Trial Chamber of the International Court of Justice ruled that genocide as a crime can be localized, and UN documents on criminal law say that 'every member of the group need not be killed in every corner of the globe' in order for a crime to be classified as genocide. What is important is the *mens rea*, or intent, to commit a genocidal crime, which was proven in the Srebrenica trial through evidence of conversations and plans made by Mladic and senior VRS officers around the time the enclave fell. Bosnian Serbs only had that group under their control and under their ability to kill, they didn't have the ability to kill every Bosniak and no one is claiming that genocide was committed in the whole of Bosnia but just in the local region of Srebrenica. To put it in a comparison, if someone said they wanted to exterminate the Croatian population from Zepce, and they drew up a carefully orchestrated plan to carry this out, that could certainly qualify as genocidal even though it would represent less than 1% of the Croat population. Plenty of crimes in Bosnia qualify for the *actus reus* of genocide however they do not have the proven intent required. For example, Goran Jelisic was tried for genocide, and they found he fulfilled the material aspect, though, despite the fact he killed hundreds solely based on their ethnicity, this was not part of a wider intent to exterminate the group in part or in whole and so falls simply under the crime of persecution.",europe

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fde9d0b8306d4289b6c3c59cd95d6b04.png)  

&gt; The Outfield was an arena rock-influenced British pop rock/power pop power trio based in the East End of London, England. Its members were bassist/singer Tony Lewis, guitarist/keyboardist and songwriter John Spinks, and drummer Alan Jackman.  Originally known as the 'Baseball Boys' before singing with Columbia/CBS Records in 1984, the guys were unusual for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the U.S. with new wave hits such as ""All of the Love"" and ""Your Love"" but never reached the album or singles charts in their homeland.

&gt; They began recording during the mid-80s, picking up the name 'Baseball Boys' as a reference from a gang of hooligans from the cult film 'The Warriors'. Changing things around to 'The Outfield', perhaps a hint of their later American success due to their affinity for U.S. culture, they released their first album, titled 'Play Deep', in 1985 through Columbia Records. Picking up critical acclaim for their melodic rock sound, the album reached #9 on the Billboard 200 list and ended up reaching triple platinum status in America. As remarked by an Allmusic reviewer, the band had a knack for making ""a harmonious chorus that is overly smooth and rock savvy."" Their single ""Your Love"" reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #7 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it soon became their 'signature song. It has went on to be featured in a number of 80s-themed compilation albums, and over a thousand covers and remixes by other artists have been released physically and/or online. Other singles ""Say It Isn't So"" and ""Everytime You Cry"" also made it into the top 20 on Mainstream Rock chart.

&gt; Though possibly peaking too early, the band continued to record and tour through the 80s and then into the early 90s as the Anglo-American pop rock and power pop scenes evolved. While their second album, titled 'Bangin'', hit the top 20 on the Billboard 200 list had both singles hit the top 40 on the Mainstream Rock chart, the group began losing their popular audience by their third album, 'Voices of Babylon', came out in 1989. Though receiving critical acclaim, the rock mainstream seemed to have shifted considerably underneath them. Drummer Alan Jackman left, and, now as a duo, they recorded 'Diamond Days' in 1991. After the disappointing response to their 1992 album 'Rockeye', which represented a shift towards progressive rock and arena rock, the group essentially disbanded for much of the 90s.

&gt; They resumed touring in 1998, and thereafter the band released two live albums via their website. The group's comeback album, 'Any Time Now', was released by Sidewinder Records in March 2006 and constituted a comeback to their traditional pop rock sound. In mid-2009, the Outfield entered a London studio to begin recording their seventh studio album. Titled 'Replay', it saw a June 28, 2011 release, with the band's cult following enjoying deliberately retro sounding songs such as ""California Sun"". Their music popping up in various places (from Katy Perry recording a Outfield cover titled ""Use Your Love"" to the 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' video game using their music), the guys had somewhat of a resurgence of interest at the tail end of their career. Although popular interest in the band waxed and waned since their 80s musical heyday, their group maintained a devoted fan base among followers of the power pop genre for many years.

&gt; Guitarist and songwriter John Spinks sadly passed away in July 2014, succumbing to liver cancer after a long and tough battle. He was 60. The group released a statement saying: “We are relieved that his passing was peaceful and painless.” It also remarked that the future of the band appeared ""unclear"". With unreleased songs in the bin, the Outfield may well return in some form. Read more on Last.fm.

3920,"It's honestly so obnoxious how high rank players justify their ego this way. For example, the other day when Seagull said ""git gud"" to a subscriber asking about ELO Hell. Both sides have a bias for their argument. If you are low ranked you don't want to admit that you might belong there. If you are high ranked you don't want to admit that you are there because they want to believe it was their own skill and hard work that put them there. 

Another thing I adore is the people who say hey I made a new account and placed in Bronze, then worked my way all the way up to GM. Don't get me wrong, this is a feat and display of skill. But for every single one you hear about imagine how many have made an alt account, failed to rank up out of ELO Hell, and just stayed hush about it/called it a smurf account/troll account. It wouldn't make sense to complain about it since they have a high account and admitting to ELO Hell discredits their own skill. 

Another analogy that would be able to explain this is people's income. If you are someone who started out with middle class parents and managed to go to college, succeed, then get a well paying job out of the gate and continue to earn promotions to the point of reaching a 6 figure salary you would feel as though you have earned it. However someone who didn't get the opportunity to go to college and instead had to work right out of high school in a minimum wage job and is not making a lot of money later in life would feel stuck. This is similar to ELO Hell. By not being subjected to ELO Hell you get a greater possibility for success. However, if you are stuck in ELO Hell you will find an incredible difficulty escaping it. I say this as a gold player. I have seen several different ELO Hells. I would place them as 1900-2100. 2400-2600. If you escape those hells you are in a comfy position, but if you fall back into them they are incredibly difficult to climb out of. 

What all this sums up to is any player's ego. Players who are low rank will have an ego and feel that they are entitled to being a higher rank than they are. Whether or not they are performing well in their matches they feel stuck in an ELO Hell. Players with a high rank will have an ego as well and want to feel as though they are skillful and that their SR is a display of it.

 As this relates to the subreddit, when we see a post about an ELO Hell two people will chime in. The low rank player who wants a higher rank and has an egotistical reason to believe in it. The high rank has an egotistical reason to deny it. As such whenever one hears the other chime in they feel as though their own skill is being called into question. 

**TL;DR** Both high and low ranking players have a bias towards believing in ELO Hell or not. High rank players believe that they are truly skilled and that their SR is justified by their own skill and hard work. Low rank players believe that they are truly skilled and that their SR is unjustified and that they are stuck in an ELO Hell. This is because all players believe themselves to be high skilled due to their egos.  ",Overwatch

It probably can't hurt, but let me ask you this: if you were one of the best 200 pitchers in the world, and you had already made 10s of millions of dollars in your career, and you were 40 years old, would you really care that you were about 100 lbs overweight? Colon is still pretty effective, and it's not clear that getting washboard abs would actually do anything for him. ",baseball

3995,"I really really liked fury until the ending battle. I really don't like dinging a movie because of historical inaccuracy but that ending was absurd on a lot of levels. Ayer changing that battalion to SS was a Hollywood move because it sounds good to beat them but it completely took me out of the movie. The SS was the most battle hardened and fiercely loyal to the German cause. This wasn't a group of soldiers who have been forced on the front lines like a lot of Germans were at that time, this was the SS. You aren't a soldier in the SS if you haven't earned it. 

So I'll put it this way, if we saw a movie where a a battalion of Marines just throw wave after wave at a tank and get slaughtered in that way most of us would say ""that's ridiculously unrealistic"" and it is. The SS behaving in a moronic way because the plot needed it was really really dumb. That's just tactics too, the true ending with The SS soldier and the main character was worse. I get what Ayer wanted to show us ""hey on the other side they aren't so different than us"" which is true in a lot of cases but not of the SS. The SS ran the concentration camps, a soldier in that battalion does not do that ever. Like ever. 

So I mean again I really really liked that movie until then which just ruined it. It was so absurd to me that i just wasn't even into the movie anymore. Now for people who aren't history buffs which is most people, that ending is fine and I get that. I'm in the minority but from my perspective that ending was flat out silly and dumb",movies

But if you're looking at a film as a way of expressing an idea, or thesis. If you're assuming that the film makers are trying to say something about the world then often the way a movie ends is pretty important and can be seen as the film maker summing up her statement. 

A bad  ending or an ending that seems to fly in the face of what came before can drastically alter the tone. I know that there's a cut of the film Brazil, which ends ""happily"" as opposed to revealing that ending to be fantasy from a man being tortured. Pretty big difference. And while I would still really like aspects of Brazil, I doubt I would like it nearly as much as I do with the grim but oddly funny ending it has.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/a3e5791abc8a4754bed65cd407cc962b.png)  

&gt; Buckethead (Brian Carroll) is an American musician, songwriter and guitar virtuoso, famed for his distinctive stage outfit and elaborate stage shows. He has released over 280 solo studio albums and performed on over 70 more since 1992. He has also made guest appearances on more than 40 different albums by various artists. His music spans such diverse areas as heavy metal, funk, ambient, jazz, electronic, and avant-garde music.

&gt; When performing in his theatrical persona, Buckethead used to wear a KFC bucket (emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker that read “FUNERAL” in black block letters) on his head and a plain white costume mask (commonly found in costume shops and used primarily for dramatic theater productions). More recently, he has switched to a plain white bucket no longer bearing the KFC logo. He also incorporates nunchaku, robot dancing, and toy trading into his stage performances. Buckethead’s persona represents a character who was “raised by chickens” and has made it his “mission in life to alert the world to the ongoing chicken holocaust in fast-food joints around the globe.”

&gt; Although a multi-instrumentalist, Buckethead is best known for his electric guitar playing. He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the “Top 20 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time.”

&gt; Buckethead performs primarily as a solo artist. He has collaborated with a wide variety of high profile artists such as Les Claypool, Tony Williams, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Serj Tankian, Guns N’ Roses, Saul Williams, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, and with Bill Laswell in Praxis. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Last Action Hero.

4417,"I just want to point out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6os1vb/pve_tuning_changes_for_june_25/dkk4pxk/) comment from two days ago.

&gt;Only windwalkers if you wanna say they don't have a single better DPS spec, going ONLY by DPS, but really there are a lot of classes worse off all things considered.

&gt;Feral Druids are still not very good and telling them to play boomkin is basically like telling them to reroll. They want to play a melee spec, not a ranged. Oh and survival hunters because they still exist.

&gt;Then you have DK's/Enhancement shamans who do similar damage to rets, maybe 45k-80k more ST according to WCL Mythic Goroth at Max Percentile, but have far less utility and no immunity, which is obviously super important this tier.

&gt;When you take all that stuff into consideration, rets are actually the 3rd best melee DPS, only to be outdone by warriors and rogues, that both just got nerfed. No good guild cares about a DPS margin that small when you bring so much more to the raid. If it's a choice between a ret vs warrior/rogue (before these nerfs) then yeah okay maybe the ret is benched. Ret vs. any other melee? Ret probably gets the raid spot.

&gt;Source: In a top 60 world 7/9M guild, already been benched for avatar (ret is benched too) and will be for KJ as well (ret won't be benched). Also, our ret was slotted for our mistress progress kill when I wasn't and would have been in for maiden too if he wasn't sick because tanks deaths are a thing on that fight, kings can be helpful, and rets do a ton more damage when they stack their damage CD's with the maiden buffs than most other melee classes.

&gt;TLDR: Ret's aren't really that bad.

&gt;Edit: Forgot about Havoc, but Havoc isn't very good either. They only really shine on maiden because they just hold their burst CD's for when they have the maiden buff and do insane damage. Otherwise their damage generally is lower than most melee and the only thing they have going for them is they can cheese some stuff with netherwalk.

there is no such thing as ""conspiracy"" as a crime. when a statutory crime is commited, conspiracy to commit that crime can be tacked on. meeting with private citizens to discuss getting dirt on one's campaign opponent is not, and was not then, a crime. the emails say nothing about meeting with the russian govt to alter the vote count/tally. 

russia was not classified as a hostile govt last summer, and it is not now, despite the pearl clutching. check the state dept. russia is classifued as an ally. 

unless the campaign received money from the russian govt, the campaign finance laws are not implicated at all. so far the persons involved are (1) a private US citizen, (2) a british music producer, (3) a russian popstar, and (4) a private russian atty, who shows no evidence of even being a serious individual.

as no damaging information regarding clinton and russia was ever released, no leverage was established. the meeting was legal. 

this is released now because of trump and putin's agreement on syria...refusal to look at the big picture is why our democracy died in 1917.

EDIT:Hell, I don't even know what oath you're thinking of as being characteristic of Nazi Germany.  It might be the infamous [Hitler oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_oath), which wasn't a citizenship oath *either*.

Hitler military oath:

&gt;I swear to God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German Empire and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath.

Hitler civil servant oath:

I think when you look at what's happened over the last 2 weeks with the Capitals losing Schmidt, Williams, Winnik, Shattenkirk, Alzner, and Johansson and only getting a 2nd and 3rd back in return....it's pretty depressing asset management.

But if you say that Zen is easily  your best hero, you probably have a decent amount of competitive time on him, so it could look at for example the last 2 or 3 seasons. Not like players are going to completely forget how to play a hero after a couple of months?

It wouldn't be perfect, but it would give  a better chance at getting decent teamcomps, without actually forcing people into roles and I think it would at least be better than the cointoss we have now. At worst it could make sure that no 2 pure mains of 1 hero are in the same team",Overwatch

Meth for my mom. Have explored the world of recreational drugs extensively, so I'm not close minded, but she got hooked bad for a stint. Her lying during that time still lingers in my faith in her sometimes.

Ironically, my dad calling me a drug addict, dissapointment for smoking weed. Also, he's gotten in my face a few time and we've been in a fist fight after he started shoving me one time, then kicked me out for a week while I slept in my car. Did spit in his face while we fought though so a bit deserved. We both are pig headed, intense people with a temper so we tend to clash. 

Honestly could forgive them for everything if they could leave in the past, but after the family.being destroyed, picking up the pieces and then repeating the cycle a few times, it's hard to keep facing the same thing. Hard to change as a person and handle things better when shit keeps coming back up. I definitely had my share of fuckups, but self improvement is the hardest thing I've ever tried. My dad on the other hand doesn't see he needs to change and my mom is too caught up in hatred and pain to take any real steps. She is clean now as far as I know, but hardcore addiction and shitty friends cause lasting effects in other ways for her. She forgot her strength and it's hard to recover from pathological lying. 

To end on a light note, I do love them very much and hope they can individually do what they need to while I do the same so maybe one day we can be a family again. They gave me some of the greatest memories of my life and my childhood was maintained for longer than most kids and I was taken care of well. They had believing in Santa until I was like 12 because we'd put out carrots for the reindeer, then they'd bite them in half while I was asleep. Also, I have the loveliest woman in the world who's far too sweet and good for me. She makes me think I can do it and matches my mind as well as my humor. I have a couple great friends too who took a long while and lot of shit people to find. Never give up for longer than a moment.

4631,"Well, you don't seem to understand double jeopardy.  Double jeopardy prevents you from being tried for the same crime twice (apart from a mistrial) by the same court (meaning same state or feds).  It has nothing to do with private (or even public) employers.

The commissioner's powers are derived from the CBA, which was agreed to by the players through their union.  It's a contract.  The courts can't do anything to change that contract, the change will have to be made in the next CBA.

As to what your employer could do if you were investigated for a crime, that depends on what state you're in and what your contract with them (if you have a contract with them) says they're allowed to do in such a situation.  If you're in Texas, you're in a right to work state meaning an employer could easily punish or even fire you for being accused of a crime as long as you're an at-will employee (most employees in Texas are) and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it in court.

4645,"Random story time. Lived in Saudi for 6 years, made good friends with many people there. One of my best friends from school was from the family of Al-Rashid, who were rivals of the House of Saud. Needless to say, they are *crazy* rich, like royalty rich.

The thing is, they are super liberal, relatively speaking of course. While they didn't eat pork and prayed X amount of times a day like any ordinary Muslim, the dad was divorced and had a crazy hot wife who walked around in a bikini, never seen her with a hijab whenever I came over their house/mansion. They were the ones that actually introduced hiphop to me (this was back in elementary school). They've hosted celebrities on their yacht (they got a group picture of goddamn Sylvester Stallone hanging out in their gym). They're American as American can get. 

They're also intimidatingly intelligent. I remember every time I came over, we'd watch Jeopardy over dinner and I swear any one of them could be a contestant there.

No death is ""certain"" until it happens.  Logically, any situation where you are not yet dead could resolve itself such that you remain alive, since anything is possible.  If your parachute doesn't open, it could turn out that somebody piled up a bunch of mattresses underneath you, or a tornado could sweep through and pull you out of the air and drop you in a lake.  

So when you say ""you're still wrong, you can risk death without it being certain"" you are absolutely correct.  What you're missing is that you **can't** risk death **with** certainty.  There is never certainty until it happens.  You know the line in Anchorman, ""sixty percent of the time, it works every time?""  The reason that is a *joke* is that he is applying certainty to a situation while admitting that the outcome is not at all certain. 

""Risking certain death"" is never correct.",funny

&gt; TRAAMS formed in summer 2011 in the most unsuspectingly quaint surroundings of Chichester, West Sussex. They wrote one huge thunderous song during their first rehearsal that made spires quiver and cobbles wobble, and so Stu, Adam and Leigh decided to do this again every week. It seemed like a more productive pastime than how they first met, at the club night frontman Stu used to run, in what must have been the most exciting place in their hometown at that moment. From those darkened corners sprung forth the noisey, joyous krautrock squall that is TRAAMS. Read more on Last.fm.

4800,"&gt; Zionist is Roman in origin

Lulz. Zionism - as we know it - was the creation of Jewish interests - specifically astounding efforts of one man who was utterly determined to create a Jewish political state and to populate it with Jews. 

His name was Theodor Herzl, and his diaries are a fascinating read.

Herzl died long before his dream could come to fruition, but he had created a critical mass of other Jews - including some of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world - to carry the ""torch"".  

As it turned out, convincing *common European Jews* to abandon their lives and move to Palestine proved to be an extremely difficult task. They were Europeans, and had been for many centuries - they had no desire to move to Palestine.

Nazism served a VERY useful purpose in solving this problem, as it left Jews Europe's Jews with no choice in the matter.

You try hard to shift all attention to ""Catholics"" and ""Jesuits"", and you're tenacious, I'll give you that, but to claim that Zionism was the creation of Catholics?

&gt; Jessica Lea Mayfield (born on August 27, 1989, in Kent, Ohio) is an American singer-songwriter. She first performed with her family bluegrass band One Way Rider at the age of 8. At age 15, Mayfield recorded her first EP White Lies in her brother's bedroom, printing only 100 copies. One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. After an introduction, Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio. A featured vocalist on The Black Keys' Attack and Release, Dan Auerbach returned the favor by producing Mayfield's first studio album, recorded over the course of two years in his home studio.

&gt; Delving into country, folk and soul, With Blasphemy, So Heartfelt is a collaborative project on which Mayfield's sultry voice adds flair to edgy lyrics and melodies. With the help of her brother, bassist David Mayfield, Jessica Lea Mayfield's debut includes cameo appearances by Dr. Dog's Scott McMicken and Frank McElroy on backing vocals.

4957,"&gt; Except it's not fake because there is actually evidence of it.

Ha ha Ha.

&gt; Just about every scientist in every country agrees with it.

Consensus - the hallmark of science. Which part of the scientific method involves everyone clapping like trained seals?

&gt; And why do they agree with it? 

A little thing called grant money.

&gt; Plenty of morons thinking the earth is flat

Well they all agreed so it must be true.

&gt; It doesn't matter if my ""opinion "" is majority or not because it's backed up by empirical evidence.

You keep saying that but the evidence points the other way. Solar activity is the primary cause of climate activity. The entirety of man's emissions are a blip. One volcano produces more greenhouse emissions than man ever has. But you saw a movie about drowning polar bears. So Science! Even if man was to blame the solution would require massive genocide or returning us to a pre-industrial civilization. Which do you prefer?  And considering the massive fraud already uncovered I'm not about to call it settled and donate another wing to Al Gore's mansion. 

&gt; Net neutrality is a huge problem

How can something you admit hasn't happened yet be a huge problem?

&gt;  ""it's fake the liberals are out to get me!! Fake news!!!""

You're the one injecting liberal conservative dichotomy into this. I am neither. Again, sensing your cozy bubble being burst you lash out in fear. Why else the contempt? Why the emotion? 

&gt; So go ahead genius.

Thanks for acknowledging my superior intellect.

&gt; Feel free to tell me why it's no big deal and to counter points made here.

There are no counterpoints to emotional outbursts. Only to laugh and mock. 

&gt; You keep using phrases like ""it hasn't happened yet, I'm sure there are regulations etc"" but let's hear some actual reasoning behind it. 

I've already stated why the net neutrality panic is wrong. If you don't have the reading comprehension that's not on me. Maybe that's why you screech about Alex Jones and liberals. I'm just the boogeyman to you. Is everyone who disagrees with you?

&gt; I don't know anybody who is sacrificing time money or freedom over this.

Says the guy writing huge blocks of text demanding we cough up more tax dollars for more government bureaucracy.

&gt; Unless you consider a few million people donating 20 grand in 2014 to be big money lmao.

You said there was no money involved. Now you're bragging that 20 million dollars has been wasted. Which is it?

&gt; Or TIME to be 10 minutes or less it took to call my congressman.

""Look everybody I called my congressman!"" Obvious virtue signalling is obvious. Please tell us about that time you refuse a promotion so a woman could have it because you're a huge feminist. And then everyone on the train applauded.

&gt; People like you made rational trump voters like me look like a damn joke.

You are neither rational nor a Trump voter. I call bs on both. You've already dug yourself a huge hole with the emotional, incoherent rambling. You also stated something was scientific fact because lots of people believed it. No one believes you're rational. And you seem very reflexive about the liberal thing. I never mentioned politics at all but you've attacked Alex Jones, non-liberals, fake news rhetoric, and so on. It's a defensive posture. You seem like an sjw. And your urge to follow the herd on obvious hoaxes like climate change reinforces that analysis.

What hurts more... that I disagree about the importance of net neutrality or that Hillary lost? ""It was her turn!""",movies

4972,"I don't think you can blame the fuckery in the ME on Christianity. 

Pretty much all the countries involved that aren't Muslim are well identified as ""secular"" countries. So while there may be a ""Christian"" identifying leader in charge, the country itself isn't ""Christian"" by any stretch of the imagination. Muslim countries typically are not secular and so the religion is also predominately the state. Yes, there are exceptions, but as a general rule of thumb there aren't really any ""Christian"" countries. 

Same with the death toll stat, all the countries you are calling ""Christian"" are in fact secular, so you can't blame the religion for their death toll. 


As a complete aside, the ME has been fucked up for a long time prior to the west becoming involved. We certainly haven't helped the situation but that strip of the planet has been butchering each other for  hundreds of years at this point.

Are Andy Serkis and Jason Clarke strong enough to lead a 180 million dollar movie? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes suggests yes. How about the fact that The Jungle Book was carried by a child (any celebrities were just voicework). 

Here's the problem, it's these actors, in this movie. Now I'm not familiar with the source material, but the trailers give me the impression that these two are like the best mercenaries in the business, and I just don't believe it. They're too young to have the experience/wisdom of anyone else, too cocky to want it more than anyone else, and frankly to small to be a physical threat. Everything that I saw highlighted that these two were super experienced, but they were also getting out of conflict by the skin of their teeth. 

I think this would have worked better if they were played up as *inexperienced*, who manage to overcome great odds. I don't blame the actors for the director's decision to cast them as super soldiers, and I know that's where my negative opinion of the film came from based on the trailers. 

That, and it just looked cheap. I know the consensus seems to be that the CGI is incredible, but it just... isn't. Just about every blockbuster this year has had more convincing special effects. 

But I don't think any of that explains why this one failed with general audiences. For them, there was no hook. Besson? No. Just. No. Where is the story, what is this world *about*? The most successful films with GA make you care about what's going on in the story in a 2 minute trailer, so you're interested to see the whole thing.

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

I believe the minimum is around 60% haste possible slightly less if the stars align. The closer to the boss you are the less haste you need. It also depends on some other stuff like the bosses model size and if you run towards the boss during the combo so practice makes perfect. To do it with minimal haste you want to run forward during the combo, blink directly towards the boss, and cast the second ice lance from basically on top of the boss so it has minimum travel time.

You can use this weakaura to see if you hit the double or not so if you're willing to spend a little time practicing on different bosses and target dummies you'll get a good feel for it. https://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=3917

In truth though it's pretty unusual that it's worth doing - it's still a dps increase but it's not a huge one anymore. In general I'd reccomend saving your shimmer charges to deal with mechanics. You'll often gain the dps back by having shimmer so you don't interrupt your rotation to deal with mechanics.

edit: for what it's worth you can go flurry -&gt; shimmer -&gt; ice lance -&gt; ice lance. The order makes no difference it just matters where you are when you cast the flurry compared to where you are when you cast the second ice lance.

Because I would challenge the notion that them turning Craster's babies into WW is inherently contradictory to them wanting to become human again/die. Why? Because they are also *practical beings*. They're intelligent. They organize. The reason they are turning babies into wights/walkers, is because they need stock to their armies. The destruction of Westeros, as well as dying in peace, is just a long term end goal for them. In order to get there, they need to strengthen their position as much as possible, even if it means doing unto others what was done unto them.

All goes well and we clear mythic EN. When Nighthold mythic started our two raid leaders decide to take a break from the game. We still had about 4 other officers but none of them were really capable of leading a 20 man team. So we stick a bit to heroic raiding.

I create a website for them, then start making spreadsheets for tracking our performance per member, host a team speak server, which eventually went to Discord because its way better. Set up the complete Discord server. So after a while they ask my IRL friend and me to become officer and lead our team to some mythic kills again. 
So we eventually get to 7/10 mythic, to our lovely strarbro. 

Then out of the blue my IRL friend starts spreading rumours about me wanting to realm transfer because our guild would never be able to 10/10 Night hold. In 1 night the guild owner demotes me to social. I try to get an explanation for what is happening but I don't get any answers and I should just deal with it. I left the guild the next day. It felt like all of the work I had done was destroyed over one night.

5276,"Look, what I am saying is not that it was inappropriate to call the police, but that it is inappropriate to criminalize someone over throwing a piece of food.  It's fine to call the police if someone throws something at you from a car.  You want that person identified and stopped from doing that.  But, do you really want that person charged with assault and given a criminal record over throwing a piece of food?  Do you really want the court to spend its time and resources on that?  When you weren't even harmed in the slightest?

Personally, I would want a consequence that ensured that the person didn't do it again, but didn't ruin their life over something so trivial.  What such a consequence was would obviously depend on the circumstances and context.  Perhaps being arrested would be frightening enough to scare someone into not doing such a thing again, in which case an apology might be appropriate.  If there is doubt as to that, perhaps community service or a similar consequences would be appropriate - I know the Crown is empowered to make all sorts of deals, sometimes without requiring a guilty plea and therefore a criminal record.  If there is some other issue, such as mental health, that led to it, then I'd just be happy with an apology and them getting the help they need.

I think what we have to remember here is that although the charge is assault, no one was actually harmed.  What we are talking about is someone throwing a piece of pizza.  Even if it had hit, it wouldn't have hurt anyone.  At worst, it would have soiled his clothing.  Why do you want to wreck someone's life over this?",canada

&gt; William Onyeabor (Enugu, Nigeria, 29 March 1946 – 16 January 2017) was a Nigerian afro-funk, musician, singer and songwriter.

&gt; Onyeabor's songs are often heavily rhythmic and synthesized, occasionally epic in scope, with lyrics decrying war and sung by both Onyeabor himself and female backing vocalists. In recent years a number of his songs have appeared on various compilations, most often his biggest hit, ""Better Change Your Mind"", which has appeared on Africa 100, World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing - The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa, and Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos, through labels such as Luaka Bop.

&gt; Some biographies claim that he studied cinematography in Russia, returning to Nigeria in the 1970s to start his own Wilfilms music label and to set up a recording and production studio. He was later crowned a High Chief in Enugu, where he still lives as a businessman working on government contracts and running his own flour mill. According to the Luaka Bop record label, Onyeabor ""self-released eight albums between 1977 and 1985 and then became a born-again Christian, refusing to ever speak about himself or his music again."" The label reports that through attempting to speak with Onyeabor himself, and by talking to people who seem to have firsthand knowledge, it has been trying to construct an accurate biography of him for the past 18 months, without success.

&gt; In 2014, the music website Noisey, affiliated to Vice magazine, released a 31-minute documentary entitled Fantastic Man that documents Onyeabor's history and legacy as well as Noisey's attempt to track him down for an interview. 2014 also saw a touring supergroup called the Atomic Bomb! Band come together to play Onyeabor's music at a series of concerts and festivals around the world. The group includes David Byrne (of Talking Heads) and Money Mark (of the Beastie Boys).

&gt; In December 2014, William Onyeabor made his first radio appearance on the Lauren Laverne Show on BBC 6 Music, where he stated ""I only create music that will help the world,"" whilst also admitting that he has never played live, and announcing that he had plans to release new material.

&gt; William Onyeabor died aged 72, peacefully, on January 16, 2017.

Studies show brain differences between transgender and cisgender men. Transgender ones have brains that are closer to females. Again. Gender dysphoria is a real thing. It's not just people who think they are the opposite gender deluding themselves.

5299,"&gt;you are insiting on ignoring what falsification actually means.

Actually it is you who is ignoring what it actually means.

     Falsifiability or refutability is the logical possibility that an assertion can be contradicted by an observation or 
     the outcome of a physical experiment. That something is ""falsifiable"" does not mean it is false; rather, that if  
     it is false, then some observation or experiment will produce a reproducible result that is in conflict with it.

People do not rise from the dead. It has been observed that no one ever has. Your theory, claim, hypothesis what have you, is falsified. 

&gt;You don't try to prove a hypothesis right. You try to prove them wrong. 

No one has ever risen from the dead after three days. You need to show proof that YOU are making a valid claim. You cannot.  Like I asked, and you ignored, what about all those other ""gods"" who ""rose"" from the dead? Are you saying they exist and are true because they are not falsified? Hmmmm?

Are you being purposefully obtuse or are you illiterate?

I'll state it again, and bold it this time:

**""The interrogation of a youth detained without access to counsel, to elicit statements about serious criminal charges while knowing that the youth had been subjected to sleep deprivation and while knowing that the fruits of the interrogations would be shared with the prosecutors, offends the most basic Canadian standards about the treatment of detained youth suspects.""**

His charter rights were violated in an *offensive way* according to the SCC. The highest court of the land was *offended* by the actions of the government. You don't think someone's Charter rights being violated is harm?

&gt;The fact he supported, engaged in terrorism and worked for a terrorist organization.

Watching them ripping each others appart over some [""pun""](http://i.imgur.com/3HJC62g.jpg) in the internet really cracked me up. In comparisson I'm liking Kadota a heck lot more than when he was introduced, his backstory along with Chitose baba caring for his health make both a more complete set of side characters.

I like [sassy Erika](http://i.imgur.com/dNdguF4.jpg) any day of the week, but I didn't find it that nice of her to be a total jerk towards the girls whom did nothing wrong to deserve her rude behaviour. I wonder if by the end of the series we'll get real acknowledgement of Takamiya being her father.

5436,"Ok lets take a look at this article you provided

&gt;Women who are virgins when they marry are less likely to divorce within five years than those who have multiple partners before marriage. Next least likely to divorce are those who had one premarital partner.

Ok exactly what i've been saying

&gt;Women who had two sex partners prior to marriage have consistently had higher divorce rates within five years even than those with higher numbers of partners. People with two premarital partners are more likely to divorce than those with three to nine. Only recently has the divorce rate been highest among women with 10 or more premarital partners than among those who had two.

&gt;But the difference is so slight it's not statistically significant

The difference between two and 10+ is not statistically significant which was surprising to the researcher. Not disputing that and he even gives an explanation, which I also hypothesized earlier in this comment thread. 

This is NOT saying there is no statistical difference between those with 3, 4, 5 to 10+. Only that 2 and 10+ are statistically similar in this study.  

&gt;He theorized it's the case of the one who got away. Presumably, the woman married one of her two premarital partners, but the other creates ""an over-emphasized comparison. It's like in historical romance novels where the woman is agonizing between two suitors. That second one is a viable option.""

50% chance that the guy you married is the worst person you've had sex with. 

&gt;Other research has shown that premarital sex impacts marital quality.

&gt;""Our findings were quite in line with what (Wolfinger's) study found. The number of sexual partners someone had had before marriage was associated with marital quality and a higher number is associated with lower quality across the first two years,"" said Galena K. Rhoades, 

Exactly what I've been saying.

&gt; Caucasian and black women were similar in terms of their sexual behaviors prior to marriage. Hispanics and ""others"" had ""notably fewer"" sex partners and also lower divorce rates than whites or blacks. 

Hispanics and Asains have lower sexual parners and lower divorce rates. 

&gt;Since 2000, one-third of marriages involving women who had 10 or more premarital partners end in divorce within five years, the report said, but Wolfinger added a caveat. ""This is the result most readers of this brief expected: A lot of partners mean a lot of baggage, which makes a stable marriage less tenable. It's also entirely likely that the correlation is spurious, the product of certain personal characteristics. For example, people who suffered childhood sexual abuse are more likely to have extensive sexual histories,"" he wrote. ""Childhood abuse also increases the odds of a problematic marriage.""

Pretty much in line with what i've been saying. You can't say that hooking up with 10 people is the reason for higher marriage failures, but the fact is 10+ is shown to have the highest divorce rates. Whether that be because of religious factors, morals, sexual abuse it doesn't matter.

If you are unable to complete it at all, identify the problems. If there are particularly nasty trash packs you cannot seem to get through (HoV comes to mind), consider running comps with reliable CC. Mages and rogues are particularly useful in this endeavor, as polymorphing and sapping one mob in a crowd can easily be the difference between moving on, or wiping there. 
If you are not able to progress past specific bosses, once again, identify the problems. Are important casts going off? Bring groups who can interrupt. Are you running into enrage timers? Bring better DPS. Are you unable to heal through certain mechanics? Bring groups who know fights and can avoid unnecessary damage. 

If you are simply unable to beat the dungeon under time, keep three things in mind. If you are losing time to deaths, chances are the tank cannot hold aggro, or you can't keep his HP up. Both are consequences of affixes (Skittish, bursting...) that are nasty, and target healers and tanks more than DPS. If you aren't dying often but are just moving slowly, then you can solve it in two ways. More confident tanks, or slightly easier to find, better DPS. Aim for 750k+ DPS when forming groups, regardless of item level (within reason). I've cleared a 12+ with about that DPS and we had a little breathing time. Lastly, different dungeons have differently levels of difficulty. Attempting to beat a 9+ MoS, or VoW, will be much easier than Upper Kara or HoV (in my opinion). Don't take it personally and try to remain upbeat if you don't beat the timer -- the specific dungeon + affix combo can be very nasty!  ",wow

They wanted to play against each other, find out who's the best player, the best team and do it with their own rules.

People knew eachother, played with eachother, looked up to eachother and other people looked up to them. I was part of such a community back then, albeit in a rather small game, but it lead to me having to play competitive games ever since, otherwise gaming would just not be fun. That is still the case, although money is indeed involved in the whole thing since esports gained mainstream traction, but it's still the purest form of competition out there. It's not about making money with it, although I'd like to if I was good enough, but I have other obligations in life. It's about there being something that isn't just the ladder which is flawed in itself. I want to be part of a team that plays against other teams to find out who is better and I want to watch other teams do that as well. Ladder, while being high up there is a good goal to have, shouldn't be the highest thing you can accomplish because it's flawed. The purest and most fun form of competitive Overwatch is teams that have been together for months or years playing against eachother in front of spectators, and that's what it means to have an esports scene.

Like cersi said, there is food in high garden. Also while surrounded by enemies none of them are going on the offensive soon. So they will attack high garden for supplies. Then possibly deal with dorne somehow. Then there will be 4 major sides. Danny, lanisters, the north, and the walkers.   
The north is too preoccupied with the walkers to do anything against cersi so really the lanisters only have to fight danny and if they do so after defeating high garden and dorne then it should be a decent fight considering they will be well supplied and rich off loot.   
I have full confidence that the lanisters will attack high garden and win. It would be bad story telling for the lanister army to be defeated by attrition and lack of morale. Considering cersi and Jamie both mention needing a victory to boost morale and allies, and also supplies that high garden has. It just seems like a certainty.   
Danny didnt bring 3 dragons, the unsullied, and a horde all the way across the ocean to defeat a shadow of what the lanisters army used to be. No. They will become stronger than ever and itll be a big battle.

Gibbs and Wilshere being overrated doesn't say anything about or team because it's all mutually exclusive. If your argument is that a youth player should be rated by ge amount of senior appearances he makes for he team that found him, then I implore you to consider how much it means to win titles. Nathan Ake and Bertrand Traore were just sold for 30m, after being signed at a relatively young age, when they were just about unknown, you call that profiteering, I call that successfully developing two youth prospects into senior players. 

Also, I like how you consider Terry, Huth, and Carlton Cole ""players from 20 years ago"" when each of them made their senior debuts under Reiner around 2002, the same time fabregas made his Arsenal debut, and only five years before Gibbs and Wilshere made theirs. 

PS; ""the current generation"" of youth prospects only just started like a year or two ago, and at this point in time, Chelsea's looks better ",soccer

Circumstantial evidence is just as relevant as non-circumstantial evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The distinction only matters to armchair attorneys who watch too much Law &amp; Order.

Additionally, an email about a meeting and its contents and an admission that the meeting took place is direct evidence (not circumstantial) of a meeting about such information.

&gt; Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in Pinner, Middlesex, England on 25 March 1947) is an immensely popular English singer, composer (mostly with lyricist Bernie Taupin) and pianist. In a career spanning five decades, Elton John has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, "" Candle In The Wind 1997,"" remains the world's biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time.

&gt; In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&amp;B musicians like The Isley Brothers, Major Lance, Billy Stewart, Doris Troy and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club.

&gt; John was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U.S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll. 

&gt; Key musical elements in John's success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin, his rich tenor and gospel-chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat ""flashy"" outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage.

&gt; John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998.  He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s.  In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked John #49 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.  He continues to be a major public figure. Read more on Last.fm.

The point of me bringing up Tyler Perry was to show that a movie that is essentially ONLY for black audiences can still easily earn $50-$70million. And movies with black casts or telling stories with black interest can make even more...hiddden figures, girls trip, get out.

We just knew that not every person took on the traits of their sex.

But now, we've ""decided"" that gender is a ""spectrum"" just to make everyone (and by that I mean the fraction of a percentage of the people who feel this way) feel better. 

It's a silly example, but the dumb Bill Nye show example is great. 20+ years ago he on his show says with no uncertainty ""there are two genders..."" But now, in 2017 the same guy on his new show says ""gender is a spectrum.""

We've just changed how ""we"" define the same word. But nothing actually changed.

&gt; Peter Gabriel (born Peter Brian Gabriel on 13 February 1950) is an internationally-famous award-winning English singer, musician, and songwriter who rose to fame as the lead vocalist and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career. His 1986 album, So, is his most commercially successful, and the album's biggest hit, ""Sledgehammer"", won a record nine at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. Throughout his career Gabriel has won numerous music awards, including three Brit Awards (winning Best British Male in 1987), six Grammy Awards, and thirteen MTV Video Music Awards. In 2007 he was honoured as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his “influence on generations of music makers”. In 2009 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize and, in 2010, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis.

&gt; Gabriel founded Genesis in 1967 with fellow Charterhouse School pupils Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford, and drummer Chris Stewart. After leaving Genesis, Gabriel began to experiment with various elements of world music as the underpinning for his dense, poetic lyrics. Although he released a series of successful song-oriented albums, Peter Gabriel 1, 2, 3, and 4 (aka Car, Scratch, Melt, and Security) and chart success in the UK with the top 5 single Games Without Frontiers his commercially strongest period began in 1986 with his now seminal album So and its slightly less successful counterpart Us. After this came a 10 year hiatus until the album Up came out.  This was followed by the ground breaking Growing Up tour. There was a DVD released of this tour.  His 2010 studio album is Scratch My Back. 

&gt; Gabriel has composed and recorded soundtracks for films as diverse as Birdy (which contained re-purposed snippets of his studio albums to date), Passion: Music from The Last Temptation of Christ, and Rabbit Proof Fence. He also sang the Randy Newman composed title song to Babe: Pig in the City called That'll Do. He recently contributed to the wall-e soundtrack, singing the end title song Down to Earth, and composing two other tracks.

&gt; He created one of the more innovative videos of its time for the song Sledgehammer, with the then-fledgling Aardman Animations studio.

&gt; He was also instrumental in founding the long-running festival organization WOMAD (World Of Music Art and Dance), and participated in the UK millennium celebration, for which he wrote the musical OVO. The recording studio he built, Real World, and the record label it spawned, have brought many artists from around the world to the attention of Western ears.

&gt; Gabriel also wrote the music for The Millennium Show which was performed throughout the year 2000 in The Millennium Dome.  The arena where The Millennium Show was performed is now the O2 Arena.

&gt; Rumors of reunion with his former band Genesis have persisted, with conflicting information that changes almost daily, although he has confirmed he will not play a part in Genesis' reunion tour. [note: the reunion WAS in rehearsals when Gabriel decided not to do it because he felt like he wasn't having enough input.] Read more on Last.fm.

5749,"First of all, if I may address one thing. 

&gt; I really wanna go back to thinking earth is a globe

I would be careful of defining your beliefs in terms of labels such as that.  I don't think that you should want to believe anything other than what makes the most sense to you at the time. Right now, you're on the fence about what you believe because you don't know what makes the most sense.  What i'm trying to do is provide more data to you in favor of one side, so that you have more information to broaden your perspective.  In other words, we can only judge the validity of things based on our current scope of what we understand.  But when we get more information, suddenly that perspective increases, and things that made sense to you in the past, suddenly don't anymore, because you can see a bigger picture now, where before you couldn't.  To put it into another metaphor, your circle of understanding gets wider, thus illuminating things previously unseen.  Just believe what makes sense to you given the information you have at the time.

Now to address the airplane statements.

&gt; What bothers me is that pilots don't have to take the Coriolis effect

Basically the same thing for a bullet.  Extremely minuscule effects, which, given that an airplane is being piloted, the pilot compensates for.  In other words, ""We're being knocked 10ft right of our destination due to the Earth's rotation, well just turn the plane 10ft back on course capn!""  ezpz.

&gt;  During the flight, you need to get up to use the restroo....

I mean, this is just one persons comment on an internet question board.  not really a beacon of immutable knowledge or anything.  Should probably gather a much larger database of opinions and information before throwing your weight behind a belief.

This is the thing about the coriolis effect.  Its extremely small.  Like very very subtle.  The reason its such a huge deal with long range shooting though, is because you have an extraordinarily small margin of error in making a long range shot.  So every tiny little calculation you can make to optimize your bullet's flight trajectory is a huge boon to you.  With flight of commercial airliners and bath, shower, and sink drain rotations, the Coriolis effect isn't really strong enough to illicit a reaction of any sort.  its just very insignificant.

You cited a seriously heavyweight paper and used to it support a statement that the authors themselves don't make. 

Not that there isn't a breakdown of cells, otherwise there isn't damage occuring at all, that's literally what damage is... cells breaking down. 

&gt;The energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a process called electron transport. This generates potential energy in the form of a pH gradient and an electrical potential across this membrane. 

... yes. 

&gt;With the earlier definition provided one could say it's a receptor problem.

Are you just trying to say that cells let things in and out, when people are sick, bad things get into cells and kill them?

Things bind to receptors, this opens channels. Sometimes things bind to channels to close channels. Sometimes channels just don't give a fuck about receptors. There's such an absurd number and variety of receptors that saying 'it's a receptor problem' without specifying which receptors is about the same as shrugging and saying ""Eh, life right?"". *Of course receptors are involved*. Maybe I'm missing the point your trying to make here?

&gt;Oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS in short) is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy which is used to reform ATP. In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.

Yes. 

But that's not really the point I assume you're trying to get at. Oxidative pathways exist in cells (otherwise why breathe it in?) but problems only happen when you encounter oxidative stress: reactive oxygen species become to prevalent and (as it turns out) reactive oxygen is fucking toxic. Too much reactive oxygen and your DNA comes under attack, cells die etc. Sometimes damage mitachondria start generating reactive oxygen themselves, which just makes the problem worse. 

But that doesn't make it all bad. Your body both uses and protects against the effects of reactive oxygen, it's when those mechanisms are overwhelmed, malfunction or fail that you really run into problems (like neurodegenerative diseases). 

What does this have to do with the entire medical establishment being wrong?

A bit off topic, but still kind of relevant as an analogy, I'm a HS teacher myself and there's a reason there's such a low teacher retention rate, especially at poorer schools. A lot of well intentioned (and often pretty good) teachers volunteer to work for lower performing schools thinking that they can make a difference. Many of them soon find out that having an awesome lesson on Newton's Laws won't engage a student if they barely got any sleep or food the previous night and got high before class (assuming they decided to go to class at all). Not to mention how the administrations at those schools will often limit anything creative or innovative a teacher might try to do. There's only so much one person can do against systemic issues.

5844,"I actually happen to be a programmer. While I do not work for Valve, I have many years experience. The problem is not with the game's code so much. I will do my best to provide some insight.

WALLS: The game has to send the data to your computer when someone is on the other side of a wall. Otherwise, wallbangs, footstep sounds, etc. wouldn't be possible. A ""wall"" obviously isnt a real wall, but rather an image of a wall. Your eyes care, but the computer does not. Think of Photoshop and layers. If a layer below the layer you are on is covered, you cannot see it, but the computer knows it's there. The only way to stop this, or even prevent it, would be to encrypt and/or obfuscate the memory address pointers in the game. This is possible to do, whether valve did automated tiny updates every 10 mins, at the start of every match, etc. However, this goes beyond the scope of many programmers and is not nearly as easy to do as it is to say. 

WALLS tl;dr: Could be prevented, wouldn't need reprogrammed, would need smarter programmers.

Aim / Trigger Bot: This is next to impossible to stop from a programmers standpoint. Again, changing the memory address pointers would be the only way so the bot wouldn't be able to know what to aim at. And even then, pixel differences, etc could still be made. The problem with these is there not so much a ""hack"" into the game, but automation of user input. 

So what CAN be done, and how do 3rd party sites do it? Well of course none of us know for sure, but I would imagine first off they do signature scanning. They simply go to the major cheat providers, buy the cheat, know its signature, and detect it. Not very high level, but does the job. Second, and perhaps more ""invasive"" is it looks at memory and api calls. A far cry from looking at your browser history for example. For example: WriteProcessMemory is a common windows API used to modify the memory and thus the game. Anticheats can ""hook"" this api, so that when it's called, if it's target is the game, it's blocked / detected. A challenge here for programmers is that some things such as Antivirus could produce false positives.

What would be best, in my opinion, is do what the Governments do when they catch hackers. Hire them. Hire the people who are making these cheats, who know the exploits well, and use them as defense. Also, instant ban and/or shadow ban them. No more of this play for hundreds if not thousands of hours, eventually get a ban someday.

5921,"I agree that if race isn't especially important to a character then it really doesn't matter what race the actor is, hence I thought having a black Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a fine casting choice. However, it would have been ludicrous in the extreme to cast a black actress in that role only to white her up, since there are plenty of capable white actresses. The exact same logic applies to black face. So, in a sense I agree, in that for most roles it doesn't, or ought not matter what race the actor is, but blacking a white actor up or whiting a black actor up is unnecessary and therefore inappropriate in all but a few niche roles, such as Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder. Black face only works in very carefully thought out satires like that. Another example is Jonah from Tonga.",AskReddit
5922,"I've been thinking about this lately and quite frankly I would disagree. 
While it is true that Polish people do not like when foreign governments and organisations meddle in our internal affairs I am not so sure if people would only blame the EU for sanctions. 

For most of people in Poland, EU is this enigmatic structure that they don't really know much about. I would argue, that if you asked an average Pole, they wouldn't know the difference between European Commission, parliament and council. So when the sanctions hit and the EU money stops flowing, will the people really point the fingers at some organization they know so little of? Or will they point them at the faces they see everyday on TV and whose decisions have a much bigger impact on their day-to-day affairs? When Polish farmers lose access to EU funds, will they fly to Brussels to show their discontent, or setup barricades in Warsaw? And when EU investment slows down and it results in an economic downturn, will people connect it to sanctions, or will they blame the government that has promised them prosperity?

I don't deny here that some people in Poland will hate the EU for that. But I wouldn't discount the effect it would have on the government. If PiS is unable to sell to the public,the idea that sanctions are not their fault they will get hit the most. And lately, they have trouble explaining anything to the public.

Flower power was a slogan used during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a symbol of passive resistance and non-violence ideology. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children.

The concept was beautiful in its simplistic perverted perfection. It took a well-known mythos and presented an obvious-in-retrospect way to perv it up to the nth degree with minimal guilt.

With few exceptions, the main characters were no longer stripping *the enemies*, they were stripping innocent people who were merely being controlled. The whole concept suddenly felt very contrived and full of non-sequiturs, like they were determined to NOT use the original concept but still find some excuse to strip people.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*!

6096,"&gt; but this is only a result of the poverty countries like France have created

""Sustained"", not ""created"". Africa wasn't richer before colonialism.

Overpopulation is actually mostly a result of western medicine knowledge being exported to Africa and financial aid during drought and similar things. Fertility rates have dropped, not increased. The population grows because people on average live considerably longer, while still being very poor.  

The west does not have an interest in keeping Africa poor because if people have no future in Africa and know that life in the west is much better, they'll simply come here. Economically we benefit from cheap raw resources from Africa (which we can then process and sell back to them at much higher prices) but it's faulty, unsustainable economics if conditions in Africa do not improve.

6116,"We will then address value and the value of meaning. It's the common argument: the movie wasn't ""good"" in my eyes so why should I care? Whatever if it's deep, it was shit. 

First, that is something I seriously don't understand. There are movies I didn't like but I am up for anyone bringing life into something that was dead to me ...

Anyway, that common assumption is to say that meaningfulness is not meaningful. That meaningfulness is secondary to preconceptions about the form of the art. That the form is more important than the substance and that the form obstructs the substance (which is already all so subjective and a definition of art). But the form is also valued, and everything that is valued is done so because of its inherent meaning. People may find comfort in a certain type of structures, those structures means something to them, may that be processed consciously or not. So it makes no sense separating meaning from anything, all is meaning, saying something can be meaningful and bad is wrong, it's just valuing some meaning higher than others. 

&gt; For what? References to things which I could actually read and learn from in the time it would take to appreciate BvS.

Now you are depreciating the use of the cinematic medium in this film. This film relies on subjectivity and therefore discovery, you have to look for things. All the movie has done and why I write those things is presenting those elements in a creative form that made me want to look for more. Reading about fertility and castration is not the same as seeing it, one is way more primal, less subjugated to reason. But the process is to understand, and understanding comes from abstract presentation to concrete. 

What the movie does is what Campbell did. Comparative mythology. Showing the links between all those myths. To show they are eternal. I don't remember another work which has done the same, to such an extent. 

Like all mythology, it takes back an existing pattern and model it to fit modern time. Hence the ""creative form"". Those are not references, they are not applied to the letter, they are digested, transformed. 

Which means the movie is meta gain. It says to us Superman is a mythological being that is relatable to older mythological being (Lex made it even clear when the list names of different Sun figure throughout history) and the movie is a mythological tale that reenacts older mythological tale. This meta aspect is pure form and substance as one. 

Same thing for say (they are many but one of my favorite): symbolism. Superman is a living symbol, a mythological being, a fantasy. Impact on Bruce and Lex: blurs the light between dreams and reality, fantasy and concrete. So the inside is out. What does the movie do: use a lot of symbolism. Symbolism is basically inside out, it's the relation of psychological processes (and complex) to the outside world. Then the viewer is transported into a movie that is realistic but imbued with a dream like logic. The viewer finds himself in the same place as the characters, the movie looks for confusion (which we never see in blockbusters as they all spoon feed you). This is a meta on symbolism and a perfect use of symbolism. Symbolism is a unique tool for the cinematic medium, it takes its root in the very magical act of the ""vision"", something that can only be translated by graphical art, and in movement by cinema or animation. 

Even more, the film reverses the trope of the Cycle of Age found in Excalibur. Superman brings the dawn of a new Mythological Age. Therefore the film uses mythological logic: I repeat myself but the subconscious is projected onto the outside world. That is how our ancestors saw the world. That why they thought that if the King plunged a spear into a hole of Holy water, the land would be prosperous. It's metaphorical. But our ancestors believed that if they did not enact or rather translated the symbolical realities of their mind into the world, things would go wrong (surprise, they did!). I don't know if you realize how spiritual this movie is and again meta. Superman brings a spiritual harmony at the end of the film, the film in its form seeks such awakening. Having a film so spiritual that shits on the rational reasoning in our day and age and that was made with 250 freaking million is ""interesting"" and it is ""new"", whatever that means. 

I don't think you can understand the message of the film without the layers, you can on a subconscious level maybe but it doesn't feel complete. The act of discovery is what is important, what is important is figuring out your answers for yourself because again that is what the characters do inside the story and what the HJ is about. 

There is definitely a lot of stupidity regarding the reception of this movie. The reactions on my post reflect it perfectly (I strived to take roots and write my post as BvS was, just omitted the symbolism because that would make everyone crazy), people reacted on the behalf of how they perceived the movie without trying to understand the logic of my post. Like nobody tried to understand the logic of the movie. It's nice to see you can't stop the meta. 

I don't care if people didn't like the movie or found it ""bad"", I don't want to change that. That's their subjective experience. I want to share something meaningful and have a discussion about it. Yet people are totally closed to stepping out of their own perspective (and we all are,w e can philosophy on that, I received the movie better because I think more like the guys who made it maybe, but that makes my envy to share all the most important), so of course a movie with a perspective that is different from the usual would be rejected (there's no absolute, I am not saying that is the only reason, but it would be foolish not to consider). Sadly, everything that is a bit alien doesn't land to good among people who like so much their ""sci-fi"". 

What is very funny is that subjectivity (meta again, I know it's beginning to be boring:""what we do is we project ourselves unto him""). That is exactly what happens when someone says ""Snyder didn't think about the quarter of what you said"". On one side there is someone like me who has thought about it and therefore think it was intended. On the other hand, we have someone who saw nothing in it and project that attitude to the Creator. So both time there is projection. And, this is where it gets funny and why I purposefully have chosen ""Creator"": that is exactly the problem of spirituality vs pessimism (materialism if you will). Was the universe (seen as a creative act) purposefully intended or was it all a gamble. And that is again something that drives the movie (I know, we drown into so much meta-ishness), that dichotomy. People react to the unknown, Superman, in two ways: 

- Fear, the primal reaction to something unknown that can harm you, harm your self-ego. The unknown is something from the outside so integrating it modifies the structure of personality (yet again where the movie is magnificent is that this alien represent something that is so deeply within us and therefore demands us to reconnect with ourselves through the stranger/the other, inside out). 

- and Hope. Hope is faith. It is the belief in the benevolence of the flow of life, of the plan of the universe. Superman is beyond humanity (he can represent God, the next step in evolution, whatever), some have hope in the inherent ""capacity of every living being to do good"", to strive for life, to preserve life (which is again why there is all that thing about birth/creation/etc)

The movie presents us with those different subjective. People reaching for the Superman, people fearing him. Now that you have all the meta I let you have the deduction regarding the film and its reception, and what is my mean way. 

This all thing about ""reaching"" and seeing more than the author is also a serious misunderstanding of what art is. Any great works of art grow way beyond the limit of what it was intended because it implies that it creates such an assemblage that the birth of new structure is possible effortlessly. Any person who has gotten into a creative flow knows she is no more in control but resting in the hands of our subconscious and guided by force greater than him, he is merely a vector for the creative flow, a gateway. It would then be foolish to assume the author is conscious about all the things that his work implied. He is not omniscient. 

... All of that is also why reading my post independently of BvS doesn't matter. It stands on its own ...

Hope you enjoyed the ride.

Extra cooki in the jar: 

&gt;People talk about watching the film 6-10+ times before 'getting it'

I have seen BvS four or five times, I don't watch it much because you need to be in the mood. But I have surely thought about it and discussed it way more. I don't know what is your point about the rewatching thing, how is that not a good thing? It's great. It's like being reborn again and again to finally have an awakening. it's very Nietzschean too I guess. But yes, it is far from ""instant gratification"". Mulholland Drive is hated by some for the same reason, but me I have enjoyed the hell out of that psychoanalytic analysis of a man who saw the movie more than 30 times, and he doesn't say he understands it. Or more, that he understands it in his way but do not deny other interpretation of the film.

The face of the man who killed his brother, Willem, was crystal clear in his memory though. Yoren's desire for revenge consumed him so much that it blotted out what should have been a cherished memory of his family.

That story foreshadows Arya's own descent into vengeance. Right now, if she wanted to, she could be with her own kin, people who love her and miss her. Instead her pursuit of vengeance has overridden her familial bonds.

6212,"From across the pond, welcome to pretty much the best sport ever!  We're glad you're here :)  I'm gonna try to keep it general, cuz I think once you've got the basics down you can just watch some games and refine it from there.  Also, I learned a lot of stuff about the game by playing video games like The Show, so if you can get a copy of that and wanna get more in-depth that's actually not a bad way to come at it from a different angle.

Let's start with the overall structure of the game.  One of the things that's different from most sports is how many games there are in a season, and to accommodate that two teams will play several games in a row against each other.  That's only really important if you don't want to look silly when talking to another baseball fan.  As far as actual game structure, there are nine **innings** a game.  Each inning has a ""top"" and a ""bottom;"" in Major League Baseball the away team gets to hit in the top of an inning and the home team defends (""fields"").  

Arguably the main competition happening within a game is between the pitcher and the batter.  Whenever a batter steps up to take his swings, that's called an **at bat** or AB for short.  During an AB, the batter will try to swing at pitches in what's called the **strike zone**.  The strike zone (and correct me if I'm wrong on this guys cuz it has changed some) is the width of home plate and the height is between a batter's belt and his knees.  It's important to understand the strike zone because then you can understand **balls** and **strikes**.  A ball is whenever a pitcher throws outside the strike zone and the batter doesn't swing at it.  However, if a batter *does* swing and either misses the ball or fouls it off, it counts as a strike.  A **foul** is when the batter puts the bat on the ball but it goes out of bounds.  This can be into the seats, behind the batter's box, outside the foul lines (those little white lines that go straight out from home plate, cross third and first base, and extend all the way to the edge of the outfield), etc.  

The total number of balls and strikes in an AB is called the **count**.  The count's important because once a batter gets 4 balls, he takes first base on a **walk**, which is also called a ""base on balls"" in ye olde lingoe and why the stat is abbreviated BB.  But if the pitcher throws him 3 strikes, he's out!  That's called a **strikeout**.  However, a foul ball never counts as a third strike, it's only a strike out if the batter doesn't make contact (either swinging and missing or not swinging at a pitch in the strike zone).  

There are other ways to record an **out** too; strikeouts are by far the least common.  First let's talk **fly outs**.  That's when a batter gets the ball in the air but it's caught by one of the fielders.  There are two ""special"" fly outs, one being a **pop fly**.  That's just a fly ball that doesn't leave the infield (i.e. usually it's caught by the pitcher or a baseman rather than an outfielder).  There are also **foul outs**.  Like  I said before, fouls are balls that aren't in the normal playing field.  But pretty much all stadiums have what's called ""foul territory,"" which is space between the foul lines and the seats.  If a fielder catches a fly ball that stays out of the seats, that's a foul out!  Second, though, there are **ground outs**.  A ball is considered ""live"" as soon as it touches fair ground.  All that really means is that the batter-cum-runner isn't out yet.  Anyway, if the batter hits the ball on the ground, one of the fielders can pick it up and throw it to first base.  If the ball gets to the base before the runner does, he's out!

Obviously if every batter got out all the time the game wouldn't really have a point, so there are also **hits**!  There are really only four flavors of hits: Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.  As the names imply, it's just what base the runner can manage to get to safely.  If there's a runner on second or third base, we say he's in **scoring position**, which means that any hit has a pretty good chance of getting him home.  Incidentally, that's how points or **runs** are scored: having a runner cross home plate. 

A batter is credited with a **run batted in** (RBI for short) when he gets a hit and a runner makes it home.  There are other ways to get an RBI, too:  If there's a runner in scoring position (usually third base but sometimes second if the guy is REALLY fast) and the batter hits a fly ball far enough into the outfield, the runner can still score if he **tags up** and runs home.  Since the ball hasn't hit the ground, it's not live yet.  Once it hits the fielder's glove, though, we're off to the races!  The runner first has to tag the bag he's on, then when the ball comes alive he can score.  If he does, then the batter is out but he still gets an RBI.  However, the fielders have a chance to throw the ball home and try to tag the runner out before he touches the base.  

There are other **sacrifice plays** besides the sac fly.  Batters can also hit sacrifice ground balls, but these aren't always to score runs like the sac fly is.  Explaining this part requires a lot of strategy talk so I'll steer clear of a lot of it since I'm just trying to go through the basics, but a lot of the time it's just to move a runner into scoring position.

I'll finish out by just talking about a couple of the stats you'll hear a lot about.  Ima start with hitting stats!  The most common one you'll hear is **batting average** or just ""average.""  This stat is just what percent of the time a batter will get a hit.  Also, even though a lot of these stats are shown as decimals, they're really percentages.  So like if a batter has a .250 average, chances are he'll get a hit every fourth AB.  If he's got a .333 average, it'll be a third of the time.  So on and so forth.  If a player is batting over .300 that's generally considered really good.  Jose Reyes right now has a .350 average and that's the highest in all of MLB, so that's really good.  As an historical note, batting .400 is kind of a mythical achievement that not too many guys have managed.

I've already explained RBIs, but just FYI that's the other big stat that most media outlets highlight as the most important one.  Home runs are usually the third stat that rounds out what they show you on TV when a guy steps up to bat.  It's becoming more common, though, that a player's **on base percentage** or OBP is displayed.  That's the average number of times a guy gets on base either by hits, walks, or being hit by a pitch (if a pitcher hits a batter with the ball the batter automatically gets to take first base no matter what the count is).  Some people consider OBP to be the most important stat, but that's something you can [read more about](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311262914&amp;sr=8-1) if you want.  

And now here are some pitching stats!  Probably the two biggest stats commentators highlight are **earned run average** or ERA and **wins**.  The ERA is the average number of runs that pitcher would allow in nine innings.  Say, for example, his ERA is 3.00.  That means, were he to throw all nine innings of a game, he'd give up 3 runs on average.  Anything lower than that is usually considered pretty elite.  Wins are becoming more widely regarded as kind of a meaningless stat but, nonetheless, can be a big impressive number we like to ooo and ahhh at.  The stat itself is just if one pitcher gave up fewer runs than the other.  That's kind of a gross oversimplification, but I'm not sure I can really articulate the nuances much better than that.  The pitching equivalent of OBP is the **WHIP**, or walks plus hits per inning pitched.  I say ""equivalent"" because both are stats that are really important but only just starting to be talked about during an average broadcast.  WHIP is a really crucial stat because it reflects how many baserunners the pitcher allows during an inning.  A WHIP of less than 1.00 is suuuuper good, but becoming more common in the post-steroid era.  

And with that, I think you should more or less have the tools you need to start watching and loving baseball!  Welcome again!

Part of the reason pro sports can be broadcast the way they are is because there aren't really any obstacles to obstruct view other than players, and the fields are generally pretty easy to see things on.

The problem with that is that we can only follow who the casters decide they're going to follow, which isn't really great. Maybe I want to see how the Sombra's setting up for a push, and how she's sneaking past everyone - it's not action-packed, so they're not going to follow it, but as a Sombra player myself those things are interesting to me. 

We should be able to watch through the Battle.net client if we want to be able to follow whichever players we want.

Something like 30M for Rio Ferdinand was a massive deal at the time, but it's pretty paltry compared to the types of transfers that happen these days, with the advent of the last Premier League TV deal and the general amount of money that is put into the game.

6516,"&gt;This is what was done with Fremer's file referenced in the article.

It was a claim made by a man who makes his living reviewing audiophile gear, some of it woo. Not only does he get the gear for free, he gets paid to review it. Him posting two files on the internet proves nothing. He's about as far from a disinterested observer without bias as you can get.  When people asked him questions about how it was recorded and so on it at Hydrogen Audio, he got huffed up and left. Fremer has actually taken part in blind listening tests, he promptly failed all of them. 

[And there is no need for 24/96 masters. In a listening test no one can tell it apart from 6-bit/44.1.](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14195)

&gt;Side note: have you ever been in a reputable stereo store? Not Magnolia. Have you heard a big, powerful, low distortion stereo system properly set up, sans ""woo""?

Hey, at least you're not flat out saying that I haven't listened to enough high-resolving systems to be able to have a valid opinion. :)

I've been to a lot of homes and stores, listening to a lot of gear. And have had people over to my place as well. I like good sound. The internet made it easy to meet up with others. But the sheer amount of idiocy and lack of common sense among audiophiles and the woo-selling, moneygrabbing part of the industry drives me nuts. Putting a carpet on the floor or some such will impact the sound much more than all this woo the industry is peddling. 

I suppose the most fancy speakers I've heard were a pair of JBL Everest DD67000 a couple of years ago. They sounded okay, but the guy who owned them was into jazz so it was really boring. I have a pair of old Dali Euphonia MS5 speakers hooked up to a a sixties Tandberg tube amp. The amp is not supposed to be able to drive those speakers, but hey, it does and it sounds good. I can't be arsed to get something newer, not until the amp blows up, which I suspect it will do sooner or later.

And to be honest, the vast majority of audiophiles are single, middle-aged boomers with deterioating hearing who get together to listen to different vinyl pressings of the same old boomer rock albums everyone has already heard a million times before, hoping it will sound as fresh and invigorating as it did when they were young and could still get their dicks up without viagra. For added bonus, have 15 000 dollars speakers that are placed in a corner or on a tile floors, but the cables that cost 1000 dollars really makes the sound better.

I wouldnt be this annoyed at all the supremely inplausible and un-scientific audiophile woo if I didnt know those people and how the industry works.",Music

&gt;He has never eaten a Big Mac or an Oreo or a Ding Dong. When he went to birthday parties as a kid, he would take his own cake and ice cream to avoid sugar and refined white flour. He would eat homemade catsup, prepared with honey. He did consume beef but not the kind injected with hormones. He ate only unprocessed dairy products. He teethed on frozen kidney. When Todd was one month old, Marv was already working on his son's physical conditioning. He stretched his hamstrings. Pushups were next. Marv invented a game in which Todd would try to lift a medicine ball onto a kitchen counter. Marv also put him on a balance beam. Both activities grew easier when Todd learned to walk. There was a football in Todd's crib from day one. ""Not a real NFL ball,"" says Marv. ""That would be sick; it was a stuffed ball.""[5]",nfl

But it's no different than what Harrison did in his prime and quite honestly is a huge reason concussions came into light in the past ten years. Questionable low hits, may I ask what in the hell that means? You can blame the NFL for low hits. That's the way the game is played now. Knocking over camera men? 

Vontaze Burfict is the villian the NFL and media wants. He makes crushing hits and sometimes goes a little too far. But nobody mentions how great of a linebacker he really is and quite honestly he reminds me of Harrison on the field. I enjoy watching Burficts intensity and I definitely do not condone some of his hits. But what really pisses me off about ESPN, NFL.com and fans on this subreddit is the unnecessary bullshit he gets for being a 'punk' or a 'criminal' is absolutely ubsurd. Go ahead, look it up. He's never been arrested for anything and is a gentleman off the field but because all everyone does is watch ESPN they get spoon fed an unbelievable amount of crap about him. 

If Burfict played for the Steelers he would be considered an all time great. If he played in the 80s, he would be a HOFer by the end of his career. But sadly because of the Bengals bad group of players from '00-'09, this is the persona they get which is not fair. I'm used to it by now - lol! ",nfl

To beat the heat I decided to stop by a comic store that I knew had at least a bit of manga. Maybe it's just because I haven't cared to look for them before, but an absolute ton of original shows, LN's and VN's get manga adaptations.

I knew stuff like EVA has gotten a manga release (multiple highschool spinoffs as well) but weird stuff like a shitty Steins;Gate manga, and some more oddities that I can't remember. For some of this stuff I really can't see the appeal of reading a manga adaptation.

Like Steins;Gate has a fantastic anime, and a stellar original Visual Novel that's not too long, why would you want to read a poorly adapted manga? I get that manga is more popular than anime and VN's in Japan, but who'd want to experience the story that way?

I get some stuff, like Umineko, Heaven's Feel or Tsukihime, where the manga exists to trim the fat of a very long VN, and the anime adaptations are dogshit or non existent.

They also didn't have any Hidamari manga. I might go track some of that down someday.

Also on a whim I started listening to TTGL music again. I still think [Happily Ever After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQ8d1bMf6U) is my favorite track.

6645,"They failed in the event that mattered most, the majors. The other tournaments don't matter nearly as much, especially when they ultimately couldn't win and kept coming in 2nd. 2nd place is sometimes worse than last, as seen from the breakdown of Zeus na'vi where there was a lot of tension and frustration and blame on the team which couldn't win and always came in 2nd during the zeus era, which lead to them backstabbing and kicking him behind his back. I think a few members like guardian/seized even publicly said that Zeus lost his team and the team was in disarray and they stopped listening to his calls and lost trust in him and Zeus has said it himself that he lost his team and they no longer accepted him as their leader and stopped listening and trusting him anymore (and if you look back in their interviews, they were all very unhappy and even seemed resentful with the results and blamed Zeus for not being able to pull his weight). Guardian also said once that he felt coming in 2nd all the time and not being able to win felt hopeless and that it felt good to finally win and to prove to himself they can actually win (after their win at ESL ONE NY with s1mple).

There's also been studies done (google it if you don't believe me) that show that silver Olympic winners are the least happiest out of all the medalists (gold, silver, and bronze) and are most likely to be disappointed and angry at themselves and bronze medalists were overall happy and much more happier than silvers (because most were happy to just to get a medal) while silver medalists felt that they failed or fell short. And obviously gold medalists were the happiest overall. The even worse part was let alone getting 2nd, they bombed out at the most important event of the year 0-3 in the group stages and failed to get legend status. And faze's twitter (meaninglessly) tweeted that this result was unacceptable right after, which seems odd since most teams don't usually release statements regarding their failures or address it publicly, so I felt the faze management must have been distraught or severely disappointed in this team and their results at the major, and no longer believed in them to ultimately be able to win, which lead to this change.",GlobalOffensive

The other way, if you're traveling in a non-English country is to have one person expense dinner for 2-3 people and the others buy the drinks.

I started to scroll through them to see if I could see anything. The screen would flash between each picture of the chair. Then between every picture. Then the screen just started flashing on and off and changing colors. The second every picture was deleted it went back to normal and it never happened again. I noped the fuck right out of there.

6883,"Man, this show keeps teasing us! No massive battle with Reinhard (yet), but we do get to see Yang destroy and take down 3+ admirals. Considering his own limited forces, the fact that Yang basically crushes them through the use of psychology and the environment.

First of all, the use of a black hole was masterfully done. Piercing through the enemy's weak point and turning their weakness into a strength is wonderfully done. Plus, using Mr. Lennen's thought that everything is a trap (after Iserlohn) let them escape without being destroyed. One thing that bothers me a bit is the whole ""helium explosion"" thing, as not only do things not explode in space (due to lack of oxygen), but helium is an inert gas. It isn't a huge thing to be bothered by, but it would have been a least a bit better if they used hydrogen. Either way, the traps were very well done, and Reinhard is not happy at all.

Also, we get another one of my favourite moments in the series: Yang wondering why everyone is on his ship. The one section with [Yang asking ""what is that?"" while pointing at Machungo is one of this series famous out of context shots](https://imgur.com/a/pVUEi).

Finally, we hear of Reinhard's plan to take down Yang: send out a bunch of thin layers well spread apart in order the drain Yang's endurance, while the rest of his forces come and surround him. It is well thought out, and considering Reinhard has to partake in the battle so that he can ""defeat Yang"", it is the best plan they could probably come up with.

The moment at the end with Reinhard was both sad and strangely happy at the same time. The fact that his path of battle was decided long ago (since his sister was taken) goes to show Reinhard has a set path in life that none can change. Much like Yang has been forced into battle due to finance and a one time ""miracle"", Reinhard has been forced to do battle for his sister, and then Kircheis. However, he is now about to engage the one person in the galaxy who can (and has) bested him in battle, and he can finally go all out with his skill. This is perhaps the first time since the death of Kircheis that Reinhard is happy, because he found someone he could connect with in the enemy.",anime

Until you are in the most intimate of situations, you would not know their sex.

Let's break the planet into particles (Science is dangerous), and remove particles that cancel one another out. Starting with your left hand, there will be no particles matching those closest to you; along the left wall. Particles on the right wall will correspond to particles past the left wall, the same distance apart. By the time you've accounted for the entire planet, there will be two groups that do not have a match: a cluster to your left (The same size and shape as the cavity you occupy), and a half-circle shell comprising the right-most particles of the planet, with thickness the same as the cavity. Comparing these two groups; first of all, there is an absurd difference in proximity. Secondly, the nearby group will have dramatically more density, as it occupies the center of the Earth. So, while the half-shell group has more volume, it may not have more mass. The left arm will be pulled towards the nearby cluster at forces than render the half-shell group negligible, but it remains to be calculated how strong this force is in the first place.

Assuming you are in a 3m diameter cavity, and assuming wikipedia's estimates of the core density of the Earth are accurate, the mass to the left will be a bit under 100 metric tonnes. At a distance of 1.5m to the center of its mass, the left arm will experience a gravitational pull of... Negligibly small amount. I concede to your conclusion",funny

&gt; “He said, ‘I’m talking to Michael Flynn about this—if you find anything, can you let me know?’” said Eric York, a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith’s behalf for people who might have access to the emails.

&gt; In another recruiting email seen by the Journal, Jonathan Safron, a law student Mr. Smith described as a close colleague, included links to the websites and LinkedIn profiles of people purportedly working with the Smith team. At the top of the list was the name and website of Flynn Intel, which Mr. Flynn set up.

&gt; In phone conversations, Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son, according to this expert. 

Here is some more background. Peter W. Smith was involved in the Heritage Foundation, the RNC, and GOPAC.

**edit: couln't let this gem of a reply by u/neotropic9 get buried:**

&gt;It's no wonder The Martian took best comedy.
Damon's comedic timing was consistently on point. The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory.
One thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, “Astronaut Mark Watney... was killed.” Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, “this is mutiny.”
Stranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.)
It's no wonder The Martian picked up Best Comedy. If you're looking for a good joke, you can count on the Golden Globes.",movies

I don't care that you're a diamond 1 yasuo main and you lose games to X and Y counters or need to have Z condition satisfied to win a teamfight, he's just in a state where he dictates the flow of the whole game simply by existing.

Master Yi, Yasuo, Kayle, and Tryndamere require you to keep a thumb firmly placed on top of them for the entire game, while having a strong enough early game that you have to constantly worry about whether or not they can jump on and kill you. Kayle, Tryndamere, and Yi have cooldowns that can be abused. Fight them while their ults are down and you can lock them down and kill them easily without much fear of retaliation. Yasuo has Windwall, and honestly it's not that abusable because the knockups provide a lot of defense and utility for him too.

Not only does Yasuo have the best mobility of the four (it's conditional, but Tryndamere's is the only unconditional one and it's a bad skill tbh), with the least important abusable cooldown (and everything else being constantly available), he also doesn't use mana, has the biggest offensive steroid, and does just as much damage as the rest.

No, you can't just stand there and duel someone. Yasuo is at his weakest against a solitary enemy. But if his weaknesses are lockdown, dueling while surrounded by his own minions, and ""being difficult to play,"" I really can't see why he shouldn't be considered way overtuned.",leagueoflegends

Remember, Arthas had just encountered the Scourge plague earlier that day. Or maybe a couple days had gone by, but not many, and he still knew almost nothing about it. He hadn't tried having the plague healed, except maybe by the combat medic priest he happened to have with him - far from an expert. He hadn't tried imposing a quarantine. He hadn't had his mages do any research on necromancy. And when Uther and Jaina suggested ANYTHING other than slaughter, he disbanded Uther's entire order of paladins.

Don't be scared of them because they're female... we're human too... so treat them like that instead of girls. 

Let them make choices and mistakes and listen to them. Do this early in life so by the time they stop listening to you, they'll hopefully be strong, independent woman who have learnt from their own mistakes and are confident.

If they're not dating them to rebel, then by being friendly, you're showing you respect your daughters and their decisions. They're also more likely to go to you if they need you if you're not an over-bearing protective Dad.

There are thousands of signs like this posted on our fields every growing season, and if it weren't for agricultural TFW's, our crops would go wasted every growing season.  Bad idea.

Other crappy jobs, like canning, lame factory work, lowly services, etc. also have this problem increasingly.  

Where there are economic downturns, however, we should lower the amount of TFW's, and that's what happens.  Between 2013 and 2015, the number of temporary foreign workers in Canada dropped from 163,000 to just over 90,000. [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/05/16/temporary-foreign-worker-program-canada_n_16644834.html)

As for paying lowly services jobs more wages, lol, no.  The plan is to blame the workers' bad attitudes instead.  We are constantly told we are lazy workers, gawking at our phones all day, etc.[2](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/were-hooked-on-foreign-workers/article18348408/?arc404=true)

Is this true, however?  Nope.  We're no more lazy than TFW's.  We're just more able to stick up for our labour rights, whereas TFW's are more likely to suck it up and do the job for pitiful earnings because it's even more dire for them at home.

We enjoy weekly guild activities such as speed runs of farm content (Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, and The Nighthold) where we gear our new players and alt characters and Mythic+ pushes to ensure that everyone has a chance to get a +15 run for the week. Our members are very active and social in game and we have a Discord channel to communicate out of game. If you are looking for a calm, peaceful place to focus on progression while enjoying the company of your fellow guild members, this is the place for you!  
  
**Recruiting**  
We are currently openly recruiting the listed classes and specializations for our Core Raider team. In addition, we are always openly recruiting all classes and specializations for our casual raiding team as well as social players who would like to be a part of our friendly community.  
  
* Death Knight (Blood) - High  
* Druid (Balance) - High  
* Monk (Windwalker) - Medium  
* Paladin (Retribution) - Medium  
* Rogue (Any Spec) - Medium  
* Shaman (Elemental) - High  
  
**Raiding**  
Battle Scars was formed half-way into The Nighthold raid tier. After developing our raid team, we ended Nighthold with 4/10 Mythic kills and look forward to progressing even further in Tomb of Sargeras where we have been able to advance into a new tier together as a team. Our current progression in Tomb of Sargeras is 7/9 Heroic.  
  
For continuing Tomb of Sargeras progression and looking forward towards the Antorus raid, we will be raiding three days per week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm server time). We also have raids for the Normal level of the current tier on Wednesday that are mandatory at the beginning of the tier and change to optional after the first month.  
  
While we pride ourselves on our friendly community and non-toxic raiding environment, we do expect all members of our raiding team to come fully prepared and focused to our raids. We are able to create this unique environment by respecting our fellow raid members and the time, effort, and dedication that every other member of our team is putting in each day. As such, we prefer players who are excited about raiding and look forward to learning and working to progress through new content.  
  
**Contact**  
If you are interested in joining our community, please feel free to contact Branches or Joséphines in game. I can also be reached on BattleTag at Branches#21688 or via Discord at Branches#0460. Joséphines can also be reached via Discord at Jo (Joséphines)#4873. We look forward to hearing from you!  ",wow

Now unless he has massive success everyone will forever remember him bailing on LeBron even if James leaves Cleveland next season

He should have played out the 1st of his remaining 2 years (before his player option kicks in), tried for a chip, and then ran the team himself in 2018-2019

Kyrie - JR Smith, Shumpert, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson

Not a great team but not a terrible team. And if he wants the spotlight so badly why not show the world that even WITHOUT LeBron that he can still keep the Cavs relevant.

He is worried LeBron leaves, Cavs take a dive, and everyone says LOOK LeBron was carrying this team (rightfully so anyways) the entire time

we built our system so there is not a tyranny of the majority.  The whole Point of electoral system was a compromise between large and small states.  The system was designed so a candidate cannot just get the large states and call it a wrap.  Rural states that provided a lot of food and resources needed equal representation when compared to large urban locations.  Each group face a different set of challenges and have different solutions.  Without this design all you have to do is win Texas California and New York.  there really is no other reason to hit the other states.  So when I said group think I was referring to getting a few major population centers.

We have state caucuses to flush out the candidates and evolve the conversation. That is the purpose of the debates, to refine conversations.

The question the USA needs to ask is why is there a separation from the coasts and Central America?  

And if our country was such a laughing stock why are we having a conversation about building walls to keep other people out.  Historically walls were built to keep people in.  

 The challenges we face are the same France and the U.K. And many other countries are facing.  No one has the solution figured out yet.  ",Music

7465,"1.  formatting, please fix
2. You are saying this from **YOUR** point of view, please consider that there are a very broad range of player skills out there.

There actual GUILDS right now who are progressing through normal. Yes, content that is easily puggable is still difficult for some ""raiding guilds"". There are many guilds who do not manage to get ahead of the curve each raid tier.

For me? Sure normal is irrelevant after 2-3 weeks since heroic is on farm and mythic bosses are going down. But for a vast part of the player base it is still relevant content. It still gives those players something to do while they wipe for 2 weeks on goroth heroic. 

Now you could come with the usual ""GIT GUD"" argument for those players, however they don't want that. They raid 1-2 times a week. They are people with jobs/kids, etc that can only spare 6hours/week for wow. They don't have ""optimized gear"", they don't have concordance, heck maybe some of them never really realized they can unlock new traits since 7.2. However they go and raid for 3 hours, maybe they kill 2-3 normal bosses and they consider it a success.

7477,"This sounds a little lame, but it's always worked for me. If you want to strike up a conversation with someone, flattery is always a good openers. Things like 'I like your shoes', or, 'what perfume are you wearing' are great because they show you are interested in the person in a non-creepy way (unless you actually go up to them and sniff them..) and they provide a conversation opener, as opposed to just requiring a yes or no answer. Besides, most people like to know they smell good, or have great taste in shoes. If they didn't care, they wouldn't have spent money on perfume or shoes.

Something else that helps is not being mean to people. Sounds ridiculous, right? I have someone I occasionally hang out with, who always puts me down. Little things like, calling me ""simple and naive"" for watching birthing videos on YouTube (was bored), and calling me ""little and not very smart"" for disagreeing with her. I know she's insecure, but it doesn't endear her to me, and, as a result, I've decided not to be friends with her any longer. I know she thinks she's being cute, ironic and funny but it's not. 

Bottom line, insulting people (even if you think it's funny and ironic and shows what ""great friends"" you are) is not cool. It makes things awkward.

7498,"Love Live! S1EP11: The Greatest Live Performance

Greetings Comrades and fellow Denizens of the Wired, I hope that you have been enjoying all of the fluff and fun times, because it's time to get ready for the TOURNAMENT ARC! [Love Live!](/s ""AND DRAMA AND SADNESS!"") We're about to get serious now Comrades, so without further ado, let's get to it! Warning, Love Live! and Gundam Build Fighters Try spoilers below, enjoy!

Before we begin this episode, we must address our recap, brought to us by the glorious Nico! She even graces us with the powerful Nico Nico Nii as she delivers a wonderful introduction. Oh, wait, she was supposed to recap the beach episode wasn't she? Hold on a second, some foul heretic slandered Nico by claiming she was ""lame,"" Nico even said so in the episode, this must be the work of an enemy stand! But before going into that, let's move on to the episode.

We see Honoka departing for school, introducing herself as if it were the first episode of a series. Also, it appears that Japan's phenomenon of declining birth rates is canon for the series' universe, which makes thing interesting given [Gundam Build Fighters Try](/s ""the links that Love Live! has with Gundam Build Fighters Try, given that Otonokizaka Academy is one of the participants in the series."")

Also, we see that μ's has had some great success recently, as they somehow jumped from rank 50 to rank 19, more than enough to qualify for the TOURNAMENT ARC! I must say that even having seen this before, I am still surprised as to the massive jump. I mean, the beach episode was great and all, but was that all it took to jump the ranks that much? Guess the fans like the fanservice.

Anyways, Honoka informs the bird and Umi of the good news, before screaming out a title drop for the heavens. Honoka's classmates are also pleased to hear of the good news, and are shocked at Honoka's informal greeting with Eli. Honoka then explains the plot of the last episode to the trio.

As the trio wisely try to get autographs before the final push for stardom, we see one of the candidates for world's smallest signature, courtesy of Umi. Honoka, noticing this, writes one of the largest signatures I've seen so far, so big in fact that she partially ran out of room.

Additionally, it appears that the glorious Nico is off duty at the moment, which I still am surprised over. If she gushed so much over her merch, you'd think she'd be overjoyed at giving out autographs, but I digress.

Honoka then notices that the bird is missing, and we cut away to the bird, who is pensively staring at the ominous letter we saw a few episodes ago. We then move on to Serval and Honoka gushing over the stage they are to perform on. Nico criticizes her backup dancers' swooning, until she too is overcome by emotions and squee.

Eli and Nozomi arrive to inform the baka trio that they can't rest yet, as there are still two weeks to go, and every school idol group is giving it their all for the final push. As Nico declares her readiness to do whatever is needed, Eli decided to assign Nico... the grand task of participating in a lottery.

Undeterred, Nico takes this in stride and dramatically turns the handle. As everyone goes into slo-mo and waits in anticipation, sans Nozomi who does her typical mystical stuff, we get the dramatic result of... complete and utter failure.

Clearly we had interference, someone rigged the lottery, it must be the heretic from earlier, OR AN ENEMY STAND! But, moving on to the failure of μ's to secure the use of the auditorium. Meanwhile, it appears that the morale of Nico's backup dancers has completely broken, with even Nozomi in shock, oh the humanity! She isn't even Washi-Washing people, NANI!

The members of μ's panic on the rooftop, sans the unflappable Maki, with even Nozomi broken from the experience. Eli then tries to smooth things over by suggesting that μ's practice somewhere else. Nico suggesting using the club room, after all, they got that expansion recently, but Honoka claims that it still is too cramped.

Then, Honoka comes up with a (bad) idea to practice in the more cramped area of the hallway. Nico rightly notes that they'd all look like idiots if they did that. After a bit of arguing Honoka comes up with the idea of practicing on the roof.

Honoka then proposes that, in order to attract people to the roof, that they merely sing very loud. As Honoka and the bird walk home, the bird seems preoccupied with something. After a bit of mumbling, the bird states that they should all give it all they've got.

We then see the bird and her mom discussing something seriously important, to which the bird is to make the final decision on. Honoka's suggestion for the performance is a new song of Maki's, to which all the members swear to work hard on to ensure that they are ready for the performance. As Honoka is to be the center, she is told by Eli to work twice as hard to ensure peak performance.

Honoka interprets this to mean night training, to which her sister warns of her to be careful, right as admission information to Otonokizaka can be seen under her homework. We then see a lovely poster for the upcoming concert, with Nico rightly in the front, and Serval rightly with a cat-like expression on her face.

As the bird attempts to speak with Honoka again, Honoka runs off to tell everyone in the class about the concert. Honoka appears to be working overtime, as she came up with new dance moves, which raises feelings of apprehension amongst the group, except for the acquiescence of the bird.

Umi tells Honoka that she should take it easy, Honoka responds by ignoring this advice. Umi attempts to get the bird to help, but the bird sides with Honoka. Later, we see Honoka sneezing as she's on the phone, it's probably nothing right? [Love Live!](/s ""IT'S NOT!"")

Honoka thinks that the bird is not acting any differently, before sneezing again. As Umi tells Honoka to NOT get sick and take the night off, Honoka decides to ignore the sane member of her year and go off training again... IN THE RAIN!

Please excuse me for a second while I smash my head into my workdesk.

Ow, well, now that that's out of the way, Umi gets a call from the bird, as the bird has some important plot stuff to say. Hm... I wonder what this could be...

After Honoka's night of training, her mom wakes her up, scolding Honoka for not waking up earlier for the cultural festival. Honoka's response is to sneeze again, with blurred vision to boot, before collapsing. With a look of shock, she feels her throat, before we cut to Serval and Hanayo noting the pouring rain at the roof.

Meanwhile, while Nico is getting excited, Umi and the bird are discussing something serious. Honoka shows up late and unprepared, before stumbling into the bird. Eli claims Honoka's voice sounds strange, to which Honoka claims she can just take a cough drop.

The trio of colleagues are busy advertising the concert, the members of μ's note that the rain isn't letting up. Honoka states that they should perform anyway, as they of μ's do not give up. Amidst the rain, the members of μ's prepare to start, with Eli and Honoka's sisters in the audience as well.

We then move on to a rocking performance from the great members of μ's, surely nothing can go wrong right?

WRONG! After the great performance, Honoka keels over from the deadly Japanese Cold! EGADS! I know Sunrise made this show and all, but who let crazy ol' Kill 'em All Tomino in to guest write? Oh wait, she JUST has a fever, and you know, has collapsed from utter exhaustion.

THIS IS STILL NOT GOOD, NOT ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU!

[](#notaccordingtokeikaku)

As Honoka is sprawled out in the rain, all she can mumble is for the next song, to which the bird wails in sadness.

[](#everythingisfine)

Well, that was certainly a way to end an episode. I've seen it all before and I'm still at a loss for words. See you all on the next thread, and until then, farewell, now, if you'll excuse me.

This kind of cyclical coverage happens because many in the trees community are not active consumers of media/news, which actually diminishes their standings in the democratic process (one must be informed to have an effect within the halls of representative governance). 

To that end, encouraging these kind of articles (even if they are outdated) engenders the standing of the individual person in the lawmaking process, as the point is not so much to break a ""new story"", but rather teach all in the community about something they may have missed due to the transient nature of reddit's day to day userbase.

To that end, we must inculcate an ethos which encourages (not shames) posting information about ongoing political issues; as, in this way, we take back the halls of government and force the bells of democracy to toll once more.

To do otherwise invites a literal conflagration of monied faction to take over the law making process (as Madison warned of in Federalist no.10-http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp), which would end up swallowing whole the very oxygen the union needs to breathe (that essential freedom and liberty for which it was first conceived).",trees

Are you seriously going to tell me that there is NO correlation between skin colour and when different people immigrated to Canada? 

Serious question, were the majority of early immigrants to Canada English and French? What was the colour of their skin? Or were they Africans from Zimbabwe?

Did Japanese originally colonize Canada? 

And the Japanese are a great example. Historically, were they treated the same as say white people? A Japanese kid born here 30 years ago does benefit very similarly compared to a white kid, but did his parents benefit in the same way? 

Were there ever internment camps in Canada for white people? Or was that just for Japanese people? Hmmm. Did you know that when BC joined Canada it was done on the *explicit* basis that non-white people in BC would not be allowed to vote? 

Your attempt to create some weird false equivalency here won't work. And yes, newer immigrants still bear responsibility in improving the situation of First Nations people (many of them don't even know the history of First Nations people), but let's not pretend they have the same history as European / white colonizers.

Who wrote the laws governing First Nations people? Who wrote the Indian Act? Was it the Japanese? Was it the Africans? Or was it post-European colonists? 

YOU brought skin colour into this, not me. And you said ""Seems like this based on skin colour not family lines or when people got here"", so tell me, what was the skin colour of the first and largest waves of immigrants and colonizers in Canada?

If you're giving me some flexibility, I would have taken VGK before the expansion draft because it would be fun as hell.

I would never have dealt with Minnesota or Anaheim. Would have taken their best players available and traded for picks.

I would have taken 5 goalies, and traded 3 of them for picks.

I would have done exactly what they did with Florida, not sure how that was pulled off.

Would have offered 8-9x4 to Radulov and put him right on the trade market for 5x4 with retained salary to try and get some assets back. 

I would not have kept a single full time NHL player from the expansion draft - fire sale, everything must go.

I would be signing Doan, Jagr, Iginla, and all of the other iconic elderly players just because. I need to ice a team somehow.

I would commit to a full tank for 2 years before I start  putting my youngsters in the show.

I would go to Edmonton and Washington and tell them I'm offer sheeting Kuzy and Drai unless they give me picks. 

I would throw money at every KHL player who wants to come over.

Then I wait for my prospects to break out, and hope for a Buffalo/Toronto/Carolina type situation with an influx of high end young players.

&gt; 2.5.2 Electric-vehicle-ready homes

These receptacles can be used with home charging stations and readily available at retail locations and are compatible with all plug-in hybrid and electric cars.

7785,"&gt;Did you read what I was pointing out? People are declaring him trash and never actually having played him in that state!

because as if magically all the whining is from people who never played new hog. No...that simply is not the case.

I was a former roadhog main, and have a friend who was a former roadhog main, i looked at the numbers and gave his new iteration a good college try and found it to be quite shit. 

At the bare basics of your argument i agree that people should play new hog at least a little bit before they say one way or the other, but to think **all** of the bitching is from people who never played new hog is quite ignorant to be honest. 

&gt; You know what we call this shit? a goddamn bandwagon! People are deriding hog's current state because it's popular to do so, not because people have actually played him seriously themselves, and the few that do mostly have their core arguments in road not being as effective at being a solo flanker like he used to, which should never have been his role to begin with.

Um...no. Hog never was suppose to be a solo flanker but people will play the hero however way they want. 

Hog's main asset was a punishing combo that worked really well if your were out of position, guess what lower skilled players have in spades? shitty positioning. 

the few? you are discounting the people who actually played hog to a few just because it supports your argument? i legitimately do not have time to explained how flawed that is, but my god. 

I mean there really doesn't need to be a core argument. Hog got a slight damage nerf, ruined his combo and now the hero is trash tier. You can see it very clearly he was not broken, and hasn't been for a long time. A slight damage nerf does not revert all the shitty things people were saying, because they were completely unfounded. 

people died to him and got made because rather than think it had to do with their skill level the hero **must** be op. *whew, almost got better at the game for a second there...fuck roadhog his hook is op*. 

the hook combo had way to many downsides to consider it Op, this change was very kneejerk is the bottom line. It honestly wouldn't be a bandwagon circle jerk if people actually looked up/played before talking all sorts of shit. 

&gt;lso, your excuse is BS in any case. Go practice him in QP, 3v3 or even against bots.

Because practice will change a damage nerf.... Sometimes there is no amount of skill that can change a hero, if they are shitty they will be shitty. 

No other hero needs to supplement their damage as much as hog does now, seems rather evident you don't play him either so i would recommend stepping off the high horse. 

It takes a game or two to really see how useless hog is. he is an ult battery, i used to fear hog but now i am happy when i see him on the enemy team. i call it out ""they have a hog, shoot him up that is an ult battery""

I recommend people play for themselves but roadhog is useless since the only thing he was going to get used for was taken away.

I used to be very terrible at interactions with other people and had little to no social skills, but, through a series of choices, I managed to build up my skills and now I am doing okay! One of the first things I did was make the conscious decision to go out of my way and change that aspect of my life. For me, this happened around 8th grade. I ended up joining the Legislative Debate team in order to bolster my public speaking skills and learn to talk to people. This taught me how to speak and maintain conversations with people, however, it didn't really help with gaining friends and learning how to meet new people. What helped me with this was moving from Michigan to Missouri for college. This forced me wayyy out of my comfort zone and basically left me with the choice to go out of my way and make friends, or know nobody there. It was a rough first couple of weeks, but it taught me how to find common ground with almost anyone, regardless of whether we are similar in personality. It also taught me to be more open to new experiences, as doing something that someone else is interested in/passionate about can go a long way in making friends.

As for why it's undisputed is because of 2 primary factors: Health of Competitors and Drastic differences in positions. The 2 other players that tend to come up in conversations about being the GOAT are Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr. Lemieux played the same position as Gretzky in the same era and is the only player to ever be close to his level of scoring, but he had a slew of injury and other heath problems throughout his career. Bobby Orr played Defense and revolutionized the position but it's practically impossible to compare Defenseman to Forwards. On top of that Orr was forced into an early retirement due to Knee injuries and never got to play against Gretzky. Goalies never come up in the conversation at all for the same reasons.

Fair enough.

&gt; We shared ideological values with most of the other members. Today that is no longer the case.

I really think that you still do.

&gt; Sweden is a nascent Islamic state that wants an open border with the middle east.

Oh, for the love of Christ.  No, it doesn't.

Look, I was complaining quite some time back that I think that the EU's immigration policy is fundamentally flawed.  Right now, the EU lets any member extend citizenship, provides no member with any influence over the criteria that other members use, and requires all members to extend quite extensive privileges to the citizens of other members.  That's a risky combination; it's open to selling citizenship and the like.  Malta could, in theory, pull in a population the size of Germany and radically change the makeup of the EU.

If there's an issue with the EU on immigration, that's a big chunk of where it is.  It's not because positions on immigration have drastically changed, but because freedom of movement without some degree of shared control over immigration invariably is going to leave people in a position where immigration that the majority oppose can happen.

Maybe the EU needs immigration (unpopular or not).  Personally, I think that it does, if it's not going to get its birthrate up.  But if it does that, then it also needs to handle the political fallout of a large amount of immigration, which it clearly failed to do in the case of the British public.",europe

Remember I first heard the song when I was in Grade 7 from a band performance by some other guys in another class, they totally sucked (sorry) but funnily I found the song good enough to ask around my friends what song it was and who it was by.  

I remember asking like 10 people until I finally knew Linkin Park (I'm from HK and LP wasn't the biggest there back then in 2006).  Went home, jammed it, found more songs by them,  jammed more.  Downloaded HT, Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, cramped them all into my iPod nano.  Back then the Nano had only 128mb, so I couldn't fit anything else so it was nothing but Linkin park everyday for a straight year.  

Then I went to college in the states and gone through a year where I found out later was depression.  Never thought I would get it, didn't want to talk to anybody for days,  would rather starve until late AM just so I wouldn't meet anybody in the kitchen.  Didn't want to Skype my parents, didn't want to get out of bed to classes, grades slipping hard,  not even wanting to go partying (which I loved during Freshman year).

I didn't seek help at all since I didn't realize I was depressed at all at the time, I thought I was just not interested in school, but I was actually not interested in anything at all in life.  What got me through this period was the LP music I so so love; not because the lyrics were ""edgy"" or ""angst"" but my familiarity with them.  I owe them because they provided me with comfort where I don't need to give a single damn about outside life.  Thank you, Chester.

&gt; X (later changed to X JAPAN in 1992 to avoid confusion with the American punk band X) is arguably one of the most influential bands in the history of the Japanese music scene. Formed by childhood friends Yoshiki and Toshi in 1982 at Chiba, Japan, X was originally founded to play high energy rock music. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited for pioneering the visual kei movement. 

&gt; Their early music was speed metal, but later on they acquired a more symphonic metal sound.

&gt; The band consisted of Toshi (vocals), Yoshiki(drums, piano, composer, lyricist), hide (guitar), Pata (guitar), and Heath (bass), and Taiji (bassist) until 1997 when they disbanded. 

&gt; Once Yoshiki and Toshi recruited bassist Taiji and guitarists hide and Pata, the band began moving on the indie circuit. They garnished abundant support and fans across Japan with their outrageous dress style.
 
They used long, dyed hair and leather, along with makeup to make themselves shocking to the people who went to see them. This look, and their musical style of fast, driving metal, mixed with softer ballads, was the defining origin of today's visual kei band.

&gt; However, in 1996, after the release of their fifth and final album, DAHLIA, Toshi announced that he was departing from the band, for his own reasons - rumored to do with his wife disliking the band, his time commitment, and their performance of mostly sad, downbeat songs. Rather than go on without Toshi, the following year X JAPAN announced it was breaking up. At the end of the year, they had their final concert. X Japan split up in 1997.

&gt; Four months later, May 2, 1998, Hideto ""hide"" Matsumoto, X Japan's lead guitarist, was found dead, hanged  with a towel tied to a doorknob in his Tokyo Apartment. While authorities deem the guitarist's death a suicide, several of hide's friends and colleagues stated that they believed it an accident, this was supported by the fact that there was no suicide note.

&gt; However, a new wind has begun to blow for X JAPAN, as Toshi has stated his desire for a reunion for the 25th anniversary of the band's founding.

&gt; In March 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a ""new project"" would commence soon. An X Japan reunion was officially confirmed on June 4, 2007, with Yoshiki announcing a tour, as well as a new single (a re-recording of the song ""Without You"", originally from Yoshiki's 2005 solo album Eternal Melody II) to be underway and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata, regarding their participation. About ten undisclosed guitarists were to fill in for the late hide during concerts.

&gt; The band held its first live performance on October 22, 2007, on the rooftop of the shopping center Aqua City in Odaiba, Tokyo, during which a music video for the newly recorded song ""I.V."" was filmed. ""I.V."" also appears on the soundtrack of the movie Saw 4.

&gt; During 2008 the band made more lives appearances and on May 2 and 3, 2009, the band held two live shows at the Tokyo Dome. Both shows were completely sold out.  On May 30, the band did their first live show with Sugizo in Taiwan.

&gt; On January 9, 2010 the band made its first public U.S. appearance by shooting four new music videos in Hollywood. [61] The four videos were for Rusty Nail, Jade, Endless Rain and I.V..

&gt; On July 1, the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic version of I.V., and recorded a music video of a new song, Born to be Free.

&gt; During the following month, X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News, the L.A. Times, and Chicago Sun-Times.  On August 8th, 2010, X performed at Lollapalooza in Grant Park Chicago, Illinois. 

&gt; On August 16, the first ever North American tour was announced with dates scheduled for Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York City. Read more on Last.fm.

RO at least has carry potential and even in the games he looks bad it is more due to the lanes playing bad. He also gets a more stable meta right now to help out lanes instead of having to rely on aggressive but squishy junglers while his team had not enough carries that could take over.

Piglet is pretty reliable as an ADC, but he also has his moments when he thinks ""I need to carry this alone"" and goes full ham.

Instead of fixing their problems (synergy, macro game, laning power) they bring in another player again that can only play with Inori, who is likely going to struggle in this jungle meta.

The gretzky era was part of the golden age of the ""goon"" (a low skill player who was on the ice to hit the other team at any opportunity, protect their own teammates, and throw down the gloves to fight when necessary)

Dave Semenko was Gretzkys goon for alot of his career, including most of his days with the Oilers.  They were almost always on the ice together.  If someone tried to hurt Gretzky, or even if they laid a big, clean hit on him, you can bet Semenko is gonna be punching you in the face for it.  

So basically yes, high skill hockey players get messed with all the time and Gretzky was absolutely no different..  But especially during that era, if you are laying the big hit, you BETTER be ready to defend yourself. 

ALSO, If you are doing things against the rules to hurt or slow down Gretzky, you are gonna get yourself a penalty and find your team down a man in a 5v4 for 2 minutes versus the greatest scorer of all time.  Not a situation you want to put your team in. ",nfl

8311,"I dunno about 30-40 years, putting such numbers is basically just guesswork.

But look at it another way:

You say 1 out of every 4 dollars is produced in the US. That means 3 out of 4 dollars aren't. Changes in that ""rest of the world"" thing are weighted 3x for every 1 of ours. That's a lot of money that could go to industrialization, commerce, research and development, etc.

In reality, that ""rest of the world"" is really just the EU plus a small number of other countries - Japan, China, India, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few more.

As he mentioned, last year 92 countries had growth rates above 4%. China and India were at 10%+, Brazil at 7.5%, South Korea at 6.1%. Even first world countries like Germany, Japan and Canada had higher growth rates than the US, which was number 117. And yet the US produced a 2.8% growth rate, which is pretty darn respectable for a mature economy.

So it's not like we're doing very poorly, it's just that many countries are doing a hell of a lot better. This is understandable, since they have a lot of room to grow; many started off with 3rd world status and many are still there.

But the net result is that the US share of all those things you mentioned, such as the 1 out of ever 4 dollars we produce, or the amount of military that cash can buy, all go down *as a fraction of the total world output*. And this can happen pretty damn fast.

More worrying to me than dollar amounts and number of military bases are things that I think are better predictors of future performance, such as:

1. Number of research papers we produce per year. This is **far** from keeping pace with the growth in the rest of the world.

2. The performance of American kids in math and science and basic reading comprehension skills, in which we placed 29th out of 31 of the top industrialized countries in the world.

3. Deteriorating infrastructure - roads and bridges which are not being built at a pace in keeping with population growth, which are not being kept in repair. Telecommunications in which we lag far behind many European and Asian countries.

Stuff like that has serious consequences if you're making predictions about the future, because it's your growth pipeline, it's what will fuel tomorrow's growth.

Again, nobody is saying the US has lost already, just that the current trend is a decline rather than maintaining the status quo or advancing. Yes, we ""control space"" as you said, but people looking at NASA today which just retired the shuttle, visited the moon 40 years ago and never went back since, continues to cut back for lack of funds, can't help but think that this is exactly what ""decline"" looks like. We had the whole market in space launches once along with the USSR. Today, commercial satellite launches are more likely to be through ESA or the Japanese, or the Indians.

I don't think this trend will go away, because really our massive dominance over the rest of the world was something of a fluke of history that gave us a huge lead over everyone else. Europe was the only competition, and it was crushed after WW2. Asia was coming out of the feudal/dark ages. You couldn't expect that sort of thing to last forever.",worldnews

8338,"We can argue semantics over whether or not Russia is a ""superpower"" - but they're still a large, powerful nation with nukes at their disposal.

Nations that could be defined with that statement haven't actively encroached on other other sovereign nations' territories for many decades now - this is definitely not a ""has it been done before"" question, and is very much a ""what is a normal thing that nations do now"" question.  Can you imagine Germany deciding to take some space in France and then shrugging to say ""everyone's done it""?

Plus, even if we're not talking ""all out nuclear war"", stopping Russia's [eastward expansion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-appears-taking-georgias-land-185005478.html) certainly seems like it would require war of some sort.

And he's a notable step down defensively and from a floor general/passing standpoint. Rubio has ways of making an offense click even if he's inefficient as a scorer (just look at offensive numbers with and without him for the pups over the last few years). Teague will not help others in the same way that Ricky could. It might be a slightly better fit but Teague is also significantly more expensive and Ricky has also been nothing but a consummate professional and teammate (I don't know Teague that well aside from his on-court accolades so I can't say either way with regards to him). So overall from a basketball standpoint, I think it's at best a lateral move at best but it required sending away a fan favorite and paying a lot more to get a middling 1st round pick at best. I know shooting is of high importance on this team considering the rest of the roster but I just don't like the move all things considered. That all being said, Thibs has earned himself quite a bit of equity this offseason in my book with the Butler trade so I'm hopeful that I'll be proven wrong about this and am trying to trust him despite my skepticism.

8378,"Full text of complaint: 

We represent 11 teams and 5/6ths of the countries from the South East Asian (SEA) region in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.

We are writing to protest the last-minute extraordinary rule change by Garena which has been announced only just now, after the regular summer seasons for our countries professional leagues have ended, that Vietnam will be awarded an unprecedented two spots in the upcoming GPL tournament in less than one month.  

While we do not deny the remarkable and triumphant showing put on by our brothers at MSI this year, we would like to point out they did not play under their banner of GAM nor did they play under the banner of their country, Vietnam.  They played under the banner of South East Asia (SEA.)  They were not just representing themselves nor just representing their country's league, they were representing our entire region as a whole and accordingly garnered the support and admiration of all us in doing so.  Their success awarded our region an extra slot at the 2017 worlds championship per the rules of the tournament published long before the MSI commenced.  

While we understand Garena wanting to reward Vietnam for their success; we object to the abrupt and arbitrary nature of this profound change and its effect on the upcoming premier tournament of our region.  If Garena wishes to implement a rule of this nature in the future, we would both understand and support its incorporation.  Yet, deciding in the midst of the competitive season, however seemingly justified, to change the rules in such a monumental fashion without reasonable or due notice (which we would argue would be before the start of the summer split) would be fundementally unfair.  It would be akin to Riot rewarding Korea by announcing, out of the blue, that it would be awarded 5 seeds at worlds based on previous performance.  While this would seem justifiable taken in isolation, there are reasons why this is not the case. An arbitrary and seemingly random rule change of this magnitude, made at the eleventh hour, would be almost universally rejected.

It is no secret that Vietnam is the most competitive country in our region.  For us lesser regions we saw the MSI result and reward as our opportunity to finally make a stand at the largest most storied and significant Esports tournament on the planet in the League of Legends World Championship.  Many of us invested increased resources and effort to take advantage of this opportunity.  Some of us spent significant amounts of money (especially for our region) on foreign boot camps and talent.  Many of our players and staff also doubled down on improving their craft, taking time away from their families and loved ones.  Now, at the cusp of achievment, we are told the competitive landscape will be significantly different tomorrow than what it was yesterday.  This is fundementally unfair to both our players and our efforts.  

Finally, while this rule appears to be designed to the benefit of the Vietnam Esports scene, already the most advanced in the region, it will have a significant chilling effect on the growth and professionalism of LOL Esports in our region as a whole, particularly in the places where it is needed most. 
We implore Riot to maintain the integrity of our league and recind this rule that significantly affects the competitive landscape of our league without fair and adequate prior notice.  We recognize we are small countries without the prior successes or financial backing of other regions.  Nevertheless, through their hard work and sacrifice, our players have earned the right to a stable, predictable, and above all else, fair, competition.

You could have looked at some of the other numbers and maybe come up with a more intelligent response.  For instance, he's one of two guys on the fWAR top 150 with less than 300 games, the other being Max Scherzer who in one less game only makes it to 134 as opposed to Kershaw's 54.

If you just looked at the guy in front of him, David Wells, you would have seen that it took him 660 games to accumulate as much fWAR as Kershaw did in more than half the time.

Then you could have synthesized that data internally and realized that if he made it to 54 in only 285 games then yeah, he's probably one of the best all time.  But that would have required you to do more than just look at a list and blindly accept what you saw so yeah, I can see why you didn't do it.",baseball

“Democracy is always presented as if it were incomplete, because democracy is not enough by itself,” says Macron, elaborating that there is always something missing in the democratic process; some sort of void.

“In French politics, this absence is the presence of a King, a King whom, fundamentally, I don’t think the French people wanted dead,”  “The Revolution dug a deep emotional abyss, one that was imaginary and shared: the King is no more!” According to Macron, since the Revolution France has tried to fill this void, most notably with Napoleon and then Charles de Gaulle, which was only partially successful. “The rest of the time,” said Macron, “French democracy does not manage to fill this void.”

Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class.

To me the response somewhat holds in how NA successfully found a better way to play around the map, simple as that. But the ""violence"" of how it has been done, and how bad EU looked, is imo due to unpreparation and EU teams lacking adaptation.

EU meta was more early pressure, shaping their ways through soem skimershes early, then snowball and take leads from there. NA was more quiet, not letting EU ways to create those picks from where they could snowball, but also group every time you can and create havocs once you're five, with a heavy heavy stress put on midlane. EU has been poor at controlling their sidelanes : NA easely have been shoving them and setting their collapse. Their have been many other factors, but basicly it came down to this : *EU has done nothing to keep NA away from their win conditions, while NA did kept EU from creating the picks they needed*.

It was a big mistake, but an avoidable one. I'm pretty sure EU could ahve trained other regions meta, they would have realized ""oh gragas jungle pick actually is something"" ""ok there is soemthing we are not doing quite right towards sidelane famring"" and would have put an answer to NA.

The whole exercise narrative was part of the misdirection sponsored by the sugar industry to do ANYTHING EXCEPT telling people to stop eating sugar products.

Not the funniest of the times for me. But i started to get a little grip, playing better with their help and eventually I even made the team. What's the point here?
I'm not saying that you are ""crying"" or something like that. When i started CS GO I never had problems with smurfs, because i learned how to play CS with them. And besides all the aim practice, demo watching, ect.. that you can get (and a lot of people here gave awesome advise in that chapter) for me there's two keys to go against a smurf:
First, mindset. You know they are better than you so start the game playing safe, not taking too much risks. This helps to build some confidence (and you really have to have a lot to go against them). Maybe they are just a guy having a awesome day. If you start to get frustated you will make a lot of mistakes and give them free frags. In the end of the day, we are all human.
Second, if you can't outaim them, just outsmart them. It's easier to say than to do, but if you start thinking the game you can mess with their heads. I started to play as a lurker with my friends because of that. It's almost impossible to lurk in MM as you need a team to do it properly, but if you find some off-angles, start review your demos to see when to push, or not to push, teasing them with some false info ect, you can get one or two kills that start to make them frustrated.

Also, gently and slowly lower the bird into the oil.  Don't drop it in and don't lower it quickly.

Since I wet brine, I have someone help me lower the bird in.  I took a broom handle and attached a hook at the center.  Then I get someone on the other end of the handle and we both get as far away from the oil as possible and lower the turkey in that way.

That stype as well as the use of transparent glazes helped instill this painting as one that would be copied for years to come. This one painting influences many that came after it. This singular painting set the tone for portrait paining in the 16th century.
The fascination with this painting isn't just a modern day occurrence. Napoleon had it in bed room. Also, we only have about 20 painting by Da Vinci. Compared to say 600 by Rembrandt and the 50 thousand of works of Picasso.

You look at Mona Lisa and you think:""there is nothing new here."" But that is because da Vinci's techniques influenced almost every other painter who cam after him.
In Monda Lisa da Vinci achieved the effect of the subject seeming alive, and included the effect of an aerial perspective for the background. The techniques seem common, almost cliche nowadays.
""The Storm"" was painted 400 years after Mona Lisa, yet Mona Lisa still stands up to it attesting to its timeless value.

8713,"Agreed:  Germ does win out, regardless of group size, if your goal is healing priority targets.

Spring Blossoms winning out on large raids is premised on you doing baseline raid maintenance.

  &amp;nbsp;  

In most cases, that's a job better left to a non-druid (presuming you have a diverse healing lineup).  Predictable debuff damage, however, is one of the niche places where druid priority healing actually does win out.  We saw similar strength from Germ last tier for Mr. Dreadlord as well - even before the Shoulders got buffed into usefulness and 4 piece became presumed.

  &amp;nbsp;  

Perhaps it would be useful to explain the current raid healing meta - less so for the people posting here (most of the frequent posters seem capable of answering the questions) but more for the people lurking or just getting into raid healing.

Competitive raid healing this expansion has - outside countering specific elements like those mentioned here - been dominated by the model of the Druid-Shaman-Paladin triumvirate.  While it is adjusted to the fight mechanics, the basic segregation of duties for that lineup is fairly straightforward. 

The Shaman is there to provide weird shaman cooldowns - SLT, Ahnk totem for the spare brez, etc - and handle priority spot healing.  

The Paladin handles the bulk of the baseline tank healing and supplements spot healing.

The Druids (generally 2) handle baseline raid maintenance and supplement the tank healing with HoTs. (The exact line between priority spot healing and raid maintenance is somewhat murky and fight dependent, but you get the idea).

  &amp;nbsp;  

***In practice, with that class lineup, this segregation of duties happens almost automatically as a function of the class kits***  This holds even with slight variations in the specs involved.

  &amp;nbsp;  

You can readily slot other healers into those roles: you often had a disc priest instead of the 2nd druid until they got nerfed in EN and a bunch of people jumped ship.  A holy priest can slot into any of those roles fairly well.  Mistweaver slots well into the Shaman's healing niche (though they really still need more of a buff), but doesn't have SLT (which many raid consider near-mandatory because of its unique effect).

  &amp;nbsp;  

This lineup is not mandatory.  It is, however, more or less the baseline for the healing meta at the moment.  If you are running a radically different healing lineup (not merely changing a class out for a similar class in the same role, but having a class do something significantly different than is implied in its role in that lineup), much of the advice that is based implicitly on this segregation of duties will need to change.  

For example, consider a Disc/Disc/Druid/Druid lineup.
In that lineup, the disc priests would handle raid maintenance and the druids handling priority healing and Tank healing.  That radically changes druid talent selection and spell distribution. ",wow

""First Hand Experience In Second Hand Love"" from *From Here To Eternity*  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/85bde6d16cb34800c86670001cfa3615.png) [album cover](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5404caaae3ce4233c2b4a67177cf8d80.png)  

&gt; Giorgio Moroder (born Hansjörg Moroder on April 26, 1940 in Ortisei, Italy) is an Italian record producer, songwriter and performer, whose groundbreaking work with synthesizers during the 1970s was a significant influence on new wave, techno and electronic music in general. Particularly well known are Donna Summer's disco hits produced by Moroder, including ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""I Feel Love"". Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees.

&gt; Often collaborating with lyricist Pete Bellotte, Moroder scored a number of hits in his own name including ""Son Of My Father"" in 1972 and ""From Here to Eternity"" in 1977 under the name Giorgio, and in the following year releasing ""Chase"", the theme from the film Midnight Express and sold well elsewhere. All were hits in the UK. The full movie score for Midnight Express won him his first Academy Award for best film score in 1978.

&gt; In 1985, Moroder worked with Phil Oakey, frontman of the popular synthpop group, The Human League, to make the album Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder. The following year, Moroder collaborated with his protege Harold Faltermeyer (of ""Axel F."" fame) and lyricist Tom Whitlock to create the score for the popular film Top Gun (1986), with the most noteworthy hit being the Berlin classic, ""Take My Breath Away"", which went on to become a huge hit for the group.

&gt; He also scored other popular films in the 1980s including American Gigolo, Flashdance, The NeverEnding Story, Thief of Hearts, Electric Dreams, Scarface and Cat People(in collaboration with David Bowie). The latter score has recently regained popularity due to its use in the popular computer game Grand Theft Auto III. Moroder's ""From Here To Eternity"" and ""The Chase"" were also used in the Sony PSP game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. 

&gt; In 1984, Moroder compiled a new restoration and edit of the famous silent film Metropolis and provided a new modern rock-and-roll soundtrack to the film. 
His song ""Tears"" was sampled and used as the basis of the DJ Shadow song ""Organ Donor"" on his 1996 album Endtroducing......

&gt; On September 20, 2004 Moroder was honored at the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony, held in New York, when he was inducted for his many outstanding achievements and contributions as producer. In 2005, he was given the title of Commendatore by Azeglio Ciampi.

&gt; In 2005, a great deal of his work (including the Cizeta-Moroder supercar he co-produced in the mid 90s with Claudio Zampolli) was used in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, and was the entire playlist of the Flashback FM radio station.

&gt; Giorgio Moroder is one of the numerous composers interested in writing the theme tune of the 2008 Bejing Olympic Games. This is not the first theme song Moroder composed for the Olympic games. ""Hand in Hand"" was regarded as the best ever Olympic theme song for the 1988 Seoul Olympics by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch.

&gt; Moroder contributed to Daft Punk's 2013 studio album Random Access Memories, admitting that he had been a fan of their song ""One More Time"" before working with the group. His voice and story is featured on the album's track ""Giorgio by Moroder"". On the track he states, ""My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio."" Read more on Last.fm.

In the specific case of Roadhog, yes, it hurt a lot.

In the case of Doomfist being able to catapult himself across the map in a matter of seconds when that was clearly not what was intended (especially with how fast the nerf came, not even leaving PTR before being hit), is not. You can still launch yourself 40m on a 4sec cooldown by just holding space on a full rocket fist charge.

&gt;Also, im 90% sure you mean he felt better to play against, cause no hero feels better after a nerf, you just got better luck in those few games you played if thats so. 

No, I mean he genuinely felt better post-nerf. Much more controlled, much less ""I'm gonna launch myself into the abyss now"".

I agree he's easy to counter, but that was the case pre-nerf. It's no easier to counter post-nerf. The ~9m shorter range on a full charge means almost nothing when all you had (and have) to do is shoot at his huge hitbox. Flying around like Genji on steroids in 'Total Mayhem' is ridiculous.

It's not even a third of his mobility like you keep saying. ~9m is close to a third of ONE of his abilities, yes, but you can make it another ~24m with his other abilities. And if you hold jump while charging, you can easily make 40 on a charge.

Previous full charge: 30m

Jump-skip: +20m

Shift+E combo: +24m

Total: 74m

9m off 74m is not a crippling, gutting nerf. It's a much-deserved, and probably previously planned change. You can still go 65m with a combo of all three, on a ~7sec cooldown.",Overwatch

Honestly, I was obnoxious about even architecture because of her. Because anything aesthetic and not structural to her is garbage architecture which. I bet the vast majority of architects who have read her (most of whom probably think art and architecture aren't 100% disconnected like Roask) can't fucking stand that book.

&gt;I've developed a pretty solid hatred for the Oilers. Mostly because I'm from Edmonton, and let me tell ya, the amount of ""fans"" that popped up and bought a shitty orange McDavid jersey and wore it around was unbelievable. It was like the Oilers have been everyone's team for the past few decades or some shit, but nope, everyone pops up, pretends like they watched the team since before last Tuesday, posts a couple of pictures of Rogers Place watch parties on social media, and pisses everyone and their dog off, but nobody says anything because everyone else is on the bandwagon too. I get that the team is good again and that's fun and all, but fuck if it wasn't shoved down everyone's throat for a month and a half. It wasn't unbearable or anything, but fuck, you'd think people who haven't watched hockey in their lives have better ways to spend their money than a jersey they'll wear twice, probably not realizing Adidas was dropping new threads on us two months later anyways. And then they'll all chirp the shit out of me for being a Wings fan because all of a sudden we're bad and they're good now, apparently the ultimate trump card. Yay.

&gt;Then there's the whole mismanagement draft lottery thing. I'm not a huge fan of the draft lottery like it was, but the Oilers singlehandedly ruined the draft lottery for every other team because of their idiotic management. Four first overalls later, and idiotic management which sent the city into a collective state of angst, and the NHL changes the rules. Who loses from that? Colorado, who got 4th overall despite being historically terrible; Buffalo, who got Eichel, but whiffed on other great talents; Vancouver, who are in a permanent state of 5th overall; Arizona, who haven't had jack shit compared to other teams in the draft, and just about every other team near the top of the draft lottery. Who doesn't lose from the rules specifically made to limit the Oilers? Well, you fuckin guessed it, it's the Oil. They just ride off into the sunset with Mc fuckin Jesus and continue to monopolize generational talent along with the Penguins, who deserve their own angsty rant that I'll save for another time.

&gt;On top of that, how can you cheer for some of the guys in the Oilers organization? Kevin Lowe ""knows a thing or two about winning,"" but helped drive the team and the city's collective morale into the ground. Darryl Katz has some weird sexual lawsuit, and strong armed the city into building the arena over the threat of dumping the Oilers in Seattle. Arena is nice, but fuck, even hardcore Oilers fans agree that taxpayer dollars shouldn't really be going to an expenditure which benefits that goof above all else. Like, fuck, his team was so bad, that the city of Edmonton basically collectively adopted his son when we saw him march up to the draft stage for a top pick every year. It was like watching your own child grow up or some shit man. Katz alone should probably keep any non-Oilers fan around here from liking the Oilers, so I guess I'll leave it at that until the next time I get into a Hall/Larsson debate and take the edgy, indefensible position that the Oilers maybe could've gotten more value in that deal. Yay once again.

&gt;Disclaimer: the Oilers fans I know would probably laugh at this, hopefully I don't pull too many strings, it's all for fun boys, even though I do really not like the Oil

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/58549b9a07db4fcdb5b8d397aadacfae.png)  

&gt; The Jacksons (formerly known as The Jackson 5, The Jackson Five, The Jackson 5ive or abbreviated as J5) was an American popular music quintet from Gary, Indiana, USA. The group, active from 1964 to 1990, regularly played from a repertoire of R&amp;B, soul, funk, and later disco. Considered ""one of the biggest phenomenons in pop music"" during the early 1970s, the Jackson 5 are also notable for launching the career of their lead singer, Michael Jackson.

&gt; The primary members of the group were all the sons of Katherine and Joseph Jackson: Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Michael Jackson, and Randy Jackson (see Randy &amp; The Gypsys). Joseph Jackson formed the band in 1964 and served as its manager, with Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and unrelated youths Reynaud Jones and Milton Hite comprising its original lineup. Within a year, Michael and Marlon joined the band, and Michael became lead singer as the group developed a following in the eastern and midwestern United States during the mid-1960s. Signed to the Motown label from 1969 to 1975, and to CBS Records (as ""The Jacksons"") from 1975 until their disbanding in 1990, the Jackson 5 were one of the most popular groups of the era and became the first recording act to have their first four major label singles (I Want You Back, ABC, The Love You Save, and I'll Be There) reach the top of the American charts. Several future singles, among them ""Mama's Pearl"", ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" and ""Dancing Machine"", were Top 5 pop hits and number-one hits on the R&amp;B singles chart. Most of the early hits were written and produced by a specialized songwriting team known as The Corporation™; later Jackson 5 hits were crafted chiefly by Hal Davis.

&gt; While not the first act considered a ""boy band"", The Jackson 5 is one of the earliest examples of the type as it is defined today: five adolescents specifically packaged and marketed by a record label for crossover pop success. Upon their departure from Motown for CBS in 1975, the Jacksons, were forced to change their name and trade Jermaine (who remained at Motown) for Randy. The group took control of their songwriting, production, and image, and their success continued into the 1980s with hits such as ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" and ""State of Shock"", and a highly successful 1984 Victory tour. The Jacksons officially disbanded in 1990.

&gt; History

&gt; Early works

&gt; The Jacksons were a working-class family from Gary, Indiana. Katherine, being a Jehovah's Witness, raised the children as such, while their father, Joe, was not of that faith. Their father, a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&amp;B band called ""The Falcons"" with his brother Luther, was a strict disciplinarian. Many of the Jackson children recall being severely beaten by Joe for misbehaving.

&gt; The children found an outlet in music, with elder brothers Jackie (born Sigmund Esco Jackson, 1951), Tito (born Toriano Jackson, 1953), and Jermaine (b. 1954) borrowing their father's guitar without his permission and playing along to the radio. Younger brothers Marlon (b. 1957) and Michael (b. 1958) were allowed to watch as long as they did not tell. Joseph eventually discovered that the older three boys were playing his guitar when one of the strings broke. Although he was furious at first, Joseph realized the boys had talent and began making plans to create a musical act for them.

&gt; In 1965, Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine began performing around the Gary area with two neighborhood children, Milford Hite (on drums) and Reynaud Jones (on keyboards), in a group called The Jackson Brothers. Joe Jackson served as the manager, at first only part-time, and then eventually quitting his job at the steel mill. Jermaine sang lead and played bass, and Tito played guitar.

&gt; In 1966, younger brothers Marlon and Michael, joined the group as its tambourine and bongo players. Already showing talent as a singer and dancer, Michael replaced Jermaine as lead vocalist by mid-1967. Shirley Cartman, Tito's junior high orchestra teacher, noticed the group's talents and served as an early mentor to the group, by then calling itself The Jackson Five.

&gt; During this period, the boys toured Indiana extensively, and after winning a major local talent show in 1966 with a rendition of The Temptations' ""My Girl"", led by Michael, they began playing professional gigs in Chicago, Illinois and across the mid-eastern U.S. Many of these gigs were in a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the ""chitlin' circuit"", and the young kids sometimes had to open for strip teasers and other adult acts in order to earn money.

&gt; Shirley Cartman got the Jackson Five a record deal with Gordon Keith's local Steeltown label, and the group began making their first recordings in 1967. Their first single, ""Big Boy"", became a regional hit. During this period, Johnny Jackson (no relation) on drums and Ronnie Rancifer on keys replaced Milford Hite and Reynaud Jones.

&gt; The Jackson Five had a number of admirers in their early days, including Sam &amp; Dave, who helped the group secure a spot in the famous Amateur Night competition at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The group won the August 13, 1967 competition during the Amateur Night showdown at the Apollo, impressing Motown Records artist Gladys Knight of The Pips. Knight recommended the group to Motown chief Berry Gordy, but Gordy, who already had teenager Stevie Wonder on his roster, was hesitant to take on another child act because of the child labor laws and other problems involved.

&gt; 
The Jackson Five's sound was influenced by many of the biggest stars of the 1960s, especially including family funk bands Sly &amp; the Family Stone and The Isley Brothers, soul pioneer Marvin Gaye, doo-wop boy band Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, and soul shouters like Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, Stevie Wonder and James Brown. At the time of their early success, soul and funk stars, especially coming from Motown Records, were among the most popular musicians; Motown had launched the careers of dozens of the decade's biggest stars, most notably Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes.

&gt; Influences

&gt; From these sources, The Jackson Five developed many of their vocal arrangement styles and dance movements. The group's multi-lead vocal style was inspired by that of The Family Stone, while young Michael adapted Jackie Wilson and James Brown's impassioned singing and dancing styles into his own.

&gt; Joining Motown

&gt; By 1968, the Jackson 5 were a headlining act for the All Star Floor Show at Chicago's The Guys' and Gals' Cocktail Lounge and Restaurant. From July 12 - 27, 1968, the Jackson 5 opened for Motown group Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers at Chicago's Regal Theater. Taylor was also very impressed with the boys, and he decided to make the commitment to bring them to Detroit and Motown. Joseph and the Jackson Five stayed on the floor of Bobby Taylor's Detroit apartment the night of July 22, while Taylor and Motown executive Suzanne de Passe arranged for the Jackson Five to audition for the label.

&gt; On July 23, the Jackson Five had their Motown audition, for which they performed James Brown’s then current hit ""I Got the Feelin’"". Berry Gordy was not in attendance, but the audition was videotaped and sent to him in Los Angeles. Gordy's initial reluctance to sign the group disappeared when he finally saw the boys perform. Gordy decided to sign the Jackson Five to Motown, and hosted a party at his Detroit mansion on November 25, 1968 to introduce them to the Motown staff and stars.

&gt; Motown began negotiations to buy out the Jackson Five's Steeltown contract, completing the deal in March 1969. By the summer, Bobby Taylor began producing the group's first recordings at Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. recording studio in Detroit. The early Taylor-produced Jackson Five records were all covers of both contemporary hits and Motown-standards, including Sly &amp; the Family Stone's ""Stand!"" and their famous rendition of The Miracles' ""Who's Lovin' You"", written by Smokey Robinson.

&gt; In mid-August 1969, Gordy moved the Jackson Five and Joseph to California, and he and Suzanne de Passe began the process of grooming them as the label's next big act, while the rest of the family remained in Gary. While looking for a house in California, Joseph, Jermaine, Tito, and Jackie lived with Berry Gordy, while Michael and Marlon lived with Motown star Diana Ross. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt;She shouldn't have even been in the US but low and behold AG Lynch waived her expired visa

No, the DoJ (not lynch) gave her a parole letter to come to the united states to defend Prevezon Russian company involved in money laundering.  She requested an extension after that permission expired, but that was denied AFAIK.  By all accounts, it looks like she was just in the US illegally.  Lynch didn't do shit.

&gt;Veselnitskaya’s visa for U.S. entry was denied, but she received special permission — in what is known as a “parole letter” — to come to New York specifically to defend Prevezon and Katsyv. She said in a court statement, however, that when she tried to reenter the United States, she was detained at London’s Heathrow Airport and “unjustifiably subjected to a strip search, for no apparent reason.” She eventually received permission to come to the United States to continue her work for Prevezon.

-

&gt;That set the stage for Veselnitskaya to be in New York City in June 2016, where a hearing related to Prevezon case was being held in federal court.

How desperate.

&gt;then a week later she was walking the halls of congress and front and center along with Obama's ambassador to Russia during a congressional hearing on Russian adoption laws.

Do you know whose hearing she was attending?  None other than Congressman Rohrabacher - who she met with in Germany, who echoed her talking points about the anti-money laundering sanctions on Russia.  The guy named as being paid by Putin by fellow republican McCarthy in private recordings.

&gt; And ads advertise anywhere people go online and there is proof people go to these sites ergo advertisers will advertise there.  

Bullshit.   Nobody is advertising on a pirate movie streaming site.  

Posting an article about how many takedown notices are being issued doesn't exactly support the idea piracy is still a problem.  I contend it never was.

No matter how much of a dick some precious little pirate wants to be, they can't defy gravity.  Bandwidth can't be copied.  It costs money, and there's no way to monetize piracy.  Case closed.

9368,"Absolutely. You are correct that Porzingis is a better 3-pt shooter. Personally, I believe sometimes stats should be used to mislead if the overall point is valid. In this case, I mainly want to portray how Aldridge is in fact good offensively (despite his recent WCF performance) and similar to Porzingis despite public opinion having turned against him during the playoffs.

That being said, I actually do agree with you that Porzingis is offensively on par and honestly was more impactful than Aldridge last season. They're certainly very close in terms of prodcution.

I also agree that KP is a good rim protector and an excellent shot blocker (one of the league's best lol). However, when he steps out to the perimeter his slow foot speed (not relative to size but to the league in general) and overall awkwardness makes him an easy guy to blow by when he gets switched out there ([old clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVIlUedp-Tw)). Even with a bit of added weight this season, LMA is much more comfortable stepping out to shadow a guy before the rest of the defense recovers. He also plays within the defensive scheme well and can reliably rim protect when needed (though Pau does that most of the time). I just think Porzingis seems like he's trying to emulate Gobert without the same polish and skills, whereas LMA is closer to a Paul Millsap type of versatile defender who can play weak side shot blocker. Imo, the latter is much more rare and valuable in the NBA today. There are plenty of bootleg Goberts to go around the league; hell, even Pau was a pretty solid rim protector if you go buy the numbers. For that reason, I see KP as being good at a easily replaceable skill, and LMA as being very good at a less easily replaceable skill. To me, that's a huge difference and is why I think LMA is better than KP and even Kevin Love. 

With all that being said, KP is a beast and will almost certainly be better next year playing in an actual offensive scheme. But for this past year only, it's LMA.",nba

While they certainly collaborated, most of their best stuff was written by one or the other. It's just that all their songs are credited to Lennon/McCartney no matter who wrote what, because of their publishing deal. Hey Jude was all Paul, Strawberry Fields Forever was all John etc.

&gt;extremely talented players who didn't rely on session musicians except for orchestras and instruments that they couldn't play themselves

They used plenty of session musicians, string sections, brass sections, Indian musicians etc when it suited them. Apart from Billy Preston, their producer George Martin played a lot on their recordings, as well as writing arrangements and solos. Some of their tunes don't even have any Beatles playing instruments on them (Eleanor Rigby, She's Leaving Home, Good Night). I don't think its fair to say that their music was limited by their own abilities.

&gt;Revolver was a more folksy album, they were pretty much trying to emulate Bob Dylan's big shift in 1965

I'm not sure what this means. Revolver is the first album that they made knowing that they'd never have to play any of it live, so they went to town with a bunch of different styles, but I don't really hear much folk influence on that album. Dylan went to rock and roll from folk in '65.

There's practically no situation where I think harem romance is better written or developed compared to normal romance, in fact I'd even go as far as to say that (nearly) every harem romance would be better as a one on one romance with proper development compared to the split development in a harem. The romantic conflict brought by a harem is rarely something that can't be replicated with a love triangle or minor love rival, and the comedy that a harem brings is often pretty specific ""harem"" comedy, that is only funny if you specifically like harem comedy. Stuff like falling on boobs or panty shots isn't good general humor. And even the harems that are praised are often significantly different than a standard harem. When a genre's best examples are subversions, something is probably wrong with the genre. I think harems are honestly close to being just objectively bad. ",anime

Wether or not he should oneshotkill 400 health tanks with it, you can have your opinion on this. As a Zarya &amp; Orisa main I actually do not have a problem with that, considering the abilities these two characters have. But I also wouldnt mind Hanzo getting a redesign in general to be a little less nieche.  
  
Roadhog was a zone control meatbag dps tank. His role was: Walk into his area carelessly and he will oneshot you, approach carefully and you get to farm ult freely for a few seconds. Blizzard reconsidered because probably for the very casual players he was a pretty frustrating character to deal with, the loss of control, the oneshot, the heals, the tankiness and the teamfight ultimate, it FEELS like too much for some even when it maybe actually isnt. I am a little disappointed that Blizzard touched him without having a more clear role for him in mind, sure making him more of a dps and less wonky, thats fine, but he just doesnt feel that elegant right now.

Anybody that couldn't afford it got it for free. Nobody in the US didn't get it if they couldn't pay for it.  Not a single person. And before you go ahead and say ""well, don't those costs get passed on to the consumer?"" No, they don't.  Firstly, pharmaceutical costs are among the lesser costs in American health care spending. Why? Drugs are modular and can have economics similar to software. Doctors actually account for most of the cost yet people are reluctant to talk about that and doctors are extremely reluctant to take pay cuts. Secondly, think for just a moment about how insignificant the costs for a drug that serves 500 people are. Estimates pegged it at less than $100 million. Compare that to a staggering $500 billion for healthcare expenditures.

&gt; Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&amp;#039;s Republic has announced plans for a new, federal state to replace the current Ukraine.

&gt; In a statement published on the rebel-aligned Donetsk News Agency, the DNR leader Zakharchenko said that the new state would aspire to include not only the areas under insurgent control but also the rest of Ukraine.

&gt; Representatives from the self-declared &amp;quot;People&amp;#039;s Republics&amp;quot; of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine had agreed to &amp;quot;Declare the establishment of a new state, which is the successor of Ukraine,&amp;quot; said Zakharchenko.

&gt;She already got two buffs in a row that left people wondering what the hell she got them for since she was already fine, and you want a third one?

So it is a very tiny buff that is basically a quality of life improvement nothing more. She is fine as in ""not trash"". Orianna and syndra and multiple other champs literally do everything lux does 10 times better and are less reliant on your team not feeding and do not need everything to work out perfectly. They also have way more going for them. Both can dish out more damage in a fight especially more consistent damage because if you miss one q it only has a few second cooldown anyways so it's not a huge deal. If lux misses her skills in a fight it basically makes her useless due to her high cooldowns. You need to have everything work out perfectly to do the same shit that an orianna or syndra can do while missing half your stuff. There is a reason lux is a rare sight above gold elo and basically never seen above diamond 5. 


&gt;No, they can't. They use their main source of damage, while Lux keeps her binding and ultimate, and they still need to use 2-3 skills to clear a wave.
With what I said above, they definitely don't use less mana when they're using 2-3 skills.

Yes they absolutely can. Syndra with her first back around level 5 with lost chapter can twoshot caster minions with her q. Go try it out in practice tool. With 100 ap around level 9 (so midgame) she can oneshot them. Lux with lost chapter at level 5 leaves caster minions at half hp with one e so you need to all auto them once. At the same ap as syndra at level 9 at the same time she leaves the caster minions at this super annoying 5 hp status that i talked about in my post. You will never have to use more than 2 qs with syndra or ziggs to kill casters. And even when you use 2 q's they still cost less mana and are faster than lux e. As soon as you get a decent amount of ap with syndra or ziggs you will always oneshot the caster minions with a q. With lux this often is not the case even when you already have morellos. Also you say they use their main source of damage while lux doesn't. Syndra and ziggs both use only q, both have very short cd. They both still have w, e and ult which all do a lot of damage. Lux is left with q (which doesn't do a lot of damage early on and his really high cd) and ult which is difficult to hit without q. 


&gt;Not exclusive to Lux, so why should she get something because when literally every other champion in the game, according to you, shouldn't?

I didn't necessarily say no other champ should get this treatment but i am not aware of any where it is this annoying. At least not the ones that fill the same role as her.


&gt;Oh yeah, let's give a third undeserved buff to a champion that's already between fine and strong.
As I mentioned before, people were already wondering why she got a needless buff, much less a second. Both buffs ended up being assumed by many to be to jack up Elementalist Lux sales.

I am not really gonna repeat myself here. Lux is outclassed in her role by several other champs that do everything she does better. That is fact. A small buff like this would not be unjustified nor would it break her balancing.

Hey, [here's the fucking case file, read it yourself. Relevant excerpts below because judging by your ""manchildren"" horseshit, you're probably both too lazy to read it, and unwilling to read anything that might change what you already think.](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2010/2010abpc122/2010abpc122.html?resultIndex=3)

&gt;She described herself having a sister with young children and another younger sister and brother. She told Hoffart on being questioned by him that she used to be an assistant buyer in Ontario and now she was “just finding a new place and other things”. JVV admitted that she had given the accused that answer as she did not want him to know that she was a young girl and she avoided further questions on that topic.

&gt;The accused specifically asked, (not relying on her web profile), at 7:40:31 on December 28th 2008, “Okay-I really need to ask this...How old are you?” JVV replied “y?” and the accused typed “I think I read you were 20?” to which JVV replied “Ya”- the accused “Okay - I just needed to know. If you were younger there’s no way in hel (sic) I’d be saying this :-p” and JVV replied “That’s good to know”. JVV acknowledged in cross-examination about this exchange, that she believed that if she told the accused she was fifteen she thought the conversations with him would stop and she liked them so she did what she could to keep them going.

&gt;  In perpetuation of the myth regarding her age, the complainant in her messages made reference to the fact that she was in a relationship with a man “twenty eight” and ongoing conversations with other men - “there’s three guys ‘breathing down my back’ to see me”. She made reference to cuddling up to “my beloved Mr.Bear” in the midst of a flirtatious exchange regarding her need for comfort as she was, at the same time as typing online, watching a scary movie and discussing a love poem sent to her by the accused. However, she then suggested “switching him (Mr. Bear) for the accused - a flirtatious or sexual turn on the use of the teddy bear, not a childish reference to still playing with teddy bears. She described herself as liking Tchaikovsky and listening to the Nutcracker in another exchange. The other men with whom she was conversing were described by her as being very disrespectful and sexually suggestive. She elicited considerable sympathy and indignation on her behalf from the accused, which she admitted to liking. Her discussions with him about her relationships involved a description of some that ended badly due to “being away from each other and drifting apart”. While she used type-written slang and text abbreviations and emoticons extensively, she was a poor speller. She recounted a story regarding a past relationship where “a couple of years ago I was sneaking out of my ex’s downstairs window ...”.  In another posting JVV described going out to get drunk and smoking. All of these references were consistent with her being the stated age of twenty. There were no references to parental supervision, school attendance, friendships or other young age appropriate activities, financial dependency or other youthful circumstances.

&gt;The accused asked JVV for a picture, “What do you look like?” and she appeared to have trouble posting one a number of times, then finally got a blurry one up which showed her wearing a bikini top and pants, but where her face was indistinct. A few days later he specifically asked her “what do you do anyway? I’ve never asked.” JVV did not provide that information, she just typed “nope” and “No specifics” and the accused backed off. He expressed that he was respectful of JVV’s need for privacy (in internet conversations). Eventually the accused asked to meet JVV sometime over a cup of coffee. She replied that she was very shy and then agreed but stated, “I mean we can, u know,..be together but not in this house - she would kill me”. The accused inquired, “Who’s she?”, and JVV answered “the person I’m staying with” and said “ u cant ask too many questions” - and “just to let u know, I really want to but im really nervous so ill be shy at first k?”  Before they made specific arrangements to meet, the accused gave her information in case she wanted to leave a note - “just in case”. He gave her his full name, address, phone number and vehicle description and licence plate. While the instructions for meeting were for him to pick her up at a gas station on the main road of the town, he did not think that odd as he had never been to her town and her arrangement to meet at a landmark made it easier to find her. The late hour was indicative of their mutual like of spontaneous activities. He did not think it was due to her need to sneak out. He also believed that meeting out of the house was to avoid disruption to JVV’s roommate. The complainant testified that she never knew much about the accused and particularly that she never knew his last name.

It seems like the guy actually gave a shit about making sure she was 20, and she went pretty far out of her way to keep him convinced that she was.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/75c37c7bef574d9d9137fa9ee4668e7e.png)  

&gt; The momentum has been building for years, but now the time is finally ripe for Arkarna to emerge with a bang back onto the world's stage.

&gt; Arkarna, An outfit so ahead of their time, that the svengali behind the project, precocious engineering prodigy Ollie Jacobs, has been spending years perfecting his craft, working with the likes with Leftfield (mixing their seminal album Leftism), The Prodigy and Madonna rather than having his own name in lights.

&gt; His band first hit the scene in 1997 with the critically-acclaimed, platinum-selling debut album Fresh Meat, but after touring the world to thousands of fans, Ollie became disillusioned with the way major labels wanted to mould him, so went underground to make the kind of music that satisfied his soul - albeit for other artists.

&gt; Fast-forward a decade, and Ollie finally found a collaborator to meet his exacting creative remit in his quest to re-launch the vision for the band.

&gt; Step forward talented guitarist and songwriter Matt Hart. For the past three years, the pair have hunkered down in their north west London studio and now, they've finally completed the incendiary, ground-breaking album that they know will propel them to the forefront of today's music scene. Yes, Arkarna are back to claim their space on the dancefloor, moshpit and in discerning music lovers' record collections the planet over. No-one else sounds quite like Arkarna.

&gt; When Ollie and Matt first met, it was electric - literally. Ollie, a programmer and singer, who's been a producer at his dad's Queen's Park studio Rollover since he was 14, was on the lookout for someone to take Arkarna's electro-pop sound to the next level.

&gt; Then he met Matt, who left a lasting impression in more ways than one. A smalltown West Sussex boy with a big dream, Matt had studied music classically since his childhood, but recovering from a life-threatening bout of illness aged 15, he started playing rock guitar. Later, while studying a degree in music at the prestigious Goldsmiths University in London, he saw an ad for auditions at Rollover, and, ever ambitious, went for it.

&gt; Matt explains: ""When I went to meet Ollie, I was in a rush, it was chucking down with rain, and I didn't put a bin liner on my amplifier. I tried to mop it down when I got there, but when they plugged me in to play, it gave everyone an electric shock. So before I'd even played, I'd electrocuted half the band, haha.""

&gt; Ollie enthuses: ""When I saw Matt playing, I knew instantly that he had a magic about him that I needed in my creative journey. We ended up working on high end sessions work together, with the likes of Boyzone. But when I started dreaming up some new Arkarna material, Matt was a natural progression so it just developed from that.""

&gt; Now a genuine song-writing partnership, the self-confessed knobtwiddler and balls-out rocker were a marriage made in heaven and the rest will be electrifying history - but year zero is 2010.

&gt; Arkarna have already made global inroads over the past few years, soundtracking Levis ads in the States and, right now, they're the sound of one of the biggest-selling alcoholic drinks in Russia.

&gt; Arkarna's single So Little Time was also the theme tune to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's TV show in the US of the same name. On top of that, track House On Fire has featured on legendary US comedy Friends, The OC and the soundtrack for movie Batman And Robin - more importantly, they've even been played on the caff stereo in EastEnders...

&gt; But the past is merely an extra super-powered spring for the turbocharged launchpad that is Arkarna's crowd-pleasing new long player.

&gt; A bold, cerebral but ultimately rump-moving melange of beat-stoked, tune-drenched, emotionally-charged songs, the new album may be seen by some as their comeback, but in many ways, it sees Arkarna wiping the slate clean, whilst not alienating their vast existing fanbase in Southeast Asia and Australia.

&gt; Not only that, the catchy-as-swine-flu debut single from their new album has been mastered by the legendary Chris Gehringer from Sterling Sound, who's recently polished releases from the likes of Yeasayer, Rihanna, La Roux, Keisha and 3Oh!3.

&gt; And that's before you even consider the video, which has been directed by promo geniuses DuckEye, who've previous made videos for the likes of The Fallout Trust, Zero 7, Sigur Ros, and Clayhill - and, without giving too much away, it's set to be a fruity worldwide internet sensation...

&gt; But back to the new album, and with a public appetite voracious for the likes of Pendulum and Muse, Arkarna's unique take on cinematic, BPM-savvy, electronic, stadium-friendly rock with killer melodies is perfectly timed to explode onto the dancefloors, festivals and arenas across the globe - as Matt explains, ""We fall into and cross so many of the genres that are really popular now, but we've still got our own thing going on, we always have. We've got to be true to our sound.""

&gt; Matt elaborates: ""The Arkarna sound is so distinct - no-one sounds like us. We've always thought it was important to incorporate a lot of musical flavours from the old stuff, especially, the dance elements, but time moves on and music progresses, it evolves, so it's important that you evolve with it. And that's what we've done.""

&gt; Ollie adds, pertinently: ""I think it's what naturally comes out and we sound completely different to anyone else - we're not a copy. It's got history behind it, but it's organic and not contrived. And it gets asses on the dancefloor!""

&gt; And what of those lyrics?

&gt; Ollie explains: ""They're just about what's going on inside my head, quite insular. They work on different levels though - I like people to take their own meanings from them. Sometimes they're not meant to make sense. But yes, a lot of them are about love, because it's one of those things you can't help writing about because it hurts like a physical thing sometimes and everyone can relate to it.""

&gt; Matt gives us an extra insight: ""A lot of it is beneath the surface, you can't take them at face value, they're more cerebral and intelligent, you have to read into them. It's not just cliches - they're more arty, less literal, more abstract. But they're all from experience.""

&gt; Preparations are already underway for the Arkarna live onslaught - for which we can only warn you to limber up or face serious injury. As well as a full-on, aural assault with a full live band, Matt and Ollie are also rehearsing their new set acoustically.

&gt; Matt elaborates: ""It will be quite a big surprise the acoustic stuff, as we're making it completely unique. When it sounds as strong as it does acoustically, it's going to blow everyone away with the full band. You can hide behind so much when it's electronic. It's the meaning of the song and the tunes that ultimately carry it and make it a success.""

&gt; But whether you're experiencing them acoustically, with the full-on live experience or via the new album, all we can say is, get ready for the kind of musical therapy that only Arkarna can provide. Everybody needs it... Read more on Last.fm.

I'm also rewatching the series simultaneously as the new episodes come out and honestly the change is shocking. I'm up to season 3 again and comparing those episode with these new ones, i would say the biggest change is the sets. The show used to take you places through the scenes. There was movement among real on-location sets with real extras and props and now every scene is static in front of a greenscreen and every shot feels uninspired.   
Remember when Gren, Sam and Ed were talking while peeling potatoes and walking about the camp with camp life happening in the background? Now it's Tyrian standing still talking to other people standing still in front of a greenscreen inside a dark room, the same room we have seen before with Stannis which just doesnt compare.

You could flip and readjust your bottom 6 with young talent on cheep contracts and good prospects from outside the traditional nhl talent pool (NCAA and Euro/Russian leagues for example). Instead you're advocating for retaining an aging defenseman who could get seriously injured or just flat out choose to retire in the next year or so. 46 points is really good but I wouldn't say that justifies his spot on the team when you could easily dump that into offensive depth alone and at the very least double your point production for that given $5 mil of cap. Also, I'm not assuming his point production drops in half, but you see it with older defenseman, they get slower, injuries pile up and younger guys start to outpace and eventuallyreplace them. Isn't one of the Hawks main point of criticism over the last few years that they gave put lavish contracts after there first couple couple cups in order to reward the core players? Maybe this is part of the cost of those contracts?

TL;DR his ROI is dropping and his risk for incurring a cap penalty is rising with it. All in all that cap space could easily double production if Bowman could free it up. ",hockey

What do you say to Russian historian Boris Borisov, who studied census records and noticed that 7 million Americans mysteriously vanished during the famine of 1932-33 (larger even than the death toll experienced in the Ukraine at the same time period, which was imposed by Stalin).

See his article *The American Famine*.

* Footnote: This is no dig against you (because I didn't know about this tragedy either until recently). But I'm always blown away how American children are taught about the suffering of Jews in another continent and taken on field trips to the Holocaust Museum . . . but are utterly unaware of even larger death-tolls in their own country (suppressed by their own government). I can understand their ignorance that Mao and Stalin actually murdered far more people than Hitler (because those happened in distant lands, with no real lobby groups in America to popularize and humanize the victims). I can see how they have no idea about the Armenian genocide or what horrors in Cambodia. But to not know your *own* history? Simply staggering. It's like all those deaths had no value, no meaning. In school today, kids are taught about Anne Frank. But if someone even brought up the deaths of poor Oakies in the US at this time-period (dying in larger numbers), they'd be shouted down and told to ""Check their privilege. Oakies don't count as a victim-group. They're white. They don't matter"". There is no ""Diary of a Young Oakie Girl"" that kids are taught in schools. But plenty of globalist propaganda books to encourage kids to ignore their own history and identify, rather, with European Jews, Syrian refugee children, Hindu social justice activist teenagers like Malala, etc. See an example here: http://ew.com/books/2017/04/12/bana-alabed-memoir/ I leave you with a quote from Orwell: ""The most effective way to destroy a people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”",conspiracy

He was critical of the Brandon Weedon pick at the time, and called Josh Gordon a waste. Both ended up being true. He had a shitty first draft, but that's not unexpected when he was trying to overhaul the  entire scouting system (see BB's first draft, where we drafted a bunch of slugs ahead of Tom Brady). He got a 1st back for Trent Richardson, and got picks for 2014, but then got canned before using them.

This is why I *love* Blizzard's design focus so much more than Riot Games.  I played LoL since it came out, but I grew sick and tired of Riot games forcing meta shifts based on pick rates or win rates.  It's sickening.  They focus their game too much on competitive play and the majority of players are not in competitive.
Blizzard is doing the right thing.  The issue is that players are not used to having to work so hard to figure things out.  
&gt;I do not agree with the philosophy that we should just make balance changes solely to shift people off the meta


This, so much this.. Thank you Jeff.


&gt;Regarding the meta changing because players have innovated a new strategy – well – this is the best-case scenario. We’ve seen this happen time and time again. This usually happens in a pro tournament where a team pulls out a new strategy and performs well.

Warlords was probably the first expansion that I deemed my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, it had its high points. The quests, the zones, the story driven content (which argus is all about, so all aboard the hype train).

The raids were neat. But the content gaps was what killed a potentially decent expansion. People bring up that Mop had the same issue. And yes, it did. But only really at the end. 15 months of siege. 

What really put a damper on it for me, wasn't so much the content drought. It was how the story just died. Like they completely half assed it and stopped caring. Alternate timeline stories are usually cringy, but the idea of a different, uncorrupted clan of orc conquerors was pretty cool.

They handled it very poorly though. Kargath? Easiest boss in the first raid. Nerzhul? 5 man dungeon boss. Like really?

Let's not forget the ""Draenor is free!!"" Ending of WoD. That infuriated me. That entire expansion didn't even matter aside from alternate guldan kickstarting legion. Idk, just pisses me off that the expansion started off so strong, only to have their writers go on vacation letting the newly hired interns finish up.",wow

There was no assumption of your political side in my comment, seriously? Just a disappointment that you sounded okay with CNN's crucification, but not extending the same critique to others. 
The point I was hoping you would deduce was that if CNN is propaganda and it can be handled like this and Fox has been considered to be propaganda also, why not treat all main stream media outlets the same here for their obvious opinions and alternative info agenda.

So what? During those 2000 years, the Jews have prayed 3 times a day for the restoration of Jerusalem and an end to their exile (and they still do, bizarrely). They never forgot. It was every Jew's dream to live in the holy land. Some Jewish religious authorities, like Nahmanides for example, maintained that it was actually a *commandment* from God to live in the holy land. 

&gt; Since that time--for two thousand years--the Jews did not run the place. 
So what? You don't get to take stuff from people, who desperately want it back, and tell them that ""for 30 years ever since you got kicked out, you wanted your house back. Too long, it's mine now!""

&gt; The Jews were barely a blip in the history or Jerusalem.
Yeah, just 800 years or so. That's not so much! Barely a blip!

&gt; Third, Jerusalem is older than Judaism. So even if you believe the Jews ran the place 2,000 years ago for two seconds, the canaanites ruled the place before them.
I used this argument, and you discredited it. So why does this argument work for Canaanites but not for Jews? I don't want to make any bold accusations but it appears to me that the only explanation for this is a bias against Jews.",worldnews

&gt; Trzy Korony (meaning three crowns) was a short-lived Polish rock band formed by Krzysztof Klenczon in 1970 after his departure from the most legendary Polish 60s rock band Czerwone Gitary. The group released a couple of singles and one album Krzysztof Klenczon i Trzy Korony. The band disbanded shortly thereafter and Klenczon left Poland to live in Chicago, US.

&gt; The band's most famous song is 10 w skali Beauforta (10 Beaufort), originally rehearsed and recorded by Czerwone Gitary, but it is this band's version that is considered definite and is most well-known.

&gt; Julia Stone is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Newport, Australia. She's part of the siblings Angus &amp; Julia Stone.  Following four years of critically acclaimed collaboration with brother Angus, Julia Stone's The Memory Machine marks her first foray into solo musical terrain. With the global success of the duo’s first two albums and accompanying sell out tours, Julia’s debut solo album demonstrates a musical confidence and story-telling capacity that reflects her evolution as an artist.

&gt; On The Memory Machine Julia employs the talents of a range of musicians from her musical community and undertakes production duties alongside co-producers Keiran Kelly and Brad Albetta.

&gt; Subtle, minimal arrangements show the self-assuredness that Julia has brought to this timely project and though characteristically sweet and melodious, the subjects of her stories often run to the darker side, reflected in the artwork inspired by old horror flick posters. Written and recorded over five months in a variety of locations these songs comprise a journey of their own.

&gt; Her songs can comfortably inhabit the surreal, where love is an unreliable latchkey kid (‘Where Does the Love Go?’); an internal dying fire warms the hands of grasping sycophants (‘Lights Inside this Dream’); My Baby harks back to the sweet serenades of the fifties and ‘Catastrophe’ provides a delightful romp through the disasters of clumsy connections. The title track, ‘The Memory Machine’, is a paean to lost love from a simpler era with Julia’s hushed vocal veering into dreamy longing.

&gt; Julia Stone’s talents as a musician are evident, providing not only vocal and guitar, but also piano, bass, ukulele and percussion, though it is Julia’s characteristic and unique vocals that shine here. She works as an professional artist since 2006. 

&gt; The Memory Machine is an intriguing, disturbing, moving and ultimately enchanting solo debut from an accomplished and self-assured artist. Read more on Last.fm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_II#Jewish_and_Muslim_immigration

&gt;In July 1492, the new state of Spain expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations as part of the Spanish Inquisition. Bayezid II sent out the Ottoman Navy under the command of admiral Kemal Reis to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed.[6] He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. ""You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,"" he said to his courtiers, ""he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!""[7] Bayezid addressed a firman to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception.[7] **He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire.**

Turkey sheltered many more Jewish people during WW2, as well. Albania was the only European country to have more Jews after WW2 than before, and it's a Muslim country.

10458,"Good for you for joining a camp where you are pushing yourself. One of the best ways to improve in anything is to challenge your limits. At any moment in your life you should compare yourself against yourself first and foremost. So don't ask ""how can I not fuck up?"" And don't ask ""how can I be better than these Swedes?"" Ask- ""how can leave this camp a better player than when I came in?"" Learn from adversity but don't let it define your success or failure. 



Use the camp as a chance to see what you need to focus on, think about your mistakes and what you can do differently. Maybe ask the coaches what they see. Maybe ask some of the nicer players if they have any tips. 



For the scrimmage - accept that you will make mistakes and that some people might talk shit. But don't let that fact weigh you down, just focus on trying your hardest. Keep your game simple, concentrate on a few key aspects that you will try to execute to perfection (like making sure your skating is in good form even when you're tired, or tape to tape passes, or a quick release). 



Just remember that this camp is just one week in a much longer hockey journey that's going to continue for many, many years. And more importantly it's just one week in your life. You have an exciting road ahead where you'll continue to grow both as a hockey player and as a person. ",hockey

No, I am clearly not saying that. I am saying that Trump ran on an anti-globalisation platform without explaining his reasons, which means that his voters most likely misjudged his intentions, as they could not possibly understand the implications and Trump made no effort to explain them.

&gt; Without having negotiated them? How? ""I don't like it, I'm going to renegotiate or pull out"" is the most he could do before entering office.

That is ridiculous. If he doesn't like it, he should be able to name what it is he doesn't like and what he intends to change. If the ""I don't like it!"" is enough of a statement to be elected president in the US, that nation is indeed pretty fucked.

&gt; This does not fall under the jurisdiction of the President, this is in the domain of Congress. The President can veto or not. 

So why be so admant about something out of your control, with no plan and zero effort to mediate between opposing factions in congress? That is text book populism.

So now you'll see all these people saying ""selling wolf tickets"", or ""wolf tickets"", or apparently now just shortened to ""selling tickets"" - none of whom knew this term or used it just a year ago. 

You'll know because no one who uses it can explain the 'wolf' part, because it was already an obscure reference in the little-known song.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b09fcef17a7f41f8a8c08d8b834a3d93.png)  

&gt; Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band are generally regarded as one of the best live bands ever. Famous for their extremely long concerts, the band is well-respected throughout rock. Note that only live recordings can be credited to Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band. The official artist credit for all of Bruce Springsteen's studio recordings (even for those recorded with the E Street Band as his studio band) is Bruce Springsteen.

&gt; Since forming in 1972, the band's members have changed; however, core members include saxophonist Clarence Clemons, organist Danny Federici, bassist Garry Tallent, drummer Max Weinberg, pianist Roy Bittan and, of course, guitarist/singer/songwriter Bruce Springsteen. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt joined the band while recording Born to Run and made this record at least possible. He became one of the most honored and most influential members.

&gt; Other musicians important to the band include guitarist Nils Lofgren (who stepped in after Van Zandt quit); guitarist/singer Patti Scialfa (who is also Springsten's wife); and pianist David Sancious and drummers ""Mad Dog"" Vini Lopez and Ernest ""Boom"" Carter, who all had left the band prior to Born to Run. Also, The Rising tour saw the official addition of violinist Soozie Tyrell. 

&gt; In 1989 the band split up, after the massive success of the Born in the USA tour and the quieter Tunnel of Love tour. However, in 1999, the band reunited and embarked on a rather successful 18-month reunion tour - the ""E-United Tour"" - and now were powered by three guitars (Springsteen, Van Zandt and Lofgren, with Scialfa usually playing a fourth, acoustic guitar). 

&gt; Following the events of September 11, 2001, Springsteen and the Band embarked on their first studio recordings (excepting a short recording session for Springsteen's 1995 Greatest Hits album) since 1984's Born in the U.S.A. The band recorded The Rising in 2002, and then hit the road for another marathon, two-year tour. 

&gt; After The Rising, Springsteen recorded two more albums without the E Streeters followed by ""Magic"", released in October 2007 and featuring the hit single ""Radio Nowhere"". Magic was followed up by a traditionally strong tour throughout 2008, during which original band-member and friend Danny Federici passed away. Federici had already been temporarily replaced by Charlie Giordano, with whom Springsteen played the year before during the Seeger Sessions. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rounded the 100-show tour at Harley-Davidson's 105th anniversary celebration.

&gt; On January 27, 2009 Springsteen's twenty-fourth album ""Working on a Dream"" will be released. According to the official press release, Working on a Dream was recorded with the E Street Band and features twelve new Springsteen compositions plus two bonus tracks. It is the fourth collaboration between Springsteen and Brendan O'Brien, who produced and mixed the album. A new tour for 2009 is expected to be announced soon. Springsteen and the E Street Band will play The Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009.

&gt; Saturday 27th July 2009 saw Bruce and the E-Streeters played The Glastonbury Festival, England. This was the band's first-ever UK festival performance, a total of 135,000 people watched an epic, two-and-a-half hour headlining set.

10568,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

2 - Don't mention anything incriminating during your Reddit correspondence. This is good = ""Wanna grab a beer?"" This is not good = ""Wanna meet and smoke some marijuana?""

3 - When you meet in real life, talk casually first and when you feel it's safe to proceed, ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" or a variant of that. This is important because a law officer must tell you the truth, even if it's a drug arrest sting. Otherwise, it will be very easy for your lawyer to have your case thrown out.

&gt; Dan Croll (born Daniel Francis Croll, 18 July 1990) is a British singer-songwriter born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England. He moved to Liverpool when he was 18 to attend the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). While at LIPA, he won the national Songwriter of the Year award from the Musicians Benevolent Fund and was one of eight students picked to have a one-to-one with LIPA founder Sir Paul McCartney. He is currently signed to Turn First Records.

&gt; Croll’s first release was as part of the Communion Records' compilation 'New Faces', released on April 23, 2012. Communion have supported Croll both with this release and promoting many of his early live shows.

&gt; Croll signed to Turn First Records at the start of 2012. His debut single, ""From Nowhere"", was released worldwide on September 24, 2012 via Turn First / Racquet Records (Croll’s own imprint) as a digital download and limited 7”. ""From Nowhere"" spent 3 days at the top of the Hype Machine popular charts, was playlisted in the UK on BBC 6 Music, XFM and Amazing Radio, and received spot plays on BBC Radio 1. Croll was named a Guardian New Band of the Day in November 2012 and described as “Paul Simon jamming with Prince. Very nice”.

&gt; Croll released his second single ""Compliment Your Soul"" in March 2013. This was followed up by the release of ""In/Out"" in July 2013.

&gt; On October 13, 2013, Croll released the song ""Home"" on his own VEVO channel on YouTube.

&gt; On October 29, 2013, during an on-air Virgin Radio interview, Croll confirmed he has finished recording his full length debut album. The LP is expected to be released early next year. Croll told Variance Magazine in October that he is aiming for a ""mid-February"" release in 2014.

&gt; His song ""Compliment Your Soul"" has also recently made it onto the soundtrack for FIFA 14. As well as FIFA, a remix of From Nowhere, titled From Nowhere (Baardsen Remix), was featured on the soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto V. The song was featured on one of the game's radio stations, Radio Mirror Park.

&gt; In November 2013, he announced during a Concert in Camden Town London, that his first album Sweet Disarray, would be released on March 10, 2014. Read more on Last.fm.

10859,"While its true that he was misused with us, people just seem to ignore that all his physical abilities fell of a fucking cliff. His speed was the most notable, but he couldn't change direction or react to cuts and got pushed around by basically every receiver he faced. In the end with us, he was basically so slow that he couldn't cover anything more than 5-15 yards down the field. Like at all, he'd be beat by several yards 15 yards down the field even with a cushion. 

Furthermore, all of the sudden he couldn't play. Most notably the physical side of football. Dude wouldn't tackle, like at all. Him and DRC would literally let people run right past them without giving a flying fuck. But it wasn't just that, he couldn't cover anymore, even if he had managed to stick to the WR, he wouldn't turn around to look for the ball, he wouldn't use his arms/hands to deflect the pass and he made wrong reads all the time. 

Misused, yeah, but people seem to have this thing about him only playing man. We literally played him both man and zone, press and off, used short and used deep. We did everything. While it didn't help that he was asked to do a different thin like every other month because of shitty scheme/staff, people ignore that he was equally bad at everything we asked him to do. It wasn't just scheme, he was done. 

He was also kinda not there mentally, which is super weird because when you listen to him talk you could obviously hear that he was a really good dude and super smart. He really was a guy you could root for, but at the same time there was these kind of weird moments, the most notably that he didn't eat with his teammates, but would go out to his car and eat alone, yet a lot of players spoke of him as a leader and a mentor. 

I hope he is doing good because I have nothing against him, but he fell of a cliff BIGTIME and while we most certainly wasn't using him the right way, theres no right way to use a skillset if the skillset sucks, and Nnamdi wasn't the same guy anymore. ",nfl

10861,"&gt;We'll get ICC because it is the best all around raid in Wrath.

I simply can't agree with that. There's only five fights in the instance that weren't absolute push overs: Deathwhisper, Deathbringer, Putricide, Sindragosa, and the Lich King.

(You could make an argument for dreamwalker based on it having interesting mechanics but it was a total snooze fest in practice because it was tuned too easy)

Deathwhsiper was your typical add fight, Saurfang had a couple of really neat mechanics but is pretty straight forward, and Sindragosa might have been the worst designed fight of the expansion.

So that leaves Putricide and LK as fights that were difficult, interesting, and fun, with heroic Lich King being possibly the best fight ever made in an MMO.

Meanwhile in Ulduar had Flame Levi, the four Keepers, Yogg, and Algalon.

Flame Leviathan is probably too controversial to argue as an interesting fight so I'll concede that one off the bat, Hodir is just a don't stand in stuff and do insane DPS, so that's pretty meh too. Thorim and Freya were both decently interesting fights in their own respect, about as interesting as Deathwhisper and Deathbringer.

So, in you have Yogg/Algalon/Firefighter as the best fights in Ulduar vs Putricide and LK, and while LK himself is one of the best fights ever made, I just don't think he's enough to bring his entire instance above Ulduar.

**But** I still think we'll get ICC for Timewalking for a few reasons:
The Lich King story is relevant again in the same way BT is right now.
Ulduar has a lot of complex mechanics (in particular it's hard mode activators) that really don't lend themselves well to a timewalking raid.

&gt; Stone Sour is a three time Grammy Award-nominated American alternative metal/hard rock band from Des Moines, Iowa, USA. The band was founded by Corey Taylor, also the vocalist from Slipknot, and former drummer Joel Ekman.

&gt; Early days
Taylor's long time friend, Shawn Economaki, joined shortly after, and filled in as the bass player. The band had played clubs and bars with different guitarists - often filling the position for just one show. This time, Stone Sour recorded 2 demo tapes, in 1992 and 1994. Shortly after, in 1995, James (Jim) Root - who is now also part of Slipknot with Corey Taylor - joined the band. The group was complete, and in 1996 recorded another demo tape, and songs from which would later be used in 2002 on their self titled debut album, Stone Sour. The band was named after an alcoholic drink that consists of one part whiskey, one part orange juice, with a splash of sour mix.

&gt; In 1997 the band went on hiatus when Taylor and Root spent most of their time with Slipknot, who were another up-and-coming act in Des Moines at the time who were to soon earn a record deal. Jim Root also joined the band a year later, and Economaki went on to become their stage manager. Ekman stayed in Des Moines, and formed a family.

&gt; Debut album (""Stone Sour"")
The band recorded their debut self-titled album in Cedar Falls, Iowa, which was released on 31 July 2002 in the UK, and on 1 August in the US. Aided by the song ""Bother"" which was featured on the Spider-Man soundtrack (credited only to Taylor), the album went on to become Gold. The band toured for six months with label mates Sinch and Chevelle before going on a temporary hiatus as Taylor and Root went back to join Slipknot for another album and tour.

&gt; Come What(ever) May, live album, and another hiatus
The band came back in 2006 to release their second studio album, Come What(ever) May. They parted ways with drummer Joel Ekman to be with his nine year old son Issac Ekman who was diagnosed and died from brain cancer and later recruited current drummer, Roy Mayorga of Soulfly. The album was released on August 1, 2006. It was met with mediocre reviews from critics, and sold 8 million copies in the first week, allowing it to debut at number four on the Billboard 2000. The band toured for the next year and a half, releasing the Live in Moscow album exclusively to iTunes on August 14, 2007. Corey Taylor and James Root returned to Slipknot to record their fourth full length studio album, All Hope Is Gone. Mayorga is now performing with the band Black President. While on the road with Slipknot, Taylor and Root are said to be writing along with Roy writing while doing the Black Presidents gig for the next Stone Sour album.

&gt; Audio Secrecy
As of 12th January 2010, Stone Sour had re-entered the recording studio to record their 3rd album, the first in four years. It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz (a Grammy Award winning producer: Foo Fighters, Velvet Revolver, Rush, Alice In Chains; also produced their 2006's gold certified Come What(ever) May) at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. On June 10, the band released a free download of ""Mission Statement"", which was later released as a single on iTunes. The first official single, ""Say You'll Haunt Me"", however, was released on July 6, 2010. The album was released on September 7, 2010 on Roadrunner Records. Audio Secrecy is also the first studio album by Stone Sour that does not feature a spoken word track, with ""Omega"" and ""The Frozen"" on Stone Sour and Come What(ever) May, respectively (however, ""The Frozen"" was a bonus track).

&gt; House of Gold &amp; Bones
The Absolute Zero Songfacts reports that Stone Sour's fourth long-player, House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 1, is the first part of a double concept album (the 2nd part is obviously titled ""House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 2""). The two records are about a young man struggling with growing up. Read more on Last.fm.

11043,"As should be clear by now (and as I'm sure you yourself know), under the Canadian points system you would not qualify, and unless that system changes (which is not likely), you will never qualify. So, if you really are serious about immigrating, you need to do something to increase your score. As has been mentioned here already, Quebec runs its own system and gives priority to french-speaking applicants (i.e. given two applicants who differ only in that one speaks french and the other does not, the french-speaking applicant will score higher.) They give this priority on the basis of proven language skills, not country of origin (though it's easier to show fluency if you've been educated in a former french colony, such as Senegal, for instance,) and I personally know of applicants from non-french-speaking countries who were successful because, among other things, they took language courses prior to applying. I know enough Italian to know that, as a native speaker, you should be able to meet this qualification by taking some courses and then passing the relevant french exam. That's a start. Second, if you could get a degree (doesn't matter so much what the field is, what matters is that it is a university degree, not a diploma or certificate program,) then you could apply to a post-secondary program in Canada. Most graduate programs provide funding and tuition grants; it's not a lot, but it is enough to live on (barely), and as graduate student, you would be able to work while you were enrolled. Further, recent changes to immigration policy means that you would have a much easier time getting permanent residency after you graduated.

So then you get the shift from questions in the ERRE online consultation asking people to rate the following statements from 1-5:

* Independent candidates should be able to be elected to Parliament
* The current electoral system adequately reflects voters' intentions
* Seats should be allocated in proportion to the percentage of votes received by each political party
* Voters should elect local candidates to represent them in Parliament
* The current electoral system should be changed

to questions from mydemocracy.ca like agree/disagree with:

* There should be parties in Parliament that represent the views of all Canadians, even if some are radical or extreme.
*  Governments should have to negotiate their policy decisions with other parties in Parliament, even if it is less clear who is accountable for the resulting policy.
*  It is better for several parties to have to govern together than for one party to make all the decisions in government, even if it takes longer for government to get things done.

Political office falls somewhere in the middle. They choose to be representatives, but they are representatives, and they can only be in the offices they have been elected to. There should also be very few/small limitations on who can be a representative, because the people should have all the power to choose their representatives.

Compared to gerrymandering, FPTP, and campaign financing, this is a very minor issue. But that aside, I think dress codes should only be concerned with what's the bare minimum of necessary restrictions, given the nature of the work. And I don't care what a politician looks like.

in my view, what rules the world isn't men, it is indeed a hierarchical system of dominance -- but I believe it has little to do with the male/female dynamic.

in fact, I bet if YOU were on the top, it would be drugs and bisexual orgies for you lol. I feel like the power elite have more In common with transsexuals than anything else.

the internal power hierarchy has different rules than society does at the bottom. its inconceivable for us to know what its like to have the power to have whatever we want in an instant.

it inherently changes people.

I DO believe every social issue and critique mentioned by feminists is a real, Marxist/anarchist problem.

however I feel that the movement has been totally co-opted for extremely sinister purposes.

a true Marxist does not support Nazi or stalin-esque control of media and knowledge, and centralized control of 'the party'

what many of these radical feminists do is directly opposed to communist OR anarchist ideals.

instead of removing the hierarchy and power structure, they become bent on 'fixing' it like so many other good capitalists, but also bent on emotional and personal desires.

even just changing social relations to only be in the interest of one gender because it 'feels' better.|

how about we end all hierarchy and enter a brave new world that was no different than if we had been reborn one day on an alien planet where none of this had ever happened in the first place.

There had also been practices such as requiring statements of faith to hold public office. Granted, there are people even today who refuse to vote for someone unless they believe in a religion--but in those days you couldn't even run for office without it.

Fast forward to the twenty-first century and a few well-funded individuals from particular sects have started trying to construe ""religious freedom"" as a pretext to get exemptions from laws that everyone ha to follow.

As a lifelong Unitarian Universalist I take a dim view of that new trend: the church I was raised in has been performing same sex weddings for more than forty years, but it's only within the last couple of years that the Federal government recognized some of the weddings we blessed between two consenting adults.

It's probably unlikely that they'd purchase Dutch Genetics (eg. Sensi Seeds, or Dutch Passion, etc.) and then take a strain from there and re-name it.  If they grew out seeds of say, ...Great White Shark, or Dutch Treat it's unlikely that they'd just re-name it to something ""proprietary"".  Instead they'd likely take the seeds, grow them out en masse, and select the choicest plants with the characteristics they really wanted, and cross them with another strain to create a whole new cross and then either simply grow it out continuously from cuttings/clones; or attempt to continue to work with the cross and create a stable hybrid line of their own.

So starting with Dutch Genetics (second to none in terms of stability and quality); creating their own crosses/hybrid strains, naming them ""Telus Timewarp"" or some other idiotic name.  Then selling those lines to consumers.

That'd be my guess.

I'd assume the LPs have their shit together enough NOT to do what so much of the black and grey markets do, which is taking a decent landrace strain, cross, or hybrid and naming it something 'catchy' or appealing and selling it off.

To come so close to something your franchise has never tasted and then to have it all turn to ash is brutal. The Patriots (and Boston) had already had incredible recent success and multiple championships. 

Sure, a perfect season would have been a nice crown jewel, but really that's like complaining that your cheeseburger doesn't have bacon on it while there's a man starving on the street corner who's hoping for any bite of food. 

The Patriots are champions. Tom Brady and the Pats, every fan in Boston, they've all experienced multiple championships.

&gt;I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he’s still half asleep, bleary eyed… basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-a** circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He’s squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It’s painful to watch.

&gt;But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I’m-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ‘heeeey. It’s OPS. Could you… shift our barpat… yeah, one six five. Thanks.’ And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.

&gt;And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie’s face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I’ve just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship’s back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he’s changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He’s literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.

&gt;He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I’m terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he’s not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",AskReddit

ACCA: I dropped after 1 episode. It just wasn't for me.

Boku no Hero: I have on hold after seeing the first episode. I hope to revisit it some day but I'm not really a fan of super heroes.

Chuunibyou: I love this show more than most. I don't know what to say.

Durarara: On hold after 1 episode. It was okay.

Hyouka: Dropped after 9 episodes. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't get invested. I'm not really a fan of mysteries so I was bored for the most part.

Kiznaiver: I thought it was fun and an interesting concept even if the ending was weird.

Mirai Nikki: One of the first anime I'd seen and probably the show that made me an anime fan. I probably wouldn't like it as much on a second viewing but it holds a special place in my heart.

Shinsekai Yori: Dropped after 5 or 6 episodes. I just found it really boring  and stupid. It doesn't do a good enough job of explaining the world so its hard to really get attached to the characters. I actually like the art style though it was fairly inconsistent.

Rakugo Shinju: Dropped after 1 episode. It's just not for me.

Steins;Gate: On hold after 1 episode. It was okay and I fully expect it to get better but I'm setting it aside for now.

SAO: There's not a single redeeming quality about it if you ask me. I didn't expect to hate it as much as I did. I gave up after the first arc because the next one was supposed to be even worse.

Tanaka-kun: Dropped after one episode. I just found it too slow. I get that that's the point but by the end of the first episode I felt like I'd already experienced the whole show.

Youjo Senki: Dropped after 1 episode. It was really ugly. I don't really care about war settings either.

Gakkougurashi: Yea I fucking love this show. It was tailor-made for me.

Yu-Gi-Oh: Big part of my childhood. I still enjoy it because of nostalgia.

Rewrite: This is the worst show I have ever seen. I usually tend to have a problem with adaptations of VN's. I just feel like they don't adapt well to animation but this was just so lifeless and nonsensical.

It was going to be awesome, overnight, in cabins, by a lake, with boys. I had the permission slip turned in, a sleeping bag bought, and I was more than ready to go. 1 week before the trip I was on the playground bouncing a basketball, and some little jerk took it away from me. I went and told my teacher to tell him to give it back because he stole it from me, and he wouldn't, he said, you can get it back yourself. At the time he was my favorite teacher, but this infuriated me, I got so mad that I called him a butt hole for not getting the ball for me. He kinda laughed and I said, no I'm serious. That jerk wrote me up and I wasn't allowed to go on the camping trip! It was so ridiculous, especially since I had never been written up before and was a straight A student.

It's not like the game needed another melee spec to begin with or more than a handful of people would actually roll hunter to play as melee. Nope, they even delete a (universally liked) ranged spec for it and fail to preserve the playstyle in the MM talent tree. 

So bad start aside, survival isn't even in a remotely good spot designwise. They have to manage a complete clusterfuck of absolutely uninteractive abilities, have to target traps in combat (or use macros), are punished heavily by switching targets, movement or doing mechanics, have probably the most underwhelming artifact ability (even worse than affliction locks in my opinion and those had a last minute 180° before going live and then got a maintenance buff) and the spec has no distinct feel whatsoever. Why do I throw grenades on a target that has my birdos swirling around it. Also why do I summon a snake as DPS cooldown? Aren't those BM things? What's the fuzz with all the ""fire and steel"" theme that kind of doesn't fit to rexxar or the spearfighter thing we got going..

What are we supposed to be? Blessed spearfighters that summon beasts? Hardened survivalists that lay traps, poison their weapons and ambush people? Maniacs that use explosives while being in melee range? Guess all of it. A bit. Problem is nothing of this works in combination. Multiple poorly thought out ideas frankensteined together and there we are. 

I tried playing survival on and off mostly for nighthold because I wanted a more demanding spec and thought that fighting with a spear is kind of badass but asides some very few occasions in which you could hit really hard with butchery it felt underwhelming even when you don't fuck up anything.. Also blizzard doesn't even try to improve them. I don't remember even one blue post/ dev talk/ anything that even acknowledged that something somewhere probably went wrong and what they have planned for the spec. 

Probably nothing because the mix of a very small target audience and that the spec also turned out pretty bad didn't leave over that many people to justify the rework the spec would need to be attractive.

So yeah, I get a strong ""failed experiment""-vibe while playing the spec atm...

They have to have to have a higher wage bill then the majority of the EPL combined. 

Also with the inflation of wage bills (as I digress), it's become the fashionable thing to buy teams. We have clubs like City and Chelsea who have the money and the desire to compete, so they can drop 50 mil on Torres, or whothefuckknows on David Silva and such. It's become almost impossible to stay on top without spending huge to bring in players.

11594,"I'll admit, I do tend to look at 4bar opponents and think 'tasty food' due to the ease of bursting their entire healthbar (making any regen useless).

I think I failed to mention in this post, but on AD champs I run hp/level yellows due to lack of better options (dodge is random and a lot weaker with the quickness mastery from defense, mana regen is generally unneeded (and can be obtained from blues if you want) and flat armour is relatively bad for a carry that should be positioned/protected to avoid focussed damage).

These not only provide a bit of a late game buffer against incidental aoe but also mean you have 5 bars at level 1, allowing you to use your quints for movespeed or armour pen (I go armour pen myself, quints+reds+masteries gives 31 total which is good all game and, as you quite rightly mention, is huge early game. Plus since I generally get phantom dancer (with zeal around the start of mid game with early farm) the movement speed is less essential).

With AP champs this isn't really an option since you need the blues for flat CDR and get your mana regen from your yellows, so the only option left for early hp is the quints.

So yeh, I don't run with 4bars at level 1 on any champ (except support, I've recently started trying gold/10 quints on those, but I don't suggest rushing to get those unless you also have far, far too many runes and champs to need your IP for anything more important ;), it's just that AD allows you other ways to get that early health that AP can't afford to use...",leagueoflegends

11712,"Well, perhaps car was a bad example.  Perhaps I should have used oil changes?  That is a really good analogy, because someone not getting oil changes could have a very detrimental effect on society if their car breaks down in the middle of the freeway - causing an accident.

Should the government take money from you to fund oil changes so that everyone can get them, and perhaps regular car maintenance and checkups, to help keep cleaner safer cars on the road?  Is that where we want this to go?  Note that, for the most part, people are pretty good at getting oil changes for themselves and don't really need any help.  The same with dental work.

My position would be much more succinctly put with just ""If the government isn't doing it now, and it is not a major health/safety/environment issue, then there is no reason for them to start doing it"".

Favre had a rocket arm. He had flashes of brilliance. He was resilient. But no way is he a top 20 guy. He's basically Eli Manning with a stronger arm. I could run 20 QBs off the top of my head, past and present, that I would rather have. He's not even the 2nd best Packers QB of all time, IMO.

&gt; Incubus is a five-man alternative rock band formed in 1991, based in Calabasas, California. Members include Brandon Boyd (vocals and percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Ben Kenney (bass), Jose Pasillas II (drums) and DJ Chris Kilmore (turntables). Former members of the band include Gavin Koppel (a.k.a. DJ Lyfe) (turntables) and Alex Katunich (a.k.a. Dirk Lance) (bass). The band's name may seem a peculiar choice to fans, as an incubus is a type of demon that, in mythological lore, comes in the night and has sex with women while they are sleeping; it seduces them in their dreams The story behind the name is that the band needed to think of a name hours before their first show and, after a few failed choices, Mike looked in a dictionary and chose ""Incubus"" almost at random. Mike says that the name was chosen because it sounded silly; Brandon holds that it was chosen because they were teenagers and the definition had the word ""sex"" in it. ""We really didn't want to rape women in their sleep. But, we were fifteen and it seemed harmless to us then, and we never changed it,"" says the band.

&gt; Incubus has received both critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several successful singles. The band earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album Make Yourself. In 2001, Incubus became even more successful with the single ""Drive"" and their follow-up album Morning View. Their sixth studio album, Light Grenades, debuted at No. 1 in 2006 and has received Gold certification in the U.S. Incubus released their first greatest hits album Monuments and Melodies in June 2009, accompanied by a tour of the United States, Japan and Canada. The band's most recent album, If Not Now, When?, was released on July 12, 2011.

This leaves us with about $25 million for Tavares' contract and Nylander's extension, which sounds like a lot until you realize that the following season we have Marner, Matthews, and Kapanen coming off their ELCs, Gardiner is a UFA and there is still another year on Marleau and Martin's contracts.

Its definitely a possibility. If management is confident in their pipeline they can go for it in 2018 Chicago style. Then in off season they dump Marleau to a cap floor team, let Gardiner walk, trade Kapanen's rights, then dump all of the remaining money into Matthews and Marner while filling the remaining roster spots with callups from the Marlies and cheap UFAs.",hockey

La beauté de cela, c’est que les évènements par et pour les jeunes comme les Jeux donnent le contexte parfait pour que les participants s’encouragent entre eux et se sentent à l’aise à s’exprimer sans craindre reproche après reproche de leurs parents ou leurs enseignants.

Do positive accounts of these schools not exist? Were the students commiting some of these crimes themselves? x children died of tb there but didn't many others outside of these schools?

There will always be people who love school (like myself) and go into higher education. But there will always be people who hate school and go into lower earning jobs. That's certainly something that is changing in schools, how to teach students differently, so everyone learns better. But currently for some people, school just isn't for them. And if they can get a job out of school, what's wrong with that?

Obviously people telling kids to drop out is a terrible influence on kids but that really isn't a majority of those that hate school. We need to get rid of that stigma about dropping our and promote options for those that struggle to do well in school.

11847,"Not everyone can agree that KyoAni tells the best stories.  But I think we can all agree they have the best movement and detail in TV animation.  

Movement is an often overlooked aspect of visual story-telling.  As is the ability to express something without dumping it into dialogue.  But it can easily be abused.  Some animated stuff (especially Disney movies or heavy CGI movies like Transformers) try to have characters moving every single frame.  And it is not only taxing to watch, but it breaks the suspension of disbelief.  Even in a live action movie, there will be times when a person stands still.  And so when animators have a character always expressing themselves with hand gestures or shifting their body weight in every single scene, it throws your mind off.  It looks ""unrealistic"", despite actually having more detail and emotion put into it.  This is also why you can watch a movie like Star Wars and the CGI just doesn't look right.  Because the human will be moving relatively little but the CGI alien interacting with him looks like its moving at 120 fps and never sits still.  Always some kind of mouth movement or a little twitch in the eye or the hairs on its head keep blowing in a non existent breeze...it's a mess.

KyoAni on the other hand has found a happy medium.  Despite a much bigger budget than most animation, the majority of their work still has characters who are relatively still for most scenes.  Long patches of Hyouka or Maid Dragon will have continuous frames where characters don't move beyond eye blinks or turning their head.  And that's perfectly fine.  They save the emphasis on movement for the scenes where it is needed.  When a character is reacting to something or when a character is nervous or when a character starts talking, then you will see some movement.  And I very much appreciate it.  Same as when Ghibli and Production IG do it.

It is especially noticeable with Kanna in Maid Dragon.  Her lack of movement and subtle reactions to things are a running gag on the show.  How she moves helps develop her character even more than what she says in dialogue.  And it just wouldn't work if she was always bobbing around like your average anime child.",anime

http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2013/311/580/2013-311580204-0b0083da-9.pdf

OP is a bit misleading though, for instance he calculates salaries from eployees and salaries from programs together. 73% of salaries in 2013 went to people outside the foundation. The foundation employees would average around(give or take some cause it's a year prior and I can't find 2014 info) about 27% of what OP listed.

Likewise, in 2013 travel expenses 77% of the cost was for program trave23% for its employees.

This brings up another point, the $5 billion to grants is exactly that, only to grants. The Clinton Foundation is an operating foundation, which means it spends money on implementing programs. Grants are given to other initiatives for implementing programs and the grant giving types are called non-operating.

It's tough to nail how much is spent on charity, but the OP does no one a service by misrepresenting numbers. A case about effectivity needs analyze it's various programs. The Clinton Foundation isn't really for making money, it's for the connections as programs are implemented internationally, along with prestige and leverage. Think of it as a bargaining chip, they will invest programs in a group for non tangible reciprocation.

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

&gt; Now that 7.2.5 has released, we can say with reasonable confidence and assuming no major changes, that Marksmanship will be the optimal raiding spec going into Tomb of Sargeras, mostly due to the potency of its new set bonuses. Its strengths remain the same as in the past, with a variety of different talents allowing for different playstyles, making it the most powerful spec for both single-target and multi-target in terms of raw damage. Its disadvantage on target switching has been significantly reduced, since Vulnerable no longer gives as much of a damage bonus to Aimed Shot that you cannot live without it. The spec is still much more limited by movement than Beast Mastery, and in hectic raiding situations this is its only potential downfall.

&gt; Beast Mastery remains a solid choice, though rather than being very competitive and sometimes even better at single-target than Marksmanship in ideal situations, it is now fair to say that its potential output is less than Marksmanship in nearly all situations. The same goes for Survival. Both these specs have fairly mediocre new Legendaries, and they do not benefit nearly as much from their set bonuses as Marksmanship does. Beast Mastery's ease of play and movement remains its biggest strength.",wow

You're welcome to your opinion about the movie, but I do have to disagree with you about the suit message.

Tony has proven he's still [something without the suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtntTvuv8Aw)

[And the entire message of the third movie was to be more than just his suit](https://youtu.be/5XqiCb6iW74?t=1m25s)

Additionally, Japanese people are generally a lot busier, and often don't have a lot of time and/or means to simply watch or rewatch potentially a 50+ episode series in order to see a new movie. Watching a few recap movies, however, is probably the easiest way to introduce new people to a series, as well as to refresh the minds of existing viewers before something like Madoka Rebellion or a new season of Lelouch.

Lastly, like other people have said, recap movies are a relatively cheap and easy way for companies to generate revenue for an existing IP, while also helping to boost sales and ratings for any future releases.

Hopefully this all makes sense. While it largely boils down to financial gain, there are reasons for people to watch them, it just might not widely apparent to people who have easy access to all these shows.",anime

Perspective in anime is a funny thing: objects look further away than they really would be; streets, halls, sidewalks are all wider than the actually would be; business are *much* larger than they actually are; etc, etc. It's the biggest reason no one in Japan has sex, and the concept of Love Hotels even exists in the first place: people can literally hear *everything* around them above a whisper.

All that to say that Tendou *absolutely* could hear Amano ranting at Tasuku from her vantage point. Not to mention that while what she's doing is *definitely* stalking, it was never stalking on a level of affection but rather stalking like you see constantly in anime of a club recruiter, which is actually fairly normal to happen if not still very weird.

So Tendou's heel-face *dere* turn isn't out of left-field, or *just happens*. There's clear build up, and they've basically been blaring it in your face since the opening sequence of the first episode with the giant yellow letters denoting her fall from grace being Amano's fault.

12427,"Best to ask that in /Christians.  They probably have some stuff already written up.

You have to go through the reasons of what God was doing with His original people and why there was The Law that no one could follow.  The old testament is foreshadowing of Jesus (Isaiah 53 prophesy).  Jesus came to fulfil the law and we are now in a period of grace and the gentiles (everyone who is not jewish) have been brought into the fold as the Jews turned against Jesus.  The Jews will be brought back into the fold though near the end.

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  All deserve eternal torment from a young age or birth.   We all go to court when we die and everyone is guilty unless Jesus died for you and His perfect sinless record plus the sacrifice transfers to our account, and we are adopted by God.  I have a house in Heaven right now.

Romans explains it all. Ecclesiastes (nothing new under the sun) is one of the best philosophical books in history (people just won't read the Bible because the World laughs at the concept).  Proverbs is great.  Romans really shows you this is real though, it hits you like a pile of bricks.  

God loved us SO MUCH to send His son to die for us when we were still His enemies.  This is God's ""Grand Demonstration"" of his glory in His grace that He did that...killing His son to save his enemies, and then loving us like children for all eternity.

Idk, it's frustrating talking about it and people just make jokes.  It's my entire life and always will be even after I die.

I didn't come from a Christian home at all.  God came to me, I didn't want to read a stupid Bible...  Then He showed up and made it clear what was going on.  

I'm not trying to convert anyone, I've never converted anyone.  I just see people walking off a cliff and people say just let them go and don't be rude pushing ""religion"" on them.  So I watch people die and I hate myself for just watching that without at least trying.

Read the Bible, you most likely will become a Christian.  Knock and He answers.  A person could try this for a few weeks then decide it's not real.  I just think it deserves some study since it's clearly the only Belief system with a book that speaks to you.  I wish I could explain that but Jesus speaks to me now.

12428,"&gt;Cmon you know that's not entirely true. This whole thing has turned into a lebron vs kyrie thing. Once kyrie told dan Gilbert he didn't want to play with Lebron it was bound to get ugly. 

You do know that was the leak right? 

Kyrie didn't have any intention of leaking, because it wouldn't benefit him. His trade value would be higher if teams didn't know Kyrie want to play elsewhere. So that probably meant Cavs didn't initiate that leak either. 

Also? Kyrie probably wouldn't want to leak he didn't want to play with Lebron, considering his image is in an utter despair. 




&gt;It's a war between both camps and kyries camp saying Lebron's camp leaked the story makes him look bad. Like they're both fighting the public perception battle against each other and people are choosing sides. 

I think you are going too deep, it seems obvious Lebron wants to make sure he seems blind sided by Kyrie's actions. 

There was no benefited party of this leak except Lebron. Atleast Lebron could act like he was victimized, Kyrie  is continuously getting attacked because of that.

His work at Sputnik, he claimed, was his own, rather than dictated by a foreign source.

**Team has to be in win-now mode**. This one is the easiest - you're not trading for Ovi to rebuild.

*Eliminated:* Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Carolina, and Arizona (NOTE: I think Carolina and Philadelphia are going to be competitive this year, but their window is still opening as opposed to closing).

*Remaining:* Toronto, Chicago, Dallas, Anaheim, LA, St. Louis, Rangers, Montreal, Tampa, Islanders, San Jose, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Boston, Minnesota, Edmonton, Carolina, Nashville.

**Must be looking for offense.** Ovechkin is likely an improvement over the vast majority of top 6 wingers, but given the assets that you'd give up to get him, you need big improvements (e.g. - while Ovi would step in and be the best winger on the Penguins without question, the Pens aren't hurting for offense to the point where adding him becomes a true need.

*Eliminated*: Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Arizona, *Toronto, Chicago, Dallas (given offseason moves), Tampa, Islanders (although he could be a huge help on the PP), Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Minnesota, and Edmonton.*

*Remaining:* Anaheim, LA, St. Louis, Rangers, Montreal, San Jose, Calgary, Ottawa, Boston, Carolina, and Nashville.

**Must have the cap space to eat this contract in the near term.** Cap space is key because Washington isn't going to take on dead money/retain at ton given their own concerns. I specify near term because these teams that are in win-now mode are going to be willing to deal with the term and a potential albatross later.

*Eliminated:* Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Arizona, Toronto, Chicago, Dallas (given offseason moves), Tampa, Islanders (although he could be a huge help on the PP), Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Minnesota, *Edmonton, Anaheim, LA, Rangers, Montreal (looking toward that Carey Price contract kicking in next year), San Jose, Calgary, Nashville (tons of space now, but looking at Arvidsson and Ryjo RFA), and Boston (Pasta RFA contract coming).*

*Remaining:* Ottawa.

So I'm left with one team - Ottawa. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume that Eugene has given the okay to foot the bill for the deal. I'm going to assume that Washington would be looking for help on the back-end, a roster forward, and picks. I think Thomas Chabot would be the center-piece that Washington would want, and then I would add 2018 1st, and Ryan Dzingel.

Not really. First of all, a war between Russia and Nato wouldnt be a world war. But there wouldnt be such war. Russia is scared of such scenario much much more than the West, because she wouldnt definitely lose it. The only reason why Russia acts so boldly is that she is certain the West isnt gonna punish her.

If you actually look at what happened in 2014, the referendum in Crimea was initially about giving Crimea more autonomy. Only after Russia saw the reaction from the West, it actually went forward to annex it. And only after Russia saw the reaction from the West on Crimea(no panishment or threat whatsoever), she started her actions in Donbass. And only at this point the West started with sanctions which probably contributed to the fact that Russia didnt went any further.

Im pretty sure that if the West acted menacingly in 2014, there wouldnt have been any problems in Ukraine today. Im also sure that if NATO decided to send its military to help Ukraine in Donbass today, the words ""there is no Russian military in Donbass, its only local militia"" would become true very quickly.

In the event a Player shall play in the AHL under other than an NHL contract, the Player and the AHL Club for which he plays shall enter into an AHL Standard Player’s Contract.

12588,"I think a (near-)global flood event was likely involved, based on its consistent mentions in mythology, as well as several instances of otherwise unexplainable findings of fossilized sea creatures at elevations where none should be.

I'm not sure how it occurred, or if it was accompanied by other cataclysmic events like a comet hitting the North American ice shelf as is sometimes considered, or a radical pole shift, or both.

There are definitely many missing pieces of information here and a lot of uncertainty on some pretty big things, but the idea that another global species of beings with an advanced understanding of the world around them who built things we couldn't build today with all the tools we have existed and then vanished is pretty much accepted reality for me at this point. Which is not to say I couldn't change my mind if you have a better argument to make against the idea.

&gt; However pyramids would surely be barely left standing after that long?

Pyramids would be about the only thing that can survive that long. They are basically man made mountains, and while they do erode, they remain largely intact over a very long time, as nothing can crumble, nothing can collapse, as there are virtually no spaces built into them other than a handful of specially enforced chambers.

The sphinx has experienced massive erosion, for example. And surprisingly most of it seems to be due to rain if you can believe it. This was another thing that led Hancock and others to consider that the sphinx is much older than conventional egyptologists are ready to admit, as the amount of erosion, coupled with what we know about the history of the climate in egypt would indicate that it was built in a time when egypt was no desert at all, but a rainforest. That was last the case, supposedly at least 10.000 years ago.

And as a side-note. There is a fair amount of evidence too, that the sphinx was originally depicting Anubis, and that the head was modified in the dynastic era of the pharaohs.

This is another point I would like to repeat. If you consider that another civilization built all those structures and was subsequently destroyed by a cataclysm, those cultures that would form after the flood/event in those areas would find those monuments inexplicable and use them for worship and all sorts of things, and generally take care of them, which is why many of them are still almost pristine.

Are you joking? Celtic are one of the most supported teams in the world, being strongly linked with the Irish diaspora worldwide. Outside the top 4 teams in England, no team has as many supporters as us, and arguably the top 4 only have that many fans because they win things which has drawn in large numbers of 'supporters' from the Far East etc.

Granted, the league as a whole is not that big but you're trying to compare a league in a country of about 5 million people to one of about 50 million, at least make a fair comparison. Half of the teams in the SPL are from towns of less than 80,000 people for christ sake, whilst not a single team in the EPL is. The Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Irish and Croatian leagues are far fairer comparisons, and the SPL matches up to them very well. 

That explains why we are currently at the standard we are - there is a much smaller market and so much less money, and so we cannot afford to or indeed attract big names. In the past decade we have performed far, far better than our financial situation should have allowed us to. If Celtic and Rangers moved to England with the fanbases we have, the massive increase in revenue we would receive as a result would propel us into being top teams.

In summary, KakarotsKid, I think I could probably speak for most Scottish football fans and say that we are quite glad that you don't have an interest in Scottish football, because quite frankly your views on it are incredibly simple-minded. And anyway, we don't watch the SPL because we're looking for a high quality of football - we're not the EPL, or La Liga, or Serie A, and we never will be and we're well aware of that - we watch the SPL because we support our teams no matter what.",soccer

The natives of South America have built far more bigger cities and civilizations than those who remained in northern North America (Canada) There is no denying to this fact.

Of course the reason why the natives of South America built more extensive nations than those who remained in North America, is mainly because of the climate.

Canada and the US have mostly continental and polar climates. South America however (and parts of Mexico) are of course mostly tropical. Which means much more plants and animals, so you have a lot more food, which means you can sustain a lot more people, which means you can build much bigger and powerful nations.

So there you have it. North American natives didn't have the wildlife resources or climate to support building a culture with cities and empires in mind. South American natives however were much more privileged and lucky because of what the land offered, and as a result were more advanced than their cousins in the north.

12634,"Q resets your attack counter so use it immediately after an attack.

W reduces cooldowns, so use it when you can to reduce the cooldown on your ult. You also have to choose whether to use it before or after Q depending on the situation. If you **really* need burst damage, use it before hand to get the knockup ASAP. Otherwise, use it afterwards for the CDR. You actually have to use it after the knockup to get CDR on your Q.

When trying to gank someone, use your E after they try to escape instead of beginning with it. Unless they're really low on health they'll probably try to fight a bit before running. It also slows enemies near the target you hit so if the enemy is just out of your range, you can use it on a nearbye minion to slow them and catch up. 

Your R damages for a percentage of enemy health which makes it kinda complicated. If you use your E to rush initiate a team fight and use your R you'll do a lot of damage but you'll probably die. If you wait to use it, it won't do as much damage. Depends on your build and team comp.

Unlike most AD/AS champions, Xin hao actually benefits more from AS then AD most of the time due to his passive, Q and E. Don't forget to build *some* AD on him though. Also, AS caps out at 2.5, so with your W you'll want to stop before 2. On the subject of Items, I've also found that ionian boots or merc boots help out a lot more then berserker greaves. I also like to start with a longsword and healthpot instead of a dagger since the extra AS won't help out much in the beginning. Having a ton of AS also makes Maerads Bloodrazor a great item.

Xin Zhao is a decent jungler, but there are far betters. I feel like his ability to get ganks sort of makes up for it though.

Early game, don't be too eager to rush in and kill people.

For skill order, I go R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E. I usually start off with an E though to make sure I can complete ganks.

Xin Zhao can either be a great melee DPS or a great tank. Pick one and go with it.

I moved out of Chicago to the middle of the country 4 years ago. Hockey isn't a big thing here. Well, 2 seasons ago it was game 7 of the Blackhawks/Blues series and I am sometimes in the Blues market. I turn on NBCSN where the game was being aired nationally and there was a premier league soccer rerun on. I was confused to I thought maybe it was on FSN-MW as the Blues sometimes aired on there and I was in their market so I switched and they were playing UFC and then the Royals. Okay, I was really lost now. I have NHL.tv but they don't play playoff games unless you're basically out of the US or using a vpn. I asked my cable company and they said the local NBC affiliates decided to air a rerun of a fucking soccer game on NBCSN instead of a game 7 NHL playoff game. So that game was completely blacked out in my state. Like, what the actual fuck!? I cancelled my cable after that because I was so mad. Not airing the games, especially when they are nationally aired definitely doesn't help grow the game. 

I was paying crazy money to have the NHL Network for when the Hawks were aired on there and I couldn't watch on NHL.tv if I didn't want to VPN, and I had every sports channel that offered any hockey. Plus NHL.tv. Yet, I was completely blacked out of a big playoff game. Yeah, that'll get us more fans!",hockey

It's a touchy subject. One that can never really be fixed; it's really hard to have general guidelines because of the many different cases there is.

Slaves is a miswording of Slav which is a white person from eastern europe originaly enslaved by Arabs and traded via Africa.  1 million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans  in the 1800s alone were enslaved in North Africa,  so your ancestors could have been slaves at one point as well. 

  The British had white slaves in America under their rule for a long part of our countries early beginnings.

It was so infuriating watching us lose those games because Manning had enough time to practically make an omelette every time he dropped back to pass.

That being said though, that 2006 game where we got nearly 400 yards rushing against you guys made it all mostly worth it, especially since you guys ended up winning the SB that year.

I don't know how true that is because I can't watch the film, but that makes sense.

Regardless, my greater point is that y'all did not have the talent to make the super bowl/win it. According to football outsiders, offense is more important than defense. It's an offensive league. That's why every single team in the championship was a top tier offense led by a top QB. In the divisional round, only two teams had a bad offense, and they both lost. 

Almost every single year, the super bowl winning team is one led by a top offense. At least in recent years. Even if you
look at winning teams known for their defense (Seahawks, Ravens), their offense was still quite good. Wilson with lynch, flaccos super bowl win was one of the best QB playoff performances statistically, and they scored tons of points. The Broncos had one of the best defenses in history, and they are the only
Super bowl winning team in recent memory to win despite their offense, and even then, manning was still leading them. 

Year in and year out, top defenses with average to below average offenses make the playoffs, then lose in later rounds. Chiefs, Texans, etc, it's almost always that way because offense just has more value. ",nfl

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/1a3f8a31cfb44611a907b604d05de44d.png)  

&gt; The Gregory Brothers’ unique musical stylings and comic rapport was largely formed when Evan Gregory, Michael Gregory, and Andrew Rose Gregory began making zany mix-tapes in their living room in Radford, Virginia as tiny babies. These (sadly lost) seminal works of musical comedy gently gestated for a few years until 2007, when the brothers joined forces with a bright-eyed lass from Texas. This musical collaboration with Evan’s wife, Sarah Gregory, was forged in the fiery crucible of an un-air-conditioned van during a summer tour that year. These sweaty bonds shall never be broken. After having experienced the elation of sharing their original country &amp; soul, folk ‘n’ roll tunes with several dozen people on that home-grown, 50 show tour, they began making their wildly viral YouTube series, “Auto-Tune the News” in 2008. Their meager hope was that several dozen more people would bump their rumps to C-Span if it thumped with a bass line and a beat.

&gt; While they continue to work on making their YouTube jams, The Gregory Brothers now tour the country speaking at colleges, playing at rock and comedy clubs, and are in the process of making a pilot for Comedy Central.

&gt; They have spoken at Google ZeitGeist, MacWorld, GEL, VidCon, Web 2.0 Expo, about how they combine music, technical savvy, and humor to reach millions. Their hit “The Bed Intruder Song” was the first YouTube video to cross over onto the Billboard Hot 100. They’re also proud to have collaborated with T-Pain, Weezer, Joel Madden, Tosh.0, Adidas, NPR, Sony Electronics, Chipotle, The Cleveland Show and The 83rd Annual Academy Awards. They are also the proud winners of three Webby Awards and two Comedy Awards.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ccf5e60bb1b3b5395d49ce44d45c6301.png)  

&gt; Kate Bush (born Catherine Bush on 30 July 1958 in Welling, Kent, England, now part of Greater London) is an English singer and songwriter known for her expressive four-octave soprano voice, idiosyncratic and literary lyrics, and eclectic and meticulous musical and production style. She debuted in 1978 with the surprise hit ""Wuthering Heights"", which was number one in the British music charts for four weeks and the first UK number one by female artist with a self-penned song. Kate will make again  UK chart history in 2014 by becoming the first female to score eight albums on the UK Official Albums Chart simultaneously.

&gt; Whilst learning the violin and piano at St. Joseph's Convent Grammar, she caught the ear of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour who funded some demos, ultimately leading to a deal with EMI (Pink Floyd's ultimate record company through the progressive Harvest imprint) when she was sixteen. Over the next two years EMI allowed her to hone her talents to and to finish school without releasing any material--while maintaining an exclusive contract.  Bush's first releases were in 1978 with the single Wuthering Heights (which went to number 1 in the UK) followed by the album The Kick Inside.

&gt; Even from her earliest works, featuring piano as a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding classical music, rock, and a wide range of folk sources, producing a unique amalgam which has continued throughout her career. Later recordings have moved farther from a rock base, however, notably with the release of The Dreaming in 1982, where she experimented heavily with the then-new technology of sampling.

&gt; Recorded in the same sessions as Bush’s reworking of old material,  Director's Cut, 50 Words For Snow  comprises seven songs “set against a background of falling snow.” The album was released through the singer’s personal imprint, Fish People, on November 21, 2011. It was Kate Bush's 10th studio album.
 
Kate Bush has tackled sensitive and taboo subjects long before it had become fashionable to do so; ""Kashka From Baghdad"" is a song about a gay male couple; ""Breathing"" explores the results of nuclear fallout. Her lyrics are often literate and reference a wide array of subject matter, some of which is relatively obscure, such as Wilhelm Reich in ""Cloudbusting"", or G.I. Gurdjieff in ""Them Heavy People"".

&gt; The lush arrangements, complex production and intelligent, thoughtful lyrics found in her work can sometimes mask the fact that Kate Bush is a peculiarly witty writer and that comedy is not only a big influence on her — she has cited Monty Python, Woody Allen, Fawlty Towers and The Young Ones as particular favourites — but also a significant component of her work. In addition to her British peers, Bush has reportedly cited American musicians Frank Zappa and Devo as musical influences.

&gt; As a vocalist, she has also provided backing vocals or duets with Peter Gabriel, Roy Harper, Big Country and others. She is often cited as an influence on later artists, most especially female singers such as Jane Siberry, Happy Rhodes and Tori Amos.

&gt; Kate Bush has collected two Ivor Novello awards: in 1979 'Outstanding British Lyric' for ""The Man With The Child In His Eyes"" and 'Outstanding Contribution To British Music As A Songwriter' in 2002.  In 1987 she scooped 'Best British Female Artist' at the Brit Awards.  In 2001, Kate won Q Magazine's 'Classic Songwriter' award, revealing an unlikely fan in John Lydon who announced, in his acceptance speech for the 'Inspirational Artist Award,' ""I'd like to say hello to Kate Bush, thank you, your music is f****ng brilliant"".

&gt; Kate's song ""Running Up That Hill"", from the 1985 album Hounds Of Love, has been covered by Placebo on a number of dates during their 2006 tour. The Futureheads, released a version of Kate's ""Hounds of Love"" as a single, which did rather well.
 
Early in 2014, Kate Bush announced her first tour for 35 years - the last being in 1979 when she performed the “Tour of Life”, a gruelling series of gigs that concluded with a concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. Tickets for the new tour went on sale on March 28, 2014 and all 22 dates sold out in less than 15 mins. In response, Kate published a message on her website - “I am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly positive response from everyone.  Thank you!”.  The tour, entitled “Before the Dawn”, started on Tuesday August 26, 2014 and ran through August and September 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo venue in the UK. The closing date was October the 1st.

Just because everyone else is doing something they shouldn't be doing doesn't make it okay. It would be safer if *everyone* followed the speed limit, which is why I don't consider matching the flow of traffic if everyone else is speeding to be a valid point, because it's unsafe.

McDonalds lost the rights to about half of their characters and phased out the ""McDonaldland"" concept that was ""inspired"" by HR Pufnstuf.

I'm not aware of any license that's divvied up by country in its totality, but I could be wrong - it's not like I'm looking at license agreements on a daily basis, but then again, no one here is either, so it's always a little frustrating to see things like this stated with such certainty. Trying to assess motivation is also very odd - wouldn't you want your anime to be seen by the most people possible? The anime industry in Japan values things like relationships and what the fans want more than looking at dollars and cents (and even if that weren't the case, a particular individual on the internet may not be the best judge of what's the most profit-maximizing way to do business on an international stage).

Licenses are grouped usually by region, and every region is organized differently by each publisher. You can find out what publisher Crunchyroll is licensing from on the show page, but there's certainly some nuance to that. You'll find trends by publisher, which reveal some interesting licensing insights if you pay close enough attention, but broadly, it comes down to competition. If it were as straightforward as a menu of countries that you could purchase, sure, that'd be helpful, but without going into too much detail, that's just not how licensing works, and that doesn't consider opportunity cost on the side of publishers in a world where every region has its own players.

When Crunchyroll licenses anime, we try to get as many countries as possible. For anime licensed from other Western partners, like Love Live Sunshine!! (via Funimation), we're limited to the countries that the partner licensed for. Funimation, for example, previously only had service available in the English-speaking world, so it didn't make sense for them to license globally - even if they want the rights for regions they don't immediately serve, the publisher would be most interested in local partners who are most capable of exploiting the most rights (local TV, localized merchandise, home video, etc.).

So for this title in particular, getting additional rights just wasn't on the table necessarily, and the process of changing the rights available is unbearably complex. It's a frustrating reality, but that's where we are. I'm really excited about CR's upcoming Summer line-up, keep track of how many of the titles are available in 150+ countries ;)",anime

3rd, the price of your meal is lower than it would be if the servers were being paid a living wage. The owner saves money by paying less, and asks for tips to bring up the servers' total earning to a fair level. If you don't tip, you are taking advantage of that system without putting as much input into the system as is expected, leading to the server not being paid a fair wage.

The most tedious one was also for the photographer ex.

I had to buy the episodes off of Amazon, and then a couple from itunes, figure out how to remove the ridiculous DRM off of both of them in order to burn them to DVDs. I also ripped all the extra material and deleted scenes from the VH1 website so each disc could have a bonus content section. Then I set up DVD menus and burnt each disc on a printable disc, and designed the disc labels and DVD covers. It really should have been way easier than it was. The DRM bit was the most ridiculous part.

Because that is something in favor of your side. In other words, you proposed something that benefits you, which was my first argument already. This is not how neutralism works.

&gt; If Cyprus is to be reunited, it will be about its own interests, not Turkish ones, not Greek ones

EU ones, well indirectly Greek ones. And you already previously tried to pull out some Enosis (unification of Cyprus with Greece, like small Megali Idea) bullshit there so it's pretty safe to assume Greek state has intentions over Cyprus. Why are you denying this? Like, I don't really deny the fact that Turkey is looking out for resources and influence in Eastern Mediterranean, and Cyprus is all about this.

Jensen has been carrying C9 this split, with a little bit of help from Contractz. Bjergsen has always been a clutch player and a rock in the mid lane for TSM, but the other 4 players on TSM are doing well this split and Bjergsen isn't solo carrying TSM on his back.

However, Bjergsen is in my opinion, a better player than Jensen, especially when you start looking at his consistency and non-laning factors like shot calling, clutch moments, leadership within the team, etc. I think as laners, they are probably fairly even and you'd get some sort of 50-50 record if you made them play a bunch of laning phase against each other.",leagueoflegends

13287,"&gt; These are more ""prestigious"" guys too

The examples you gave were of players that weren't good by year 2 of their deals, if they were ""prestigious"" players it was in name only. Thats more about the nature of NFL free agency, the artificial dollars teams throw at players that they will never see with shit like offset language and performance bonuses that would see you become the best player at your position before you see a dime of a bonus, If these players you picked were better than an average starter with a bloated contract they would have gone and signed elsewhere for the vet minimum. Kruger and Edwards toiled around with a couple teams but never saw the field again, Baker was done and cooked. You're presenting this to me like I have no knowledge of NFL contracts or the players who received them, I'm an avid NFL fan and well aware of the downfalls of their system, but I thought you'd pull better examples like DeSean Jackson getting cut for not getting along with Chip Kelly, and the lack of protection present in the language of the contract that would have made the Eagles think twice about just dumping a good player in his prime. 

The equivalent to those guys are Ville Leino, or Christian Erhoff who signed big deals, were bad under them, and were bought out by the Sabres within 3 years of signing them. Leino got 10/15M owed to him on top of 12M in salary in 3 years. Erhoff got 18M in bonuses and 14.6M from the remainder of his contract. Leino got 22M total for 2 years, Erhoff got 32.6M for 3 years. Without the recapture for the players, it's admittedly not close, NFL players net more in a shorter period of time, but it's more similar than I expected before I calculated what each was paid. However, the recapture still I would argue does not go far enough because it pays that 2/3 of the contract over double the amount of term left on the contract. Erhoff see that 14.6M over 14 years, and Leino gets his 10M over 8 years, over which time inflation occurs and makes that sum of money less and less over time in a compounding nature. But in summary, NFL money vs. NHL money, NFL money is higher/bigger numbers and with that comes earning potential (what we all strive for) with the trade off of security while NHL money is definitely more secure but far fewer dollars and far less earning potential. 


&gt;I'm admittedly not too familiar with the NHL's contract system but it looks like buyouts still pay out 33% of your salary if under 26 and 66% if over, on top of the full signing bonus. That's way better than for NFL players who get a big fat 0 outside of their signing bonus.

Your understanding of the NHL buyout system is 100% correct, but your conclusion that it's way better than the NFL system is misguided IMO. I just ran those numbers for you up there, compare them to the Kruger, Edwards, Baker example you gave and you still have those guys getting almost 1/2 or 2/3 of their deals in 2 years or less. That's still significant and deserves to be acknowledged. 

The other variable in this is how the players negotiate those deals. Some players trade that security for earning potential, and some guys sign the Suh deals and put their teams in a crunch after year 1 because of guaranteed $ (i take no issue with Suh doing it, but it is a fact). I can remember the Ricky Williams Saints contract had performance bonuses that meant he would have had to match or beat Walter Payton's best season before he got the full value of his contract and bonuses, while the PB's below that were still 1500 yards and 12 TD's and just gaudy numbers. This was his ROOKIE deal. If teams have a guy that's willing to sign that, should we legislate that they can't? And does that reflect on the Player's union because the player took a bad deal for himself. I don't see how contract negotiations reflect back of the any leagues PA, that occurs between the agent, player, and team. 

&gt;As far as revenue sharing, looks like the NHL players get 50% while NFL is at 47-48%

Thank you, appreciate you sharing that info.

&gt;I did (mistakenly) think that NHL contracts were fully guaranteed, so it's not quite as lopsided as I originally thought, but they still have a much better parachute than NFL players.

Not like you were far off, I knew what you meant by it. They definitely have a better parachute than most NFL players, but if those NFL players actually negotiated for more security, they could be just as well off. Trade some of the 30 million dollars you'll never see on the base salary and turn it into 15 in roster bonuses in late April and we wouldn't see these actually good football players being dumped after the draft or late in FA.",hockey

Probably lesser since the distance was calculated from the center to center of each continent and Max's party was already on the Australian west coast. To make it to S. America in 160 days, you would have to cover roughly 80 kilometers each day, which motorcycles can cover that distance in an hour. So it would be 160 hours or less to make it to Argentina.

Historically highly unlikely. The two parties may not differ much ideologically, but they represent different 'traditions' and different approaches to the work of government as well as to the 'national question' of the North.

For example, an FF-Sinn Fein coalition is unlikely but possible, whereas an FG-Sinn Fein coalition is nearly impossible.

By tradition, the two large parties represent the two sides in the Irish civil war that followed independence, which was largely fought on the question of whether to accept the partition of the North or not. Research work done recently suggests that Fine Gael is dominated by the 'Old English' (the descendants of Norman and English settlers) while Fianna Fáil is dominated by the 'Native Irish', so there's a split there that goes back centuries. And Fine Gael do represent a more 'British' approach to governance than FF does.",europe

""It is in the German memoir 'Sniper on the Eastern Front'. It is March 1945, and the Germans have been pushed back by the Russians into Germany and Czechoslovakia. He was scouting some German village in the Sudetenland. A Russian platoon drove around, so he hid in a caved out building, so this lone sniper had a front row seat to the horror to what was to follow. The platoon was plundering the village until it ran into this German couple. The Russians then tied up the husband, and forced him to watch as the Russians, in order of ranking personnel, raped the wife. One. By. One. She was screaming in agony, fell in and out of consciousness, and was in so much pain. When the last Russian was finished with her, he shoved a flare gun up the woman's vagina, and fired it. The woman screamed out the most 'animalistic, brutal, and haunting scream' the German has ever heard, as the flare was slowly burning the woman's insides and blood/flare residue/flames were rushing out of her body, and then she slumped over dead. German reinforcements soon arrived, and killed/wounded the platoon. The husband went into his house, grabbed an object (I recall it was a shovel) and hacked the remaining wounded Russians on the ground until they were all dead. Some of the Germans tried stopping him, but the lone sniper held them back.""

**What does the current value for var represent?**

*Value for sv var when server performance is meeting tickrate requirements represents the standard deviation of accuracy of server OS nanosleep function measured in microseconds over the history of last 50 server frames. The latest update relies on it for efficiently sleeping and waking up to start next frame simulation. Should usually be fractions of milliseconds. Value for client var near fps net graph display is showing standard deviation of client framerate measured in milliseconds over the history of last 1000 client frames. By using fps_max to restrict client rendering to maintain a consistent fps client can have framerate variability at a very low value, but keep in mind that system processes and 3rd party software can influence framerate variability as well.*

You may be confusing the cause with the symptom; something is causing your computer to stutter/rubberband, which causes var to rise.

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

13414,"That paraphrases to the official response ""Unexplained but not suspicious.""

I imagine (and am admittedly prone to wild fantasy) one (or possibly two) rather large men going to visit Mr Hoare and 'persuading' him to drink/take a little something they brought along for him.

""Come on son, get this down your neck. You knew this day would be coming.""",worldnews
13415,"&gt;Do you think the mixing of genuine cultural traditions causes them to evaporate? 

I think in the case of North American natives that is especially true, their cultures weren't destroyed by consumerism. They were destroyed by the mixing with new settlers who had no qualms with overpowering them.

&gt;Or would you consider it more plausible that the vast majority of people being shoehorned in 1 way of life filled with metric tons of marketing and products changes their traditions?

I think happy people don't buy shit to fill the void in their heart. Many things make people unhappy, being among strangers being one of them. Perhaps you are right that the more likely cause is an urban, productionist lifestyle though.

&gt;We have had cultural exchanges for centuries without the creation of music ""dying"".

Fair point, my anecdote about making music with the family is silly, If anything destroyed that tradition it was the advent of the radio.

&gt;The mixing and sharing of cultures is an old tradition that has not accelerated at break neck speeds despite modern changes since it ultimately requires 2 humans to have a genuine interaction

On the contrary, I think it genuinely has. China and Japan are nothing like they were 150 years ago and that is entirely due to the effects of worldwide travel, enabling the spread of ideas and trade from Europe to them. The crisis of the inability of those cultures to compete with western culture led to drastic violent change. That's not to say they were monolithic or even that they were unchanging for thousands of years, but the pace of change IS increasing.

&gt;The solution to multiculturalism is not monoculturism. Besides people have terrible taste and I do not wish to depend on them to pick the correct ""mono""

I'd agree with you on that, It seems impossible to put the genie back in the bottle, certainly not without trampling over peoples human rights. I just don't know how to make our societies healthy and happy. I think people naturally wish to be involved with the people most like themselves(based on any number of factors, race not necessarily being the most important). I also think that people will naturally homogenize themselves, if that weren't the case we wouldn't have issues with political echo chambers.

So there seems to be two forces diametrically opposed to one another. Modern societies tendency to place people into a cultural ""blender"" and peoples natural desire to be surrounded by those they see [commonalities with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight). I don't think people are happy when they are torn between opposing forces, and I worry that humanities tendency towards violence will only be exacerbated by this. Even worse is these fault lines in our culture can grow vaster when there is economic downturns. Political opportunists can exploit these fault lines for their own gain, often at the expense of human rights. I would prefer that our societies minimize the likelihood of those fault lines forming in the first place.

Edit: I appreciate your responses so far, they are well thought out and are more than one or two sentences! I love arguing online, but only when people are engaged in the discussion.

Nobody is reading this thinking, ""Oh. Moss only had one 1500-yard season. I stand corrected.""

Moss didn't get near enough targets in his career. Part of it was the defense overcompensating; part of it was OCs using him as a decoy too often; and part of it was QBs being too safe/unskilled.

Do these places just need to hire less terrible managers or what? Does the food cost 3x as much in other countries or is it because of portion size?

A change that I would have been happy to see in Roadhog was a slight reduction to the length of his hook, for example reducing it from 20 meters to somewhere between 12-15 meters.

However, when it comes to heroes like, for example Hanzo, you may not hit every scatter arrow and if you did then every scattered arrow may not even hit! And this can be said the same for Roadhog due to a player needing to be accurate with the hook.
(I personally I as a player have not been killed by scatters as much as they have done damage to me so that might be why I don't understand the hate towards the OHKs..)

I think OHKs make the game exciting as it adds to that element of risk when running into a certain hero! But having a low margin of error on a hero when performing a OHK and having other heroes potentially not be as consistent I think that needs to be addressed.

In search for his familiy he moves back to this blue house and two girls show up at his door, both having a copy of the old picture and both claim to be his twin.

- [Candy Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4535/Candy_Boy:_Nonchalant_Talk_of_the_Certain_Twin_Sisters_in_Daily_Life) is about two sisters that share a room together in the dorms at their high school. One day a girl from their school seeks out one of the sisters. The other one shortly after learns from a friend that said girl admired her sister for a long time now. Various events lead to the second sister confessing her feelings for the other one.

- [Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/819/Boku_wa_Imouto_ni_Koi_wo_Suru) follows a brother/sister relationship. The siblings were always close as kids and still live in the same room with bunker beds. The brother tho is in love with his sister and the whole 'forbidden love' thing is causing him sleepless nights. He tries to stay away from her (what confuses her because they are normally really close), applies to attend a boarding school and even tries to ease his desire for his sister by sleeping with her best friend. When his sister started talking about having a boyfriend he couldn't stay quiet anymore and confessed.

- [**Koi Kaze (recommendation)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/634/Koi_Kaze) is about a man who works as a wedding planer and isn't able to commit himself wholeheartedly to love because of it. After being dumped by his girlfriend he had a chance encounter with a female high school student which shakes his calm and awakens new feelings in him. Shortly after he learns that this girl is in fact his sister that lived with his mother who divorced his dad many years ago and is now staying with him and his dad.

- [**Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone. (recommendation)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8861/Yosuga_no_Sora:_In_Solitude_Where_We_Are_Least_Alone.) is about a brother and his sister who just lost their parents in an accident. They move to a rural town where they once spent summers with their grandfather. Everything seems familiar and peaceful until the brother starts to remember things from his youth. (This anime is a visual novel adaption and tries to go into every girls' route. As an example that isn't accurate.. They will show the intro story followed seemlessly by the start of girl route A.. When the story finishes you'll notice that it goes a bit back in time to an intersection point and follows the next girls story. Everything is tied up with the last 3 episodes or so being about the siblings themselves... (best arc))

- [NAKAIMO - My Little Sister Is Among Them!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) has a nice setup for a story but is actually just another comedy ecchi harem. Guys' father dies and he only gets the inheritance if he attends a certain school and finds someone to marry. The only problem is that a girl from this school claims to be his sister but he doesn't know who exactly. Can he find his future bride without picking the sister?

- [Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) is not really incesty but it has a nice premise that confronts the problems of suddenly being a dad. Imagine a sister and a brother that lost their parents. The sister raised his brother alone until she married years later... She asks him to take care of her 3 daughters (two of them coming from her husbands earlier marriages and a really young one being her own) while she is on a trip with her husband. He unwillingly accepts the job but the plane his sister took went missing. In order to prevent the daughters from being adopted separately by relatives, Yuta decided to take in all three girls and raise them like his sister raised him.

- [**Oreimo (The most popular)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai) follows a broken brother/sister relationship. One day he finds a DVD of a magical girl anime in the entranceway of his house. To his surprise there was actually an eroge (adult video game) titled Imouto to Koishiyo! (Love with Little Sister!) in it. He tries to finds out who the owner is by bringing up the topic of magical girl anime at the family dinner table. All that comes out is a strong negative reaction from his parents, especially his anti-otaku policeman father. In the same night his sister bursts into his room and, in perhaps the first conversation she has initiated with him in years, says they ""have things to talk about."" She brings him to her room and shows him an extensive collection of moe anime and lolicon bishoujo games she has been collecting in secret.",anime

I agree.  Many of the types of typical  injuries that happen over the course of a match (ankle sprains, studs on the ankle, knee) can leave you completely unable to walk off the field at first, but after only a few minutes you can be on your feet and ready to get back on the pitch.  

Forcing players to sit out for a long time like 10 minutes only serves to encourage players to try to injure their opponent to keep them off the pitch.  If everyone time you took someone's feet out they had to sit out for 10  minutes many guys would make it their primary strategy to get teams down to 10 or 9 men and take advantage of that, and just accept the yellow cards they'll probably pick up along the way.

That didn't used to exist, because orgs were just random opportunists and teams were just gamers playing together.

And in EU, to a large extent, that's still true. Fnatic, G2 and Misfits seem pretty organised (UoL too, to a lesser extent) but many of the LCS teams don't have much in the way of structure or investment - they just live split-to-split, and when someone gets an offer from a better side, or starts playing like shit or whatever, the teams gets relegated and the org disappears.

The NA scene hasn't just got stronger by itself - it's got stronger because even low-end orgs can afford to spend big cash on player salaries or team houses or analysts or whatever. It wasn't that long ago that the NA challenger scene was a total joke, where a bunch of has-been rejects from EU (Krepo, Snoopeh, Yellowpete) were able to go to NA and get straight into LCS when they wouldn't have even been offered a starting spot on most EU challenger rosters at the time.

But now NA challenger has tons of well-funded orgs that can afford to bring in pros like Fox/Gillius, fail, then try again with Dandy/GBM.

13717,"&gt; You are a layman who reads clickbait headlines and thinks he has an inkling on where Russia fits into the global stage.

You have no idea what I read. The fact that you are willing to plunge ahead with claims like that that you have no evidence for undermines your well thought out and sourced post representing a bullish outlook on the Russian economy and investment. Maybe defending the motherland gets you emotional, I don't know. 

As to you actual arguments. Russia being so reliant on the nat. resources sector, particularly oil/gas, is a long term liability. To mitigate global warming, we simply cannot burn all the oil and gas left in the earth that we know about. So states like Russia and the gulf Arab states are counting assets that ultimately they will never be able to access. If they are allowed to, it means a pretty bleak future for our planet. Additionally, there has been substantial public reporting on the continued falling cost of renewables. We have already seen investors pulling back from fossil fuel projects due to this trend; if the trend continues at even a modest pace renewables will supplant oil/gas as primary sources of energy in the next 40 years. 

On the subject of their investment in education and healthcare, they were ranked 112th in 2012 in terms of spending on education as a percentage of GDP. You also mentioned healthcare, where they lag behind the OECD despite some improvements. Think for a minute about how Russia got to its current ranking. Decades of mismanagement and cronyism under the Soviet system and then the looting of the country since the fall. Coming out of the cold war, Russia should have been able to lower military expenditure and make investments. Most of the stability created by Putin has been by limiting political and personal expression in the name of right-wing conformity. IMO, a country cannot be successful in the long run without substantial investment in its future or a functioning civil society. Is it improving? Yes. Should and would it be much further along in its progress if it wasn't so terribly managed? Yes. 

Why does Reddit hate Russia? Well, Russia is a notoriously anti-democratic country with poor human rights policies and records. Russia is anti-LGBTQ to say the least and persecutes a number of marginalized groups. Reddit trends left of center, so those stances are not going to be popular. Also, the well documented spamming of sites like reddit by Putin bots is fairly annoying.

13737,"Copy and pasted from my theory post

I know others believe this but idk if they have presented this evidence.

I think his name is Aemon and here is why, besides slowing down Lyannas whisper scene and watching it repeatdly.

First off the popular Jaehaerys theory is based off the name of Jon Snows great grand father Jaehaerys II (from the novels) and he was a good king and he was named after the greatest king, the original Jaehaerys I. Well in the tv show Jaeharys II does not exist they cut his whole generation out.

In the books its like this Maekar&gt;Aegon&gt;Jaehaerys&gt;Aerys&gt;Rhaegar&gt;Jon In show it is like this Maekar&gt;Aegon&gt;Aerys&gt;Rhaegar&gt;Jon

So you see an entire generation has been omitted in the TV series a generation which was in part the foundation of the Jaehaerys theory. Maestor Aemon is the brother of both of the Aegons book and TV series. Being Jons Great Great Great Uncle in the Books and Jons Great Great Uncle in the TV show.

So if Jons name was Aemon he would bear the same name as his great great uncle Maester Aemon who in turn was named after his great great uncle Aemon the Dragonknight. Aemon the Dragonknight also had a brother named Aegon who was also king. ""Prince Aemon the Dragonknight has been referred to as the noblest knight who ever lived, and his skill with a sword is legendary throughout Westeros."" Noble and awesome swordsman sounds like our Jon.

The Dragonknight was also a LORD COMMANDER but of the kings guard instead of the Nights Watch. So Jon was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch which gives him a trait of both of the previous Aemons. Since one was a Lord Commander and the other was a member of the Nights Watch.

Maester Aemon was also the one who believed in The Prince that was Promised prophecy he believed Jons father Rhaegar was TPTWP. Rhaegar later believed that it was probably his son Aegon but he died too.

So if Jon was named Aemon, him and his brothed Aegon would be third set of Aegon Aemon brothers with Aemon being king instead of Aegon.

So if Bran told Jon ""Your Aemon Targaryan"" it would be the same thing Jon told Maester Aemon when he found out his identitiy.

Also to consider, Rhaegar and his Great Uncle Maestor Aemon wrote each other frequently and he told his uncle how he no longer thought he was the TPTWP and that he thought it was his son. Meaning he liked his Great uncle and confided in him and probably would be willing to name a child after him.",gameofthrones

These engineers and architects are implying the missing energy came from controlled demolitions. That story seems consistent with observations and cold hard physics. The problem comes from what happens when you entertain that possibility. If there were explosives, why wasn't this investigated and who had access to the building to plant them?

The scene cuts with Cersei still in Maggie's hut. Book readers know that Maggie gives the last bit about the Valonquar for free not as an answer to one of the questions. Not showing Cersei leave the hut leaves room for more that could have been said but not shown. Jamie doesn't know about the prophecy so he doesn't have the same hate for Tyrion as Cersei does. She has already asked him to kill Tyrion after Joffery and Jamie refuses. If she asks again he might ask why the hate, Jamie doesn't believe Tyrion killed Joffery. She then could explain the prophecy to him. The show only reveled the first half of the prophecy because that's all that was relevant to the current seasons story plot. The books introduce plots and leave them hanging for a long time. 
R+L=J was known by every book reader for years now. Not directly but in the book there was plenty of clues. If you only watch the show and never google book spoilers then it would've been a huge revelation! The show makes it clear Jon is lianna's baby by cutting to him from the babies face.

It's *at least* a top 5 composition in my book because of how simple yet effective the layering of the various elements is. There's never a section longer than maybe 8 seconds without some layer variation, be it the vocals, the bass, the guitar, the violin, the beat, whatever. Yet usually only one or two layers change at a time, so it remains very smooth listening without ever stagnating; the song's energy is derived from both subtle and overt sources. It's also perfectly representative of the franchise as a whole from visual/sound design and emotional perspectives, and it's catchy as hell to boot.


I legit have to resist typing out any more because this song is *criminally* underrated for the amount of depth it packs, and I almost never get the chance to talk about it since not many people care about it relative to other songs.

I can find only anecdotal (no supporting documentation, such as the original magazine publication) reporting of the changes that were made between the 1898 and the 1912 repub.

Just because an authoritative scientific body, or a majority of population holds a view does not directly translate to that view being correct.

To really know about a subject you have to get into the details, otherwise you have arrived at a conclusion without logic ever coming into the picture.  Do you think people who believe the official story of 9/11 have ever looked into the details of it?   Do you think they even know what the official story is?

Sixth is Patriots of Russia and the last one is the Right Cause.

The funny thing about this picture is the fact that that particular election was famous for the massive vote fraud going on around the country, and therefore the 146% became a massive meme in Russia, making fun of the obviously rigged elections and overall corruption of the country, commonly applied when another ""Putin has the 99,9999% approval rate"" news story gets shared by the Internet news sources.",worldnews

Not easy leaving a place you lived your entire adult life in. You gotta remember these are human beings. Also much of the stuff written is by PR staff, not KD himself.

Why didn't KD call Russ? I think he was genuinely scared of Russ. They always had a good professional relationship, but were not really friends. Regardless he should have called Russ. Not an excuse but I can kinda understand.  But lets say you left a job. Do you call your former workmates and explain why you left? Probably not.  This is a job. Its professional, not personal.  I think KD wanted to make this split 100% professional with Russ.

[Sources are at the bottom.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak#Responsibility)

&gt; Also, there is virtually no difference between state-run media and corporate-run oligarchy networks like CNN/FOX/MSNBC. There is almost zero diversity of opinion in the media space.

There's a big difference. In America, where we have corporate-run oligarchies, we have reports from both sides with different slants depending on the source. Hence you have some Americans that hate Trump, while you also have some Americans that love Trump. Depending on what media they consume.

In Russia, a state-run media, the government is the single controller. So they only report positively on the government and Putin.

And I quote: *""Meanwhile Putin is widely popular in Russia. If he's so terrible why do the Russian people like him so much?""*

&gt; These two opposing ""teams"" that seemingly transcend elections and push for uniform policy (with a few notable exceptions) are why people believe in the Deep State. The leaders change but the policy doesn't

Wow. There's a lot to unpack there.

1. Deep State. Never heard of it before now. Will forget it in the future. It's a conspiracy theory and I don't give conspiracy theories any weight *sans evidence*.
2. Leaders change but the policy doesn't. No idea what you're talking about. Each POTUS has been different from the previous one.

All I can say is, this is all very conspiratorial. Again, without *evidence* there's nothing to talk about.

&gt; come election time the primary system has been rigged such that the vote on Nov 8th merely picks a side of the same coin.

I think you're confusing what the President's position is *supposed* to be. Candidates are **supposed** to be similar to each other. Both are supposed to be **moderates** (in the center) which lean slightly left or slightly right. This is so that the POTUS can represent the most people's views. Being extremely left or extremely right marginalizes the other half of the voting populace. Like right now, Trump has marginalized at least half of the country.",worldnews
